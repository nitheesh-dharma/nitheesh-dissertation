Are you happy with this? I &lt;br&gt;have not altered this in the main text. Whilst you were happy to include &lt;br&gt;LABAs in the review there were no studies on this found and it helps the &lt;br&gt;reader of the abstract to interpret the results if it is clear that &lt;br&gt;short acting is what was actually considered in this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;We take your point, but would prefer to keep the review objectives as&lt;br&gt;including all beta-agonists and then say that only short acting studies were&lt;br&gt;found in practice (see revised abstract). We think that it would not have&lt;br&gt;been appropriate to include head-to-head comparisons of LABAs with short&lt;br&gt;acting anticholinergics (but we have not analysed this comparison anyway).

I MISSED THIS BEFORE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have moved the sentence about short medium and long-term duration down &lt;br&gt;to the methods section as it was confusing in relation to outcomes in &lt;br&gt;view of the way the protocol has been split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a great help to readers if you could alter the sentences in &lt;br&gt;red in the description of studies to give the reference to each study &lt;br&gt;according to co-intervention with steroids please, and the other &lt;br&gt;characteristics that are mentioned in this paragraph.***** ACTION NEEDED &lt;br&gt;PLEASE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Done &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; GREAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My view is that it is reasonable to say that the 7% increase in PEF is &lt;br&gt;of little significance IF the patients were not very severe.

Nice explanation of the protocol split - thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: very clearly laid out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine but scale changed to show symptom scores more clearly. Please add scale to the outcome titles for PEF and symptom scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: well written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If a study did not report allocation details, but the allocation could have been randomised or quasi-randomised, the study was included and further information was sought from the authors.&amp;quot; These were then excluded if randomisation could not be confirmed byt the authors? I have reworded this, please check.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Analysis was carried out only for comparisons 2 and 3 for the longer-term studies.&amp;quot; Was this an a priori decision or related to the data available?&lt;br&gt;******* &amp;quot;All similar parallel and crossover studies with sufficient data were pooled using the fixed effects generic inverse variance method in RevMan Version 4.2 to give a weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.&amp;quot; PLEASE REPORT RHO IN THE RESULTS FROM THE IPD DATA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of Studies&lt;br&gt;Very clear. How did you prepare your flowchart (out of interest) as this would be a good model for other reviews?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodological quality of studies&lt;br&gt;****** As the Jadad measures are not being used it would help to include some more information here on blinding and dropouts in all the studies at this point (as you have done above for patients and interventions etc). As you have mentioned a blinding problem for one study are the others all open, or adequately blinded? Ipatropium and Salbutamol taste quite different which might merit a mention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Taytard 1984 was analysed separately because the trialists reported a combined 'clinical score', which was a composite of day-time and night-time symptom scores and drug consumption for symptomatic relief. For this study, only first period results were used (because the authors reported an order effect); the study reported individual patient data and because of large baseline differences, the change scores were used.&amp;quot; Fair enough but there will be bias whichever way around the results are entered, this is one of the biggest problems with small studies. Bearing in mind the results from the other studies a composite day and night score may be impossible to interpret. &lt;br&gt;Comparison 2 - &amp;quot;For all studies the final values of the outcome measures were used, rather than adopting change scores.&amp;quot; Sensible to reduce bias by doing this.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In Haahtela 1991, the peak flows and symptom scores were reported as a daily average for weeks 1-4 and, separately, 9-12 weeks; we used the mean of 1-4 and 9-12 weeks as a measure of the response. Philip-Joet 1990 reported the weekly mean peak flows and standard deviations for weeks 1 to 8. However, there were such a large number of missing patients (e.g., at 8 weeks, 26 of 103 from the combination arm and 22 of 95 from the &amp;#223;2-agonist arm) that we decided to include only the results for the first week as being the least confounded (still 11/103 and 12/95 missing).&amp;quot; Clearly a trade-off here but seems a sensible to way to minimise attrition bias.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Thirdly, the &amp;#223;2-agonist in the two arms differed in both composition and dose. We decided to treat all the &amp;#223;2-agonists as having the same equivalence and recorded the difference in doses in a single variable, the ratio of &amp;#223;2-agonist in the combination arm to that in the single arm. Two ratios were analysed 1:1 and 1:2 - the latter can be considered as the substitution of anticholinergic for some of the &amp;#223;2-agonist in the single arm and the former as the addition of anticholinergic to the same level of &amp;#223;2-agonist.&amp;quot; This is a nightmare! Very sensible to carry out minimal meta-analysis!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As a chronic disease, with no known cure, the accepted goals of management in chronic asthma are to minimise the adverse impact of the disease on the patient's physical and mental well-being, to prevent long term damage with fixed airflow obstruction and to reduce mortality. In the majority of patients treatment is therefore directed at improving physiological end-points and patient-perceived physical and mental health. Although anticholinergics are frequently used in patients with more severe forms of asthma, the evidence justifying its use remains limited. Both short-term and long-term anticholinergics are of some benefit in patients with COPD, their role in asthma is less clearly defined. The recent BTS guidelines include anticholinergics as one of the options for short term bronchodilator relief at Step 1, and in the management of acute severe asthma (BTS/SIGN 2004). They receive no mention as regular add-on treatment for use in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists.&amp;quot; Very clear summary of the possible roles for anticholinergics.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Similarly, there were no significant trends in respect of secondary outcome measures.&amp;quot; I HAVE REWORDED THIS (in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The addition of anticholinergics to regular inhaled bronchodilators does not confer significant benefits, which would justify their routine use.&amp;quot; I HAVE REWORDED THIS (in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Wiley will need to check that Beta2 and RHO shown correctly in the final review so I will leave this for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults (WITH CHRIS 050404)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults (WITH CHRIS 300404)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults (WITH CHRIS 300404)&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults (WITH CHRIS AWAITING FINAL APPROVAL 210504)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-11 16:19:33 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett" REVIEW_NO="#ACH-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Anticholinergic agents such as Atrovent are sometimes used to treat people with asthma as a bronchodilator that opens up the airways in the lungs. This review found that although this treatment was better than placebo, the size of the effect was rather small. When the drug was used in combination with more widely used bronchodilators (beta-agonists such as fenoterol), it did not appear to add much benefit. However, there are concerns about the quality of the studies that have been analysed. It could be that there are some adults with chronic asthma who respond to treatment with anticholinergic drugs, but the review has not been able to identify their common characteristics. <BR/> </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-09-19 15:01:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium bromide are sometimes used in the treatment of chronic asthma. They effect bronchodilation and have also been used in combination with ß2 -agonists in the management of chronic asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effectiveness of anticholinergic agents versus placebo and in comparison with ß2 -agonists or as adjunctive therapy to ß2 -agonists. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-19 15:01:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group asthma and wheeze database was searched with a pre-defined search strategy. Searches were current as of August 2008. Reference lists of articles were also examined.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials were considered for inclusion. Studies assessing an anticholinergic agent versus placebo or in combination/comparison with ß2 -agonists were included. In practice, all ß2 -agonists were short acting. Short-term (less than 24 hours duration) were not considered for this review. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed abstracts for retrieval of full text articles. Papers were then assessed for suitability for inclusion in the review. Data from included studies were extracted by two reviewers and entered into the software package (RevMan 4.2). We contacted authors for missing data and some responded. Adverse effect data were analysed if reported in the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-30 15:37:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The studies analysed were in two groups: those comparing anticholinergics with placebo and those comparing the combination of anticholinergics with short acting ß2 -agonists versus short acting ß2 -agonists alone. The former group had 13 studies involving 205 participants included in this review, and the latter 9 studies involving 440 patients. Generally methodological quality was poorly reported, and there were some reservations with respect to the quality of the studies. Despite the limited number of studies that could be combined, anticholinergic agents in comparison with placebo resulted in more favourable symptom scores particularly in respect of daytime dyspnoea (WMD -0.09 (95%CI -0.14, -0.04, 3 studies, 59 patients). Daily peak flow measurements also showed a statistically significant improvement for the anticholinergic (e.g. morning PEF: WMD =14.38 litres/min (95%CI 7.69, 21.08; 3 studies, 59 patients). However the clinical significance is small and in terms of peak flow measurements equates to approximately a 7% increase over placebo. The more clinically relevant comparison of a combination of anticholinergic plus short acting ß2 -agonist versus short acting ß2 -agonist alone gave no evidence in respect of symptom scores or peak flow rates of any significant differences between the two regimes. Again there are reservations with respect to the quality of the information from which these conclusions are drawn. An update search in August 2004 did not identify any new studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Overall this review provides no justification for routinely introducing anticholinergics as part of add-on treatment for patients whose asthma is not well controlled on standard therapies. This does not exclude the possibility that there may be a sub-group of patients who derive some benefit and a trial of treatment in individual patients may still be justified. The role of long term anticholinergics such as tiotropium bromide has yet to be established in patients with asthma and any future trials might draw on the messages derived from this review.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-24 10:52:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is the commonest chronic disease affecting all age groups in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1998</LINK>), and has been recognised and treated in the East for centuries (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1984</LINK>). The anticholinergic agent, atropine was probably the first treatment used for asthma and was introduced in the West in the early 1800s (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1984</LINK>). Atropine acts as a bronchodilator, but has adverse effects, even at doses close to those used for bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>), and, as a result, fell from favour following the commercial development of ephedrine and adrenaline - beta-agonists - in the 1920s and, later, the methylxanthines. However, in the 1970s a quaternary ammonium synthetic analogue of atropine, ipratropium bromide, was developed, which gave few systemic side effects and revived interest in the anticholinergics (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>). A recent study in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>) showed that anticholinergics were prescribed for asthma in 7 of 85 cases (8%) - age range 18-54 years, with a range of disease severities. Data from a UK general practice database on new use bronchodilators in severe asthma showed that, of 14657 patients, 20% received ipratropium bromide (<LINK REF="REF-Meier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anticholinergic agents act as bronchodilators. The rationale for using them in asthma is based on the assumption that activation of the parasympathetic (cholinergic) nerve pathway is an important mechanism for producing airway obstruction. Anticholinergics work by competing with acetylcholine for receptor sites at the vagus nerve-nerve or nerve-muscle junctions. This prevents transmission of reflexes induced by asthma stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Beakes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beakes 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until the early 1980s, the treatment for asthma was regular bronchodilator agents (especially short-acting selective ß2 -agonists - the successors to adrenaline and ephedrine) and other agents were added only when symptoms reached an unacceptable level of frequency or severity (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1998</LINK>). Treatment was based around relieving the symptoms (airway constriction) and patients were often encouraged to tolerate continuing symptoms, treating them when necessary with repeated doses of ß2 -agonists. However, in the mid 1980s, opinions on asthma changed rather strikingly, because asthma was recognised as a chronic inflammatory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>). The therapeutic emphasis in chronic asthma in adults changed to embrace agents that suppress the underlying inflammation, notably inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma guidelines have been available since the late 1980s and are updated regularly (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Creer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creer 1999</LINK>). Initially they were arrived at by consensus, based on discussion and state-of-the-art literature reviews. More recent guidelines such as the BTS/SIGN guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2004</LINK>) have adhered to systematic electronic searching and standardised guideline methodology. The grades of recommendation are derived from levels of evidence. According to current guidelines, the early introduction of anti-inflammatory treatment in the form of inhaled steroids is indicated for all but the mildest forms of asthma. Bronchodilators are adjuvant treatments used in one of two ways. Firstly, short-acting bronchodilators in the form of ß2 -agonists are used as-needed to relieve episodic symptoms. Secondly, in patients whose asthma is inadequately controlled despite regular inhaled steroids, the addition of long-acting ß2 -agonists has been shown to improve lung function and symptoms, and to decrease exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>). A small proportion of patients have asthma which is not adequately controlled despite moderate doses of inhaled steroid and a long-acting ß2 -agonist. There are few clinical trials in this specific patient group and possible options include an increase in the dose of inhaled steroid or additional treatment, which might include leukotriene receptor antagonists, theophyllines or anticholinergics.</P>
<P>It is a widely held view that anticholinergics are less effective than ß2 -agonists in the symptomatic treatment of chronic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 1998</LINK>), although there is considerable variation in treatment effect amongst patients. Attempts to identify subgroups that respond better to anticholinergics have not been very successful. In general, though, anticholinergics may be better in the following: older patients - the ß2 -agonist responsiveness apparently declines with age (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Connolly-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 1993</LINK>); patients intolerant to ß2 -agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Boulet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 1999</LINK>); patients with nocturnal asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Beakes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beakes 1997</LINK>); patients with chronic asthma and concurrent fixed airway obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 1998</LINK>), patients with intrinsic asthma and those with longer duration of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Partridge-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 1981</LINK>). Patients with high serum immunoglobulin-E levels may be better treated with anticholinergic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 1998</LINK>), although earlier studies show that atopic patients respond less well to anticholinergics than those with non-atopic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jolobe-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolobe 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The possible differences in responsiveness to anticholinergics between different patient groups illustrates the heterogeneous nature of asthma. This is further compounded when taking into account the overlap of asthma and COPD. At one end of the spectrum are patients whose airflow limitation shows marked spontaneous fluctuations and improves considerably with treatment (asthma). At the other end of the spectrum are patients whose disease fluctuates to a very limited extent and is "irreversible". Whilst an improvement of greater than 15% after inhaling a short-acting ß2 -agonist indicates a degree of reversibility, any such figure is inevitably arbitrary when there is a spectrum of airway disease ranging from "reversible" to "irreversible". Clinical features such as age, nature of symptoms, atopic status and smoking history are important factors in terms of diagnosis. This blurring of the boundaries becomes important when considering anticholinergics since it is generally regarded that they may have a small but proportionately greater effect than ß2 -agonists in patients with COPD.</P>
<P>The other factor that needs to be taken into consideration is the relative safety of ß2 -agonists and anticholinergics - the former can cause an increased heart rate and have also been associated with increased bronchial activity and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Emilien-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emilien 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1992</LINK>). In comparison, the anticholinergics have relatively few side effects. Finally, anticholinergics are also used in combination with ß2 -agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1984</LINK>). In severe asthma, the main treatment is based on inhaled steroids, but the benefit : harm ratio of inhaled steroids appears to be reduced once the total daily dose exceeds 1000 mg (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1998</LINK>), with adverse effects leading to increased risk of osteoporosis, skin thinning and adrenal problems (<LINK REF="STD-van-Schayck-1995" TYPE="STUDY">van Schayck 1995</LINK>). As an alternative to high doses of inhaled steroid, moderate levels of inhaled steroid have been used in conjunction with oral steroids, leukotriene-receptor antagonists, steroid sparing alternatives, theophylline, anticholinergics or long-acting ß2 -agonists (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1998</LINK>). Oral steroids and some of the alternatives, including long-acting beta-agonists, have adverse effects too (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hougardy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hougardy 2000</LINK>), which might indicate a place for the relatively safe anticholinergics.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-09-24 14:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The objectives of this review, as defined in the original protocol ("Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults"), were to investigate the efficacy and safety of the various anticholinergic agents in chronic asthma in adults in two modes of treatment:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Anticholinergics for symptom relief (as-needed use), either alone or in combination with ß2 -agonists, in comparison with ß2 -agonists or placebo. This included both acute (short-term) bronchodilating effects and the longer-term effectiveness of bronchodilators for symptom relief.</LI>
<LI>Anticholinergics as regular, longer-term treatment, including their use as adjuncts to inhaled steroids, in comparison with ß2 -agonists (long- or short- acting) or placebo.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Protocol splitting<BR/>It was decided to split the original review in line with the two objectives because there was so much data, in an attempt to make the reviews more comprehensible. In practice there were no prn (as-needed) studies in the longer term, so that the two reviews focussed on (A) short-term bronchodilator effects (up to 24 hours) and (B) longer-term regular treatment (for periods from 2 days to 3 years). The latter focus is reported in this review and the former in the review, "Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults short term".</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials (e.g. allocation to treatment by alternation or date of birth) were analysed in the review. If a study did not report allocation details, but the allocation could have been randomised or quasi-randomised, further information was sought from the authors and the study was included if randomisation could be confirmed. Included studies reported the measurement of at least one of the outcome variables. </P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-06-30 15:38:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Adult patients with stable asthma: stability was defined as an absence of exacerbations, and stable medication prior to the study. Asthma therapy used during the study was also required to be stable.</P>
<P>The studies were required to report that the patients had asthma - preferably this was defined according to reliable criteria, such as those of the ATS, but less exactly, the patients had to display a reversibility in their lung function of at least 15% following administration of a short term ß2 -agonist (reversibility shown using anticholinergics was considered confounded and such studies were excluded).<BR/>
<BR/>Studies of patients with serious, non-respiratory diseases (e.g. cancer, heart disease) were excluded, as were those of patients with cystic fibrosis or irreversible airways disease. Studies involving a mixed group of patients having either asthma or COPD were included if separate results were given (or could be obtained from trialists) for the patients with asthma.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-24 14:36:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies were included if they used anticholinergic agents (including ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide, tiotropium bromide, atropine methonitrate and glycopyrrolate) used as a bronchodilator, in comparison with a ß2 -agonist or placebo. Delivery systems included nebulisers, metered dose inhalers and powder inhalers, with and without a spacer device.</P>
<P>Studies were included that compared:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Anticholinergics versus ß2 -agonist</LI>
<LI>Anticholinergics versus placebo</LI>
<LI>The combination of ß2 -agonist and anticholinergic versus ß2 -agonist alone</LI>
<LI>Different doses of anticholinergics</LI>
<LI>One anticholinergic versus another</LI>
</OL>
<P>Analysis was carried out only for comparisons 2 and 3 for the longer-term studies.</P>
<P>It was decided not to analyse trials that had atropine sulphate as the sole anticholinergic agent, because this has a different mode of action to the quaternary salts of atropine, has adverse effects and is therefore not routinely used as a bronchodilator in chronic asthma. Similarly, studies using non-selective ß-agonists such as isoprenaline were included, but not analysed.</P>

<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'asthma' were searched using the following terms:</P>

<P>Bibliographies from retrieved trials, meta-analyses and narrative reviews were checked to identify relevant cross-references.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-24 14:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Step I. Trials that appeared potentially relevant were identified independently by two reviewers (MW and MB) from the search citation abstracts.</P>
<P>Step II. Using the full text of each study, two reviewers (MB and MW) independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Agreement was measured using simple agreement and differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Step III. After a preliminary review of all studies to confirm the basic requirements, two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials with particular emphasis on the concealment of allocation, which was ranked using Cochrane criteria (grade A: adequate concealment; grade B: uncertain; grade C: clearly inadequate concealment). Any differences were resolved by discussion. The Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), described in the protocol, was not used for additional analysis because it and other scales are no longer thought to be the best approach to quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Step IV. Two reviewers (MB and MW) independently extracted data from the included trials and one reviewer (MW) entered results into the Cochrane Collaboration software program (Review Manager, version 4.2). These data were checked by MB. A pilot for the data extraction form was carried out on a small sample of studies and was revised appropriately. In practice this led to the use of two forms, the first stage involving details of participants, the interventions, the type of outcomes and whether variability measures (e.g. standard errors, p-values) were reported. The second form contained results if available (e.g. mean and standard deviations for continuous outcomes). In some cases, information regarding outcomes was estimated from graphs; this was performed independently by the two reviewers.</P>
<P>Data extraction included the following items:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Participants: age, gender, smoking status, type of asthma (intrinsic, extrinsic), allergic status (atopic, non-atopic), presence of co-existing COPD, severity of asthma (rated by MB based on baseline lung function, maintenance therapy and descriptions of the authors), history of asthma, symptom status at trial entry (symptomatic/asymptomatic)</LI>
<LI>Intervention: anticholinergic agent, dose, schedule, spacer device, concurrent ß2 -agonist</LI>

<P>
<BR/>STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The results for particular outcomes for each trial were combined using RevMan (Version 4.2). An intention-to-treat analysis was completed where possible. Most of the studies in this review had a crossover design, that is, the patients were given each intervention in a random order. This means that there are within-patient correlations, which, ideally, should be treated using a paired analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Where possible, this was carried out for continuous outcomes according to the guidance given by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>. The standard error for the difference of means was calculated, either from individual patient data or from p-values, and the between-period correlation parameter, &#961;, was calculated. For some studies the standard error was imputed using the lowest value of &#961; from the other studies. For parallel studies the standard error was calculated as the square root of the sum of the variances for each arm. All similar parallel and crossover studies with sufficient data were pooled using the fixed effects generic inverse variance method in RevMan Version 4.2 to give a weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.</LI>
<LI>In the absence of paired data the trials were analysed by the conventional approach of treating the two arms of the crossover as if they were from a parallel trial with separate groups (i.e. setting &#961;=0). If this was the case, parallel and crossover trials were analysed separately.</LI>
<LI>For non-paired data and continuous variables, a fixed effects weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study. All similar studies were pooled using fixed effects WMD/SMD and 95% CIs.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous variables, a fixed effects odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated for individual studies. All similar studies were pooled using fixed effects OR and 95% CIs.</LI>
<LI>For pooled effects, heterogeneity was tested using the Breslow-Day test; p &lt; 0.1 was considered statistically significant. The statistical term I<SUP>2</SUP> (which is a measure of the inconsistency among results) was also used to monitor the variability among studies.</LI>
<LI>Funnel plots were not constructed because of the paucity of included studies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>SUB-GROUP/SENSITIVITY ANALYSES:</P>
<P>If there had been sufficient studies sub-group analyses would have been carried out. <I>A-priori</I> defined subgroups were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Concurrent therapy with inhaled corticosteroid or not</LI>
<LI>Asthma severity (mild, moderate or severe)</LI>

<P>However, there was insufficient data to examine these.</P>
<P>
<B>Rationale for the presentation of studies in the review </B>
<BR/>The original review had a very large number of included studies, separated into two modes of treatment (short-term bronchodilation and longer-term regular treatment). To manage the data we used a Microsoft Access database and prioritised the comparisons to be studied. This prioritisation took place before data extraction. For the longer-term studies, the clinical question of particular interest was whether a combination of anticholinergic with ß2 -agonist would give additional symptom relief compared to that obtained with ß2 -agonist alone, so this was the main focus. It was decided to set aside the comparison anticholinergic versus ß2 -agonist because it was of little practical interest, and to look at the comparison anticholinergic versus placebo only if no difference was found between the combination and the ß2 -agonist. This would clarify whether the anticholinergic had any effect (relative to placebo) alone. In reality, two types of comparison were analysed for the longer term studies:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Anticholinergic versus placebo</LI>
<LI>Anticholinergic plus ß2 -agonist versus ß2 -agonist alone.</LI>
</OL>
<P>It was felt appropriate to separate the studies according to duration and the following definitions were provided by MB prior to data extraction: short (2 days to 2 weeks), medium (more than 2 weeks to 2 months) and long (more than 2 months).<BR/>

<P>From electronic searches conducted for the original review, a total of 623 references were identified. From the abstracts of the study reports, 210 references were marked for further scrutiny, and the remaining 413 were excluded because they clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria (for example, the patients were children or were treated for acute asthma). A further 103 possible studies were identified from other sources (e.g. references in included studies and reviews). This gave 302 possible references for which the full papers were obtained where possible. 26 reports were in non-English languages, of which 19 were translated. 239 studies were included in the original review. Of these, 45 studies had only longer-term data, 187 had only short-term data and 7 had both. The longer-term studies were all concerned with the regular addition of anticholinergics and there were no studies of longer-term as-needed use. For details of the studies that were excluded and the studies included in the short term review see the Table of Excluded Studies. Two longer-term studies were later excluded and deserve particular mention: <LINK REF="STD-Tarlo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tarlo 1982</LINK>, which is a crossover comparison of anticholinergic and placebo over 90 days was excluded because the patients were instructed to reduce gradually their dose of bronchodilators - thus their concurrent medication was not stable, which we considered to be confounding. Secondly, <LINK REF="STD-Brand-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brand 1992</LINK> (and its 7 accompanying papers) was a large parallel 3 year comparison of the combination of ipratropium bromide and terbutaline versus terbutaline alone. Unfortunately the study did not report separate results for asthma, although these were recorded, and contact with the authors has failed to produce any data. Four other studies did not state if the patients were randomised to treatments, and no further information was obtained from the authors. This left 39 reports of randomised or quasi randomised trials. Of these 39 longer-term study reports, 9 were additional reports of trials already reported, leaving 30 trials.</P>
<P>The 30 longer-term trials sometimes included more than two randomised interventions, giving rise to more than one comparison per trial; thus 23 trials had one comparison, 6 two comparisons and 1 trial had 3 comparisons. The number of trials reporting the different comparisons was:<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>For the anticholinergic-placebo comparisons, there were three main variables with respect to the anticholinergic. The anticholinergic drugs included ipratropium bromide (7 studies), oxitropium bromide (8), nebulised atropine methonitrate (1) and inhaled atropine sulphate (<LINK REF="STD-Light-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Light 1977</LINK>). The latter study was not analysed. The dose of ipratropium bromide ranged from 40 µg to 200 µg delivered either by metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler. The frequency of administration ranged from twice daily to five times daily. For further details see table of included studies.</P>
<P>All of the studies comparing a combination of ß2 -agonist plus anticholinergic versus ß2 -agonist alone used ipratropium bromide as the anticholinergic agent at either 40 or 80 µg, three or four times per day. In all studies the ß2 -agonist was short acting. In eight studies fenoterol was combined with ipratropium as Duovent (40 µg ipratropium, 100 µg fenoterol), Berodual (20 µg ipratropium, 50 µg fenoterol) or using two separate inhalers. In the ß2 comparison arm, three studies used fenoterol and the remaining studies used salbutamol. Three further studies used terbutaline as the ß2 -agonist, both in combination and as the comparator. However one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>) used oral controlled-release tablets and this study was analysed separately because of the different pharmacokinetics of the oral formulation. For further details see table of included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Outcome measures chosen were those generally accepted to reflect the primary outcome of asthma control. Daytime and night time asthma symptom scores were derived from daily diaries. Objective measurements of lung function were daily peak flow measurements, recorded morning and evening, before and after use of inhaler. Additional outcomes were treatment related withdrawal from the study, patient preference, bronchodilator use as rescue medication (number of patients requiring this), number of patients with exacerbations and adverse effects. Clinical and physiological assessments at the beginning and end of each trial period were regarded as being less valuable, given the recognised spontaneous fluctuations which can occur in asthma.</P>

<P>The methodological quality was poorly reported in all 22 studies, but the authors provided further details for five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vaughan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughan 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK>). All but one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK>) still did not give an adequate description of allocation concealment, with only partial details provided (for example using sealed envelopes). One additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Light-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Light 1977</LINK>) reported an inadequate method of allocation concealment. Generally the reporting of blinding was vague, with all but two being described as double blind or blind (1 study). The Philip-Joet study stated that it did not have a double blind design and the comparison we used for the Salorinne study (inhaled Ipratropium bromide versus powder placebo) could not have been blinded. The Macaluso study, despite stating it was double blinded, was not blinded because the combination arm used three inhalations and the ß2 -agonist four. The Pavia study reported that some patients could distinguish by taste oxitropium bromide from placebo, and it is likely that the blinding was broken in some of the other placebo studies too. This may also be true of the combination comparison, because ipratropium bromide and salbutamol, for instance, taste quite different. Nine of the 22 studies had intention to treat analyses carried out and for two other studies it was unclear what was done. Six studies (Haahtela, Philip-Joet, Tammivaara, Wolstenholme, Ruffin and Wheeler) had at least 20% of the patients' results missing for some outcomes, and nearly 40% of the patients were not analysed for the 8-week PEF outcome in the Philip-Joet study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration</HEADING>
<P>Although the original intention was to separate the study durations as described in the methods section, in practice there were too few studies to make this feasible, so all durations were considered together.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">A) Anticholinergic versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>There were 13 studies comparing anticholinergic with placebo. Of these, one was not included in our analysis because it used atropine sulphate (<LINK REF="STD-Light-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Light 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven studies were also not included in the initial analysis: 6 studies did not record means for the continuous outcomes and 1 other study did not report standard deviations or p-values. The authors of these studies were contacted and Boehringer Ingelheim provided individual patient data for <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>; some other authors offered data, but to date these had not arrived. Thus, there were only 4 studies that provided sufficient data for analysis of the continuous outcomes, although 7 studies gave data for the dichotomous outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK> compared two doses of anticholinergic and, in order to clarify the main analysis, we decided to choose one dose of ipratropium bromide, based on the head-to-head comparison. It was found that for both symptom scores and peak flow measurements the summary statistics were in favour of the lower dose (40µg), although none was statistically significant (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and forest plots). Therefore for this study the lower dose was used in comparison with placebo in the main analyses.</P>
<P>The results for various outcomes for the comparison of anticholinergic with placebo are summarised in additional tables 2-5. Where there was more than one similar study, the results were combined and the summary statistics reported in the additional table and shown in a forest plot. Otherwise the results in the table are for single studies.</P>
<P>For some outcomes, the percentage increase or decrease over placebo was calculated. This is an approximation used to give an estimate of the magnitude of the effect in clinical terms. It was done using as denominator the simple average, over the individual studies, of the placebo means; the numerator was the weighted mean difference from the meta-analysis (or single study). It should be noted that the studies involved had a range of asthma severities, so that patients with more severe disease might derive greater benefit than represented by the mean percentage change, but there is insufficient information to look at subgroups, either for peak flows or symptom scores.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Symptom scores </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)<BR/>The data were analysed by calculating the difference in means and the paired difference standard error and pooling the data, where appropriate, using the generic inverse variance method. The Wheeler study gave individual patient data (IPD) and the Ahonen study reported p-values for the comparison. The scales for the studies were different (<LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK>: 1-4; <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK>: 0-3 and <LINK REF="STD-Taytard-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Taytard 1984</LINK> 0-13), but the first two scales were linearly equivalent and so could be combined in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Taytard-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Taytard 1984</LINK> was analysed separately because the trialists reported a combined 'clinical score', which was a composite of day-time and night-time symptom scores and drug consumption for symptomatic relief. For this study, only first period results were used (because the authors reported an order effect); the study reported individual patient data and because of large baseline differences, the change scores were used.</P>
<P>The four studies had treatment periods ranging from 4 days to 4 weeks and it was decided to combine these different durations, by calculating the mean symptom score per day.</P>
<P>It should be noted that <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK> (which provided individual patient data) had a number of patients who failed to report their scores every day, so we calculated symptom scores based only on the patients who completed their diary cards for more than 20 days (28/30 patients). The study reported symptom scores over the whole period for each patient, so we calculated their daily symptom score (for the number of days they reported), and then took the mean for all patients included. <LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK> reported placebo values averaged over two placebo arms.</P>
<P>The night-time symptom scores could not be combined because the Ahonen study measured only dyspnoea and the Wheeler study gave an overall measure of cough, breathlessness and wheeze; <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> gave no standard deviations, although it measured cough and dyspnoea separately. Thus there was only one symptom score outcome for which data could be pooled - daytime dyspnoea. In order to use the generic inverse variance method, we calculated the interaction parameter, &#961;, for the Wheeler study (&#961;=0.817) and used this in the Ahonen study to impute the standard error. <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> gave no standard deviations so for each arm we used the mean of the standard deviations from <LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK> and then calculated the standard error for the difference using the Wheeler value of &#961;. Although not ideal, we feel that this gives the best representation of the data. This approximation for the <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> was examined by a sensitivity analysis and it was found that the addition of the <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> made little difference to the summary statistics.</P>
<P>The results are summarised in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>
<BR/>Daytime dyspnoea: the summary statistics were: WMD -0.09 (95%CI -0.14, -0.04, 3 studies, 59 patients), i.e. the anticholinergic agent gave more favourable symptom scores than the placebo, and the result was statistically significant. There was little heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%, p =0.45). This corresponds to a 15% decrease in symptom score over placebo. The other symptom scores could not be pooled and only the Taytard study gave a statistically significant result on its own - which was in favour of the anticholinergic agent. Otherwise the results of single studies indicated that, relative to placebo, the anticholinergic showed some improvement in daytime cough and night-time dyspnoea, but some worsening in night-time cough.</P>
<P>In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Kreisman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kreisman 1981</LINK> reported that patients coughed more on the ipratropium regimes. <LINK REF="STD-Tormey-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tormey 1995</LINK> reported that there were no significant differences in symptom scores (unspecified) between placebo and oxitropium bromide over 28 days; and <LINK REF="STD-Vaughan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughan 1988</LINK> reported that 'total symptom scores' (cough and wheeze) were no different when using nebulised atropine methonitrate compared with placebo over 2 weeks.</P>
<P>
<B>2. PEF measurements </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>)<B>
<BR/>
</B>Four studies reported daily peak flow measurements, but one of these gave no p-values or standard deviations; the Ahonen and Salorinne studies reported some p-values, and IPD were given for the <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>. &#961; values for this study (although not used) were respectively 0.919 and 0.911 for the am and pm peak flows. The outcomes were daily peak flow rates measured before and after the bronchodilator dose.</P>
<P>Summary statistics were calculated using the generic inverse variance method. The Ahonen study gave an upper bound for the p-value for the ipratropium-placebo comparison, which allowed calculation of the standard error for the mean of the difference (AC - placebo). The Salorinne study gave an upper bound for the p-value for the evening PEF, but for the morning value the standard deviation for the Wheeler study was taken and the standard error calculated from this (<LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK> was not used for this purpose because of a discrepancy between the graph and table values).</P>
<P>The following results were found:<BR/>a) Morning PEF<BR/>The PEF daily average weighted mean difference (WMD) was:<BR/>WMD =14.38 litres/min (95%CI 7.69, 21.08; 3 studies, 59 patients) i.e., statistically significantly higher for the anticholinergic; this showed some heterogeneity (p = 0.22, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%) and corresponds to an increase of about 7% over placebo. We tested the assumptions for <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> using a sensitivity analysis, and found that the heterogeneity was removed (p=0.65, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), but there was little effect on the WMD (16.26 L/min; 95%CI 9.21, 23.31).<BR/>Post-bronchodilator morning PEF measurements were available for 2 studies, and were taken 2 and 3h after the dose. The WMD was 34.91 litres/minute (95%CI 20.13, 49.70, 2 studies, 31 patients), a statistically significant difference, corresponding to an increase of 9% over placebo.</P>
<P>b) Evening PEF<BR/>The evening (about 10 pm) PEF daily average WMD was: 23.48 L/m (95%CI 12.32, 34.65, 3 studies, 60 patients) i.e., statistically significantly larger peak flow rate for the anticholinergic, but there was heterogeneity (p=0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP>=78%). The WMD represents an 7% increase over placebo.<BR/>Post-bronchodilator evening PEF measurements were available only for <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK>: WMD 23.94 L/m (95%CI 5.20, 42.68, 1 study, 18 patients), giving a statistically significant increase of 7%.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Vaughan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughan 1988</LINK> used nebulised atropine methonitrate over 2 weeks, and reported that the peak flow measurements were not different between placebo and Atropine methonitrate either in the morning or at 5pm.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Use of rescue medication</B> (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>)<BR/>Three studies reported that they recorded the use of rescue medication, but relative numbers of patients were given only in the <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Taytard-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Taytard 1984</LINK> (3 weeks) reported that the 'mean consumption of salbutamol was essentially identical for placebo and oxitropium bromide' and <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> (1 week) reported that 'the number of additional treatments did not differ between the various treatments'. For the <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK> (4 weeks) 23 of 30 patients taking oxitropium and 25/30 taking placebo required rescue medication during the day (OR 0.66 ; 95%CI 0.18, 2.36 - not statistically significant) and the corresponding night time ratios were 15/30 and 19/30 (OR 0.58 ;95%CI 0.21, 1.62).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>4. Patient preference </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>)<B>
<BR/>
</B>The number of patients preferring anticholinergic was compared with the number preferring placebo in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wheeler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeler 1987</LINK>) - in the latter case , some patients did not have a preference. In the former study patients chose between 40 µg, 200 µg (inhaled) and 200 µg powder ipratropium bromide as well as placebo (which was a powder); the odds ratio for patient preference was: OR 1.64 (95%CI 0.68, 3.94) i.e. non-significantly in favour of the anticholinergic, with little heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Drug-related withdrawal </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>)<BR/>Two studies gave data on the number of asthma patients withdrawing while taking one of the study drugs. The pooled odds ratio was 0.70 (95%CI 0.13, 3.72) - non significantly in favour of anticholinergic, with some heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Adverse effects </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>)<BR/>Six studies gave some information on adverse effects, but of these <LINK REF="STD-Kreisman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kreisman 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bellia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bellia 1988</LINK> only gave a descriptive account, and <LINK REF="STD-Ahonen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ahonen 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Salorinne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Salorinne 1988</LINK> reported the number of effects or symptom scores, rather than the number of patients with those effects. <LINK REF="STD-Kreisman-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kreisman 1981</LINK> stated that the side effects were equally reported, and <LINK REF="STD-Bellia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bellia 1988</LINK> reported that no significant side effects were recorded for oxitropium bromide. For the studies that gave numerical data, individual side effects (e.g. mouth dryness) gave similar results for anticholinergic and placebo, with no statistically significant differences observed at the lower doses used, and for overall side effects, the pooled odds ratio was OR 1.87 (95%CI 0.51, 6.81) - not statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">B) Combination of anticholinergic and ß2 -agonist versus ß2 -agonist alone</HEADING>
<P>There were 9 trials comparing the combination of anticholinergic and ß2<SUP> -</SUP>agonist with ß2 -agonist alone. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>) used oral CR terbutaline as the ß2 -agonist and we analysed this study separately because of the different pharmacokinetics. One study could not be analysed because it did not give any results and 2 studies did not report standard deviations or P-values. The authors of these studies were contacted and some offered data, but to date these had not arrived. Additional information, was however provided by <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK>. This left only six studies that provided sufficient data for analysis of the continuous outcomes, and six studies gave data for the dichotomous outcomes. For all studies the final values of the outcome measures were used, rather than adopting change scores.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK>, the peak flows and symptom scores were reported as a daily average for weeks 1-4 and, separately, 9-12 weeks; we used the mean of 1-4 and 9-12 weeks as a measure of the response. <LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK> reported the weekly mean peak flows and standard deviations for weeks 1 to 8. However, many patients dropped out (48/196 overall) and the PEF results showed such a large number of missing patients (e.g., at 8 weeks, 37 of 101 from the combination arm and 40 of 95 from the ß2 -agonist arm) that we decided to include only the results for the first week as being the least confounded (still 11/101 and 12/95 missing).</P>
<P>Unlike the anticholinergic-placebo comparison, these studies differed from one another in various important ways, making pooling questionable. Firstly, there were differences in study duration, but we decided it was reasonable to combine all durations.</P>
<P>Secondly, there was a mixture of study designs, 2 parallel and 7 crossover trials. It was not possible to analyse the crossover studies using the generic inverse variance method because none reported IPD or P-values, and consequently we had to analyse the crossover studies as if they were parallel studies, which meant that the crossover and (true) parallel studies could not be combined in an analysis.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the ß2 -agonist in the two arms differed in both composition and dose. We decided to treat all the ß2 -agonists as having the same equivalence and recorded the difference in doses in a single variable, the ratio of ß2 -agonist in the combination arm to that in the single arm. Two ratios were analysed 1:1 and 1:2 - the latter can be considered as the <I>substitution</I> of anticholinergic for some of the ß2 -agonist in the single arm and the former as the <I>addition </I>of anticholinergic to the same level of ß2 -agonist. Thus the breakdown of studies is:<BR/>

Symptom scores </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>)<BR/>Daily symptom scores were measured in six studies and all used a scale of 0-3. <LINK REF="STD-Mazzei-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzei 1985</LINK> only reported symptom scores at a clinic visit, not daily (thus not meeting our criteria). No results were reported for 2 studies and no standard deviations were given for one. <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> reported graphically a distribution of symptom scores, but the exact nature of the representation was unclear; despite these uncertainties, we calculated a mean symptom score and standard deviation from these data. Of the remaining studies, one reported the weekly symptom scores and two reported daily scores: the former values were adjusted to daily scores.<BR/>The only possible studies that were sufficiently similar to be combined were <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK>, but in view of the uncertainties about the <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> symptom score data, we decided to analyse these as single studies.</P>
<P>Generally there is no evidence, from the single studies analysed, for a significant difference in any symptom score between the combination and the single arm, regardless of the trial design, time duration or ratio of ß2 -agonist.<BR/>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK> also stated that, for all symptom score measurements, there were no significant differences among any of the 4 regimens, even when the subgroup of more severe patients was analysed. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> stated that there was a statistically significant difference in favour of Duovent for daytime dyspnoea, but our analysis of their available data did not confirm this. The Pierce study stated that 'symptom score cards (measuring daytime and nocturnal dyspnoea, wheeze and cough) failed to reveal any significant differences between the combination and either drug alone'. <LINK REF="STD-Waite-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Waite 1987</LINK> stated that 'symptom scores recorded in the morning and evening for wheeze, cough and restrictions in activity showed no significant differences between the two treatments'.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Lung function measurements </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>)<BR/>Daily peak flow measurements were measured in 5 studies. An additional study, <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1982</LINK> measured daily mean flow using an airflowmeter so this study was analysed separately. <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1983</LINK> reported no data (but stated that there was a similar improvement for each arm) and <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK> gave no standard deviations for the daily peak flow measurement.</P>
<P>The different characteristics of the studies (parallel/crossover, PEF/flow and oral/inhaled beta-agonist) meant that no studies were sufficiently similar to be combined. However, the general trend is that there is very little difference between interventions with no single study achieving statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK> also reported that 'analysis did not reveal any significant differences, even when the subgroup of more severe patients was analysed'.<BR/>Post-bronchodilator measurements were made for three studies and were taken after 20m, 30m and 1h. There was little difference between the interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Patient preference </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>)<BR/>Only two crossover studies reported the preference of the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK>), but the former used oral beta-agonist. In <LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK> the patients preferred the combination, but in <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK> the reverse was the case; neither study showed statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1983</LINK> reported no significant difference in patient preference. <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> reported that the 'patient's opinion was more favourable with Duovent than salbutamol', but this may have been because the patients received respectively 3 and 4 administrations of the test drug.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Drug-related withdrawal </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>)<BR/>Four studies reported the number of patients withdrawing while taking one of the study drugs, but only 2 studies could be combined. The pooled odds ratio for the parallel study substitutional-anticholinergic was: 1.40 (95%CI 0.69, 2.84, 2, studies, using the Berodual-salbutamol comparison in <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK>, 161 patients), i.e. in favour of the ß2 -agonist, but not statistically significant and with some heterogeneity (p=0.22, I<SUP>2</SUP>=32%).<BR/>Overall, there were fewer withdrawals from the ß2 -agonist arm, regardless of the time duration, ratio of ß2 -agonist levels and trial design, but no result was statistically significant. The exception was the oral beta-agonist crossover study, <LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>, which showed fewer withdrawals for the combination (not statistically significant).</P>
<P>
<B>5. Number of patients with exacerbations </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>)<BR/>Two studies reported the number of patients with exacerbations (or worsening), <LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>, the former shows fewer patients with exacerbations for the ß2 -agonist arm and the latter shows the reverse, neither is statistically significant, and the results have not been combined because of the use of the oral ß2 -agonist in <LINK REF="STD-Tammivaara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tammivaara 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Adverse effects </B>(<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>)<BR/>Six studies gave some information on adverse effects, but of these <LINK REF="STD-Haahtela-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haahtela 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mazzei-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzei 1985</LINK> reported the number of effects or symptom scores, rather than the number of patients with those effects and <LINK REF="STD-Philip_x002d_Joet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Philip-Joet 1990</LINK> had too much missing data to be included without confounding. Two studies gave a descriptive account only: <LINK REF="STD-Wolstenholme-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wolstenholme 1989</LINK> stated that there was no difference in side effects reported for the two periods and <LINK REF="STD-Macaluso-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Macaluso 1986</LINK> found that side effects (tremor, palpitations and tachycardia) occurred in negligible percentages for both treatments. The remaining studies were not pooled because they had different ratios of ß2 -agonist and different designs (see additional table 9). Generally, there is little evidence for a difference in adverse effects between the combination and single arm ß2 -agonist, and no result is statistically significant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-24 14:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>As a chronic disease, with no known cure, the accepted goals of management in chronic asthma are to minimise the adverse impact of the disease on the patient's physical and mental well-being, to prevent long term damage with fixed airflow obstruction and to reduce mortality. In the majority of patients treatment is therefore directed at improving physiological end-points and patient-perceived physical and mental health. Although anticholinergics are frequently used in patients with more severe forms of asthma, the evidence justifying its use remains limited. Both short-term and long-term anticholinergics are of some benefit in patients with COPD, their role in asthma is less clearly defined. The recent BTS guidelines include anticholinergics as one of the options for short term bronchodilator relief at Step 1, and in the management of acute severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2004</LINK>). They receive no mention as regular add-on treatment for use in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting ß2 -agonists.</P>
<P>The acute bronchodilator effect of an anticholinergic is usually demonstrated by making physiological measurements before and after inhaling the drug. The most commonly used measurements include the FEV1 and vital capacity, although other end-points such as the ability to modify bronchial challenge tests have also been widely studied. It is on this basis that anticholinergics are sometimes used to relieve symptoms although the majority of acute studies do not include symptom scores as part of their evaluation.</P>
<P>This review was specifically directed at examining the role of anticholinergics used on a regular basis, especially when used as an adjunct to a ß2 -agonist. The comparison between a regular anticholinergic and placebo is of limited clinical relevance but was undertaken to determine whether there was a detectable subjective or objective improvement. Despite the limited number of studies, anticholinergic agents resulted in more favourable symptom scores particularly in respect of daytime dyspnoea. Daily peak flow measurements also showed a statistically significant improvement for the anticholinergic. However, the clinical significance is small and in terms of peak flow measurements equates to approximately a 7% increase over placebo. Secondary outcome measures such as use of rescue medication, patient preference and drug-related withdrawals showed no significant differences although these conclusions were based on very limited objective data. The same reservations applied to adverse effects where again there was no evidence for a systematic difference between anticholinergic and placebo.</P>
<P>The second part of the review is more clinically relevant and addresses the question as to whether a combination of anticholinergic plus ß2 -agonist confers significant advantage when compared with ß2 -agonist alone. There was no evidence in respect of primary outcome measures, symptom scores or peak flow rates of any significant differences between the two regimes. Similarly, there were no significant benefits shown in respect of secondary outcome measures. There are however major reservations with respect to the quality of the information from which these conclusions are drawn. The total number of studies suitable for analysis was small and involved limited numbers of patients. A number of studies were excluded from analysis because of methodological flaws, incomplete data or because they included patients with COPD. Even for those studies included, differences in methodology meant that they could not easily be combined. The main differences which might affect analysis have already been identified but merit re-iteration.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patient characteristics</HEADING>
<P>All the included studies define the patients as having asthma or reversible airflow obstruction. A 15% improvement of FEV1 after an inhaled ß2 -agonist was the most frequently used physiological test although some studies included spontaneous variability. Criteria as defined by the American Thoracic Society were used in a significant number of studies. Patient characteristics varied considerably both between and within studies. There was a wide range of patient age, variable numbers of atopic patients and variable numbers of smokers with symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Despite this heterogeneity, it seems likely that most studies focused on patients at the more reversible end of the spectrum of airway disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Severity of the disease</HEADING>
<P>Again there was considerable heterogeneity both between and within studies with patients ranging from having mild to severe asthma. Defining criteria were often not stated. Factors taken into consideration in trying to assess the severity of the disease included patient symptoms, baseline lung function and maintenance treatment. In addition, studies were only included if the asthma was regarded as being "stable". It is theoretically possible that patients with more severe disease might derive greater symptomatic benefit from small improvements in lung function. There were insufficient data to provide sub-group analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Maintenance treatment</HEADING>
<P>Once again there were significant variations both between and within studies. These ranged from low maintenance treatment to patients who were on regular treatment with theophylline, inhaled or oral steroids. Additional ß2 -agonists used as rescue treatment were included in a number of studies and used as a secondary outcome measure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological differences: different drug combinations</HEADING>
<P>There were significant differences between studies with respect to the different drug regimes studied. These included a variety of anticholinergics using different doses. The ß2 -agonist used also varied and in some studies the comparator ß2 -agonist was different from that used in the combination.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological differences: outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Although diary cards were used in a number of studies, data was often incomplete and the scoring system varied. Studies using regular peak flow measurements were similar although the timing of the measurements with respect to the preceding dose may have influenced the outcome measurement.</P>
<P>The failure to demonstrate any subjective or objective improvement by the addition of anticholinergic to a regular ß2 -agonist may have various explanations which merit further consideration. As indicated, it may simply be that the studies are insufficiently powered to detect what may be small but significant differences. Patient selection is also likely to be critically important. Patients with mild disease will have little potential for further improvement over and above that achieved by inhaled steroids and ß2 -agonists. Conversely, patients with more intractable disease may well have airway obstruction with only limited reversibility. There were insufficient data to permit subgroup analyses, looking specifically at defined patient groups.</P>
<P>None of the studies specifically identified those patients whose asthma was inadequately controlled despite being on regular ß2 -agonists and inhaled steroids. In part this reflects the fact that the studies analysed have been undertaken over the past 20 years and guidelines have evolved during this period.</P>
<P>Overall this review provides no justification for routinely introducing anticholinergics as part of add-on treatment for patients whose asthma is not well controlled on standard therapies. This does not exclude the possibility that there may be a sub-group of patients who derive some benefit and a trial of treatment in individual patients may still be justified. The review does highlight the need for studies of sufficient power using standardised criteria and methodology in order to answer specific questions. It is unlikely that such studies will be undertaken using the currently available short term anticholinergics. The role of long term anticholinergics such as tiotropium bromide has yet to be established in patients with asthma and any future trials might draw on the messages derived from this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Inhaled anticholinergics have a bronchodilator effect in patients with asthma. In clinical and physiological terms this effect is small. The addition of anticholinergics to regular inhaled bronchodilators has not been shown to confer significant benefits, so the current evidence does not justify their routine use. The study does not exclude the fact that there may be sub-groups of patients who derive some symptomatic benefit. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future studies need to be sufficiently powered to answer specific questions, which need to be clearly formulated. The role of long term anticholinergics in the management of asthma is a potential case in point. Patient characteristics need to be clearly defined and particular focus directed at those patients with more severe disease that is inadequately controlled on a combination of inhaled steroids and long acting ß2 -agonists. In addition, outcome measures need to be standardised and to include patient-derived symptom scores and quality of life data in addition to physiological measurements.</P>
