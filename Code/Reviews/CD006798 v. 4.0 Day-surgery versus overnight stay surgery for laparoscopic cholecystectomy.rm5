<P>This review compares same-day discharge (day-surgery) with overnight stay after keyhole removal of the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) for various conditions affecting the gallbladder but mainly for gallstones causing pain. </P>
<P>Stones that develop in the gallbladder can cause pain in the upper abdomen. This condition is treated by surgical removal of the gallbladder through keyhole surgery, a procedure that is known as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This procedure may involve the person staying in hospital overnight, but increasingly it is possible to perform the operation and allow them to go home on the same day ('day-surgery'). There is some controversy over whether performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy as day-surgery is safe.</P>
<P>This review aims to investigate the current literature available and provides an overview of the evidence demonstrated in recent clinical trials on the subject. The review authors identified a total of six trials involving 492 participants. Two hundred and thirty-nine people underwent planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy as day-surgery and 253 participants stayed in the hospital overnight after the procedure. All the trials were at high risk of bias (methodological deficiencies that might make it possible to arrive at wrong conclusions by overestimating the benefit or underestimating the harm of the day-surgery or overnight stay procedure). We looked at outcomes that are considered to be important from the perspective of the participant and also the healthcare provider. These outcomes include death, serious complication, quality of life following procedure, pain, how long it took for people to return to normal activity and to return to work, hospital readmissions, and failed discharges (failure to be discharged as planned). There was no significant difference in the proportion who died or the complication rate between the group who underwent day-surgery and those who stayed overnight. Quality of life did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the time taken for people to return to normal activity or to return to work. There was also no significant difference in the hospital readmission or failed discharge rates. The results suggest that day-surgery is safe for patients. It is important to note that all trials were at risk of bias and the data were sparse, resulting in a considerable chance of arriving at wrong conclusions due to systematic errors (overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of day-surgery or overnight stay) and random errors (play of chance). More randomised trials are needed to investigate the impact of day-surgery and overnight stay on the quality of life and other outcomes of people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-05 12:36:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi  S Gurusamy">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and<I> </I>the<I> </I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and mRCT until September 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:00:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included randomised clinical trials comparing day-surgery versus overnight stay surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, irrespective of language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:00:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat or available case analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 11:14:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We identified a total of six trials at high risk of bias involving 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 253) for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150. The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%. The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years.</P>
<P>With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-term mortality. However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups. We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short-term mortality in the remaining trials. Long-term mortality was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day-surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). There was no significant difference in quality of life between the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the secondary outcomes of our review: pain (3 trials; 175 participants; MD 0.02 cm visual analogue scale score; 95% CI -0.69 to 0.73); time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; MD -0.55 days; 95% CI -2.18 to 1.08); and return to work (1 trial, 74 participants; MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -10.34 to 6.34). No significant difference was seen in hospital readmission rate (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 (weighted rate 0.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/239 (2.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group (rate ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63) or in the proportion of people requiring hospital readmissions (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (weighted proportion 3.5%) in the day-surgery group versus 5/154 (3.2%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60). No significant difference was seen in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the two groups (5 trials; 419 participants; 42/205 (weighted proportion 19.3%) in the day-surgery group versus 43/214 (20.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41). For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required information size to exclude random errors.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 09:34:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi  S Gurusamy">
<P>Day-surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Day-surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The randomised clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the quality of life as well as other outcomes of patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:33:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:00:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00f8_rgensen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jørgensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muhrbeck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhrbeck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year with an acute inflammation of the gallbladder due to obstruction, a condition known as acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>).The gold standard management of symptomatic gallstones is removal of the gallbladder, a procedure known as a cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>In the United States, 1.5 million cholecystectomies are performed annually. In the United Kingdom, approximately 50,000 cholecystectomies are performed annually and the majority of these are performed laparoscopically. Currently, approximately 16,500 of cholecystectomies in the United Kingdom are performed as day-surgery procedures (<LINK REF="REF-HES-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2012</LINK>), with people being discharged the same day as the operation. While it is obvious that performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy can result in cost savings, concerns exist regarding the safety of the patient. The main serious adverse events associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy are bleeding and bile duct injury (<LINK REF="STD-Keulemans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Keulemans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shamiyeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shamiyeh 2004</LINK>). The main concern is whether performing day-surgery can have a negative impact on people because of these serious adverse events because of late recognition of complications. There are also concerns about the adequacy of post-operative pain control at home.</P>

Risk of bias domains were classified as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation sequence generation </HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent research assistant not otherwise involved in the trial.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not random.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the participant allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment. Allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit. The allocation sequence was unknown to the investigators (eg, if the allocation sequence was hidden in sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes).</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the allocation sequence was likely to be known to the investigators who assigned the participants.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the assessment of outcomes was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether blinding was likely to introduce bias into the results.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the assessment of outcomes was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is impossible to blind the participants as to whether they received day-surgery or overnight stay surgery. We rated all the subjective outcomes as being at high risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessors</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there is insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used is likely to introduce bias into the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. Sufficient methods, such as multiple imputation, have been employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to introduce bias into the results.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the results were likely to be biased due to missing data.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: all outcomes were pre-defined (for example, in a published protocol) and reported, or all clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes (mortality and serious adverse events) were reported.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: it is unclear whether all pre-defined and clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported, and data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vested Interest</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the trial appears to be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. </LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias, eg, for-profit involvement, authors have conducted trials on the same topic etc.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:02:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We reported the risk difference if this was different from the risk ratio (ie, if the risk difference was statistically significant and the risk ratio was not statistically significant, and vice versa). Risk difference takes the 'zero event trials' into account while the risk ratio does not. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI. For count data such as serious adverse events, we reported the rate ratio with a 95% CI.</P>

If the trial sequential monitoring boundary or the required information size is reached or the futility zone is crossed, then more trials may not be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the required sample size from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, the variance estimated from the meta-analysis results of trials with low risk of bias, and a minimal clinically relevant difference of one cm for pain on a visual analogue scale and one day for time to return to activity and planned to calculate the required sample size for time to return to work on the same basis as time to return to activity. </P>

<P>One trial reported short-term mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK>). However, there were no deaths in this trial. Even in the other trials, although short-term mortality was not reported explicitly, from the type of adverse events that participants suffered, and based on the number of participants included in the other outcomes, we could infer that there was no short-term mortality in either group. Since there was no mortality in either group, we were unable to use the control group proportion for the calculation of the required information size of the trial sequential analysis. Instead, we used a proportion of 0.2% in the control group based on data from approximately 30,000 patients included in a database in Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2011</LINK>). The proportion of information accrued was only 0.14% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn by the program (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had failed discharge between the two groups (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). The trial sequential analysis revealed that the proportion of information accrued was only 2.62% of the diversity-adjusted required information size, and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Keulemans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Keulemans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollington-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollington 1999</LINK>), the standard deviation was calculated from the standard error. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Barthelsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelsson 2008</LINK>, the standard deviation, the standard error, and the P value were not given, and we used the highest standard deviation in the outcome. Removing the imputed data from each outcome did not cause a change in the results (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five of the six trials included in this systematic review had post-randomisation drop-outs (<LINK REF="STD-Keulemans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Keulemans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollington-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollington 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barthelsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelsson 2008</LINK>). In these groups, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the three binary outcomes (short-term mortality, number of people requiring hospital readmission, and failed discharge), to investigate best and worst outcomes. It was not possible to impute best and worst scenarios for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK>) as the trial failed to detail the groups to which post-randomisation drop-outs belonged. For this reason we did not perform a sensitivity analysis on short-term mortality, as <LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK> was the only trial that reported short-term mortality explicitly. With regards to the number of people requiring hospital readmission, the 'best-best' scenario results showed no change compared with the original analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). However, when the outcomes were imputed by the 'worst-worst' and 'worst-best' scenarios, the results significantly favoured overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In contrast, imputation of outcome according to the 'best-worst' scenario significantly favoured day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). With regards to the number of failed discharge attempts, the imputation of outcomes by the 'best-best', 'worst-worst', 'best-worst', and 'worst-best' scenarios showed no significant change in the results obtained without imputation (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:21:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:21:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There were no statistically significant differences in any of the outcomes between day-surgery and overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was no significant difference in short-term mortality between the groups of participants undergoing day-surgery or overnight-stay elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Only one trial reported short-term mortality explicitly. However, the serious adverse events and the number of participants included in the remaining trials suggest that there was no mortality in the remaining trials. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered a low-morbidity procedure. Long-term mortality was not reported. However, it is unlikely that long-term mortality is affected by the decision to admit the patient overnight provided that there was no difference in the short-term mortality (which was the case in this particular comparison). There was no significant difference in serious adverse events or quality of life between the two groups. There was a suggestion of heterogeneity between the trials with regards to quality of life by the I². Two trials favoured day-surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2006</LINK>) and two trials favoured overnight-stay surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Keulemans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Keulemans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barthelsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelsson 2008</LINK>). However, there was significant overlap of confidence intervals and the Chi² test for heterogeneity was not significant. Quality of life is difficult to quantify, and trials report it in markedly different ways. This could be the reason for the heterogeneity noted between the trials.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in pain, time to return to activity, time to return to work, number of hospital readmissions, number of people requiring hospital readmission, and failed discharge. Inadequate pain control at home or excessive complications because of early discharge would have resulted in an increase in one or more of the above. Considering that none of the above have been affected, it appears that there are no significant differences between day-surgery and overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, there is still a possibility that these findings are because of lack of evidence of effect and not because of lack of effect. Furthermore, all trials were considered at risk of bias, that is overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms of day-surgery or overnight stay. That is why more randomised clinical trials are necessary.</P>
<P>Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a low-morbidity procedure. Major complications are likely to be noted at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and those with such major complications during operation will not be discharged as day-surgery patients even if they were admitted to the hospital with an intention to perform the surgery as day-surgery. The only concern about discharging the people on the same day is that post-operative complications can be missed. The issue is whether these post-operative complications would have been identified if the patient had stayed overnight. Many post-operative complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy manifest with abdominal pain and so appropriate advice should be given to people to ensure that they return to the hospital if they have abdominal pain uncontrolled by routine analgesia. They should also be advised to return in the presence of dizziness or light headedness (particularly if postural), or exercise intolerance, as these may be early signs of significant bleeding. However, it must be noted that the impact of discharging people on the same day on these rare complications which are not evident within the first four to eight hours of observation in hospital cannot be assessed in randomised clinical trials because of the rare nature of the complications. On the other hand, inadequate pain control can affect the patients' quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work. Future trials should be powered to measure differences in these outcomes.</P>
<P>We identified four studies that were non-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curet-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Curet 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>). These do not report any specific adverse events related to day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>Because of the shorter hospital stay, day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy is likely to result in lower costs, which will benefit those paying for their surgery and the government in a state-funded healthcare system.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 11:07:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review included participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the predominant management choice for symptomatic gallstones. Four trials clearly stated that the patients underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="STD-Keulemans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Keulemans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dirksen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dirksen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barthelsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelsson 2008</LINK>). The indication for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not stated in the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hollington-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollington 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2001</LINK>). However, the findings of this review can be applied to patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder polyps and gallbladder dyskinesia since there is no scientific rationale for an interaction between the timing of discharge and the indication for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Hence this review is applicable to most people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the safety of day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis on a non-elective basis has not been established and should be investigated further. This review also includes mostly patients at low anaesthetic risk and is applicable only for such people.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-29 11:08:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>All the trials were at a high risk of bias. Blinding of participants, healthcare providers, assessors, and investigators was not reported in any trial. Some trials had a significant proportion of post-randomisation drop-outs, introducing missing outcome data bias. This was evident from the sensitivity analysis where imputation of missing data by different scenarios resulted in different results.</P>
<P>While it may be impossible to blind the participants and healthcare providers to the intervention groups, it is possible to blind the outcome assessors and investigators to the intervention groups. Considering that the risk of conversion to open cholecystectomy in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is low and it is reasonable to exclude such participants from the analyses as such patients who require conversion to open cholecystectomy will be admitted in real-life, it is possible to conduct trials with no missing outcome data bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-15 17:03:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We followed the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) for this review. There were no language, publication status, or sample size restrictions. Thus, we minimised the bias due to selection of trials. However, we have used median for the meta-analyses when the mean was not available. We have also imputed the standard deviation from P values according to the formulae stated in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If the trials stated a P value less than 0.05, we calculated the standard deviation using a P value of 0.05. If the standard deviation could not be calculated because the trial reports just state that there was no statistical significance without mentioning the exact P value, we used the highest standard deviation among the other trials included in the outcome. This imputation of standard deviation may have introduced bias. However, sensitivity analyses performed on imputed values demonstrated no difference in results. The alternative to this imputation is to exclude such trials, but this would make the results even more difficult to interpret.</P>

<P>Further trials at low risk of bias are necessary, which are powered to measure differences in quality of life using validated quality of life measures such as EQ-5D, return to normal activity, and return to work. Trials need to be designed according to the SPIRIT Statement (<LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013</LINK>) and need to be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT Statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 492 patients in six trials, only 0.14% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis program does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of pain</B>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis of pain showing that the cumulative Z-curve (blue line) enters the futility area after the third trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 359 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 cm on the visual analogue scale, a variance (VAR) of 11.41, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. The results are compatible with lack of difference in pain scores between day-surgery and overnight stay surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of time to return to activity</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 2,354 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 day, a variance (VAR) of 74.96, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. After accruing 217 participants in two trials, only 9.2% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis program does not show the futility area. Neither the trial sequential boundaries nor the conventional statistical boundaries for benefits or harms of day-surgery versus overnight stay were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of proportion of participants requiring hospital readmission</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 21,030 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 3.24%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 290 participants in three trials, only 1.38% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis program does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of proportion of participants with failed discharge </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 15,968 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 20.09%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 81.98%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 419 participants in the five trials, only 2.62% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis program does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional statistical boundaries have also not been crossed at the end of five trials although the cumulative Z-curve crossed temporarily the conventional statistical boundary favouring overnight stay after two trials. Such a finding is likely to be a random error.</P>
