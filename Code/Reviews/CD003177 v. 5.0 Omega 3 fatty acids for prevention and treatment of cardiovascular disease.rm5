<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The review shows that it is not clear whether dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats (found in oily fish and some vegetable oils) alter total deaths, cardiovascular events (such as heart attacks and strokes) or cancers in the general population, or in people at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. When the analysis was limited to fish-based or plant-based, dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats there was still no evidence of reduction in deaths or cardiovascular events in any group.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It has been suggested that omega 3 (W3, n-3 or omega-3) fats from oily fish and plants are beneficial to health. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids alter total mortality, cardiovascular events or cancers using both RCT and cohort studies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Five databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to February 2002. No language restrictions were applied. Bibliographies were checked and authors contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs were included where omega 3 intake or advice was randomly allocated and unconfounded, and study duration was at least six months. Cohorts were included where a cohort was followed up for at least six months and omega 3 intake estimated. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were assessed for inclusion, data extracted and quality assessed independently in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was performed separately for RCT and cohort data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Forty eight randomised controlled trials (36,913 participants) and 41 cohort analyses were included. Pooled trial results did not show a reduction in the risk of total mortality or combined cardiovascular events in those taking additional omega 3 fats (with significant statistical heterogeneity). Sensitivity analysis, retaining only studies at low risk of bias, reduced heterogeneity and again suggested no significant effect of omega 3 fats. </P>
<P>Restricting analysis to trials increasing fish-based omega 3 fats, or those increasing short chain omega 3s, did not suggest significant effects on mortality or cardiovascular events in either group. Subgroup analysis by dietary advice or supplementation, baseline risk of CVD or omega 3 dose suggested no clear effects of these factors on primary outcomes. </P>
<P>Neither RCTs nor cohorts suggested increased relative risk of cancers with higher omega 3 intake but estimates were imprecise so a clinically important effect could not be excluded. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It is not clear that dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats alter total mortality, combined cardiovascular events or cancers in people with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease or in the general population. There is no evidence we should advise people to stop taking rich sources of omega 3 fats, but further high quality trials are needed to confirm suggestions of a protective effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular health.</P>
<P>There is no clear evidence that omega 3 fats differ in effectiveness according to fish or plant sources, dietary or supplemental sources, dose or presence of placebo. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Since the suggestion by Bang (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bang-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1976</LINK>), that the abundance of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet of the Greenland Eskimos was responsible for their low mortality from ischaemic heart disease, there has been considerable interest in the protective role and possible mechanism of action of marine unsaturated fats. This interest has spread to encompass plant oils rich in omega 3 fatty acids, including flax (linseed) and rapeseed (canola) oils (<LINK REF="REF-Nettleton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nettleton 1991</LINK>), their derivatives (e.g. margarines) and purslane leaves (<LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 1992</LINK>). Omega 3 fats (also called &#937;3 or n-3 fats) from fish sources include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5), and are the longer chain omega 3 fats. </P>
<P>Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA or &#945;-linolenic, 18:3) is the shorter chain omega 3 fat from plants (also found in grass fed meats), which is partially converted to longer chain omega 3 fatty acids within our bodies. There is some debate about the effectiveness of this conversion, which may differ depending on other dietary factors (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pawlosky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawlosky 2001</LINK>) and whether assessed over short or long term. For this reason the effectiveness of ALA may differ from that of the longer chain omega 3 fats.</P>
<P>Proposed mechanisms for the protective role of omega 3 fats against cardiovascular diseases include: lowering of blood pressure; altered lipid profile, especially reduced serum triglyceride concentration; reduced thrombotic tendency; anti-inflammatory effects; anti-arrhythmic effects including reduction in heart rate; improved vascular endothelial function; increased plaque stability; increased paraoxonase levels and improved insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Calabresi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calabresi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhatnagar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatnagar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BNF-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geelen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geelen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thies-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thies 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that most omega 3 fats are ingested in the form of oily fish or fish oil (often fish liver) capsules, reports of high levels of various toxic compounds such as mercury, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in oily fish (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAFF-1998A" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAFF 1998A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USFDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">USFDA 1995</LINK>) and fish oils (<LINK REF="REF-Liem-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liem 1997</LINK>) are concerning. These are all fat soluble and accumulate over time in the body, so harms may be exhibited only after long term supplementation with fish oils. Animal intervention studies and human cohorts who have suffered accidental exposure to dioxins and PCBs suggest that pre-natal exposure may cause sub-fertility problems and adult exposures may lead to an excess of total cancers (<LINK REF="REF-JECFA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">JECFA 2001</LINK>). Human cohorts exposed to high levels of mercury exhibit neurological problems, starting with paraesthesia, followed by stumbling and difficulty in articulating words, tunnel vision, impaired hearing, headaches, general muscle weakness, fatigue and irritability. In severe cases tremors or jerks can occur, and may lead on to coma and death (<LINK REF="REF-USFDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">USFDA 1995</LINK>). As many people eat oily fish once or twice a week or take fish oil supplements (oily fish intakes rose 44% between 1992 and 1997 in the UK, <LINK REF="REF-FSA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2000</LINK>) it is important to explore the potentially harmful effects of fish-associated omega 3 intake. It is also possible that omega 3 fats themselves may exhibit harm, for example through extension of bleeding times or suppression of normal immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-USFDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">USFDA 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epidemiological studies have supported the relationship between high omega 3 intake and lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard_x002d_Barbash-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard-Barbash 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burr-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1993</LINK>). However these associations could be due to some other characteristic of people who choose to eat fish. More reliable information concerning cause and effect is supplied by intervention trials in which participants are randomly allocated to receive fish oil or advice to eat more fish. </P>
<P>Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published on the effect of omega 3 fats on blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Appel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radack-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radack 1989</LINK>) and suggest a small blood pressure lowering effect at high doses. Non-systematic review suggests that fish oil supplementation will tend to reduce serum triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and chylomicrons, but may raise serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1993</LINK>). Fish oil capsules are licensed for triglyceride lowering in the UK, and more recently concentrated fish oil derivatives have become licensed for secondary prevention following myocardial infarction (MI). The effect of fish oil capsules on restenosis after angioplasty has been the subject of systematic review, in one review a significant protective effect was seen (<LINK REF="REF-Gapinski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gapinski 1993</LINK>) but in a wider selection of trials a small positive but nonsignificant effect was seen (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1992</LINK>). The evidence for anti-arrhythmic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 1996</LINK>) and anti-inflammatory mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 1989</LINK>) have been reviewed but not systematically. </P>
<P>The summation of many small protective risk factor effects of omega 3 fatty acids may add up to a large protective effect on mortality and/or cardiovascular events. Conversely, the protective effects may be small, dwarfed by toxic effects, or only exhibited in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. </P>
<P>A systematic review of trials on the effect of fish-based dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with coronary heart disease was recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 2002</LINK>) and suggested a strongly significant benefit. However a very large intervention study with discordant results has been published since this review, and no systematic review has yet attempted to balance any protective effects of omega 3 fats with associated harms. </P>
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to draw the evidence of benefits and harms together. As oily fish and fish oil supplements are commonly taken as food or supplements by the general public, it was planned that assessment of harm would be carried out whether or not omega 3 fatty acids appeared effective in protecting against death or cardiovascular events.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids on total mortality and on cardiovascular events, using all available randomised clinical trials and meta-analytic techniques where appropriate. It also assessed potential long term adverse effects using clinical trials and large prospective cohort studies.</P>
<P>The primary question to be answered by the review was:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Do dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids alter total mortality, cardiovascular events, cancers or other adverse events?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Secondary questions include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does any protection occur equally in those at low and at high risk of cardiovascular disease?</LI>
<LI>Does any protection depend on the dose of omega 3 fats taken per day?</LI>
<LI>Does any protection depend on the change in proportion of EPA in plasma or membrane fats?</LI>
<LI>If there are any effects, do they differ between dietary and supplemental omega 3 sources?</LI>
<LI>Does any protection differ between fish and plant omega 3 sources?</LI>
<LI>Does any protection depend on the presence or absence of a placebo?</LI>
<LI>Is any protection stronger with longer trial duration?</LI>
<LI>What are the side effects associated with increased omega 3 intake, and what is their prevalence?</LI>
</UL>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled clinical trials that included diet advice or dietary supplementation to promote omega 3 fatty acid intake, versus placebo, no supplementation or usual diet where mortality or cardiovascular events were recorded were included, provided they followed participants for at least six months (26 weeks or 180 days, for advice trials follow up must have been at least six months following advice, for trials where food or supplementation is provided then the provision must have continued for at least six months). Randomisation of individuals was accepted, or of clusters as long as there were at least six clusters randomised.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of harms</B>
<BR/>For information on potential adverse effects of omega 3 fat intake prospective cohort studies (followed for at least six months, in adult or child populations of any type) were sought as well as the studies identified above. Studies that assessed omega 3 intake through dietary assessment of omega 3 fats, oily fish and/or omega 3 supplements (by diet history, 24-hour recall, food frequency questionnaires or weighed food methods) or using body measurements of omega 3 fats (through assessment of fatty acids proportions in platelet membranes or serum phospholipids for example) were accepted. All potential adverse effects, or the absence of such effects, reported (including where available diagnosis of cancers, cancer mortality, neurological problems, birth rates, spontaneous abortion rates, birth defects, gender ratio) were collected.</P>
<P>A 'cohort' is a group of people clearly identified: a cohort study follows that group over time, and reports on what happens to them. A cohort study is an observational study, and it can be prospective or retrospective (<LINK REF="REF-Informed-Health-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Informed Health 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies of adults (18 years or older, men and/or women) at any risk of cardiovascular disease (with or without existing cardiovascular disease) were accepted (to include those with increased risk of cancer, those undergoing or who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty, and those with current or previous cardiovascular disease, nephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cysts, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, hayfever, asthma or ulcerative colitis). Participants who were pregnant or acutely ill (those with diagnosed cancer, undergoing heart or renal transplantation, with HIV or AIDS, on haemodialysis, with IgA glomerulonephritis, or any other renal problem except in diabetes) were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention must have been dietary supplementation, a provided diet or advice on diet. The foodstuffs or supplements must have been: oily fish (including mackerel, dogfish, salmon, herring, trout, tuna, sturgeon, stablefish, anchovy, sprat, coho, capelin, sardines, swordfish, sild, pilchard, brisling, menhaden, bloater, whitebait, crab and conger eel); fish oils (made from any of the above or a mixture of fish, or cod liver oil); linseed (flax), canola (rapeseed), perilla, purslane, mustard seed, candlenut, stillingia or walnut as a food, oil, made into a spreading fat or supplementing another food (such as bread or eggs) such that the product consumed had an omega 3 fat content of at least 10% of the total fat content. Refined eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or alpha-linolenic acids, or concentrated fish oils, were also accepted. Supplementation may have been in oil or capsule form or as food stuffs provided, to be consumed by mouth (excluding enteral and parenteral feeds and enemas). Studies were not included if they included multiple risk factor intervention on lifestyle factors other than diet and supplementation (unless the effect of diet or supplementation could be separated out from the other interventions). </P>
<P>Studies were included if they compared the effect of this dietary advice with the usual diet, no advice, no supplementation or placebo (which could be another oil, but not one on the list above). Trials were only included if outcome data could be collected (by communication with authors where necessary), and studies where it was stated or ascertained that no events occurred were included.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>The main outcome was total all-cause mortality. The other important outcomes were combined cardiovascular events (which include fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, sudden death and non-scheduled cardiovascular interventions -coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty), cancers and other adverse events (longer term neurological illnesses or reproductive problems, as well as any other reported illnesses).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>Secondary outcomes included individual cardiovascular events, risk factor changes and quality of life measures (feelings of health, time off work). Risk factor changes collected were body weight, blood pressure, urinary thromboxane (2 or 3 series), participant fatty acid data (from plasma, platelets or adipose tissue), total, LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Data concerning side effects were collected.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following sources were included in the literature search process. <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (CD ROM, for RCTs and relevant systematic reviews, to 2002, issue 1), MEDLINE (OVID, for RCTs 1998 to February 2002, for cohorts 1966 to February 2002), EMBASE (OVID, for RCTs 1998 to February 2002, for cohorts 1980 to February 2002), National Research Register (to February 2002), SIGLE, bibliographies and experts.</P>
<P>As MEDLINE and EMBASE had been thoroughly searched up to 1998 for all randomised controlled trials, and these have been added to Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for RCTs for 1998 to 2002 only. <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and MEDLINE search strategies for RCTs are included in full in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, as is the EMBASE strategy for cohort studies.</P>
<P>Authors of all included studies were contacted for references to studies not yet identified, including published, unpublished or ongoing studies. Published systematic reviews addressing diet and heart health were sought as a source of RCTs. Attempts were made to obtain full-text translations and/or evaluations of all relevant non-English articles.</P>

<P>
<BR/>When a title/abstract could not be rejected with certainty, the full text of the article was obtained for further evaluation. If the reviewer was uncertain about the appropriateness of rejecting the article, the full text article was retrieved.</P>
<P>An in/out form was used to assess studies for inclusion (or otherwise) into the review. At this stage included RCTs also had to provide data on whether participants had suffered from at least one of the stated outcomes, or state clearly that no participants had suffered from these outcomes. The authors of all potentially included RCTs were contacted for further information on trial methodology and outcomes. The inclusion of full text RCTs and cohorts was assessed independently by two assessors and any differences between reviewers' results were resolved by discussion and, when necessary, in consultation with the review team.</P>
<P>Two data extraction forms were designed for this review, one for RCTs and one for cohort studies. For RCTs data concerning participants, interventions, and outcomes, as described above in the selection criteria section, were extracted. Data from dietary advice studies were extracted at the latest point available in the trial (regardless of the amount of reinforcement of the original dietary message), while data from supplemental studies were extracted to the point that supplementation ended, or the trial ended, whichever was earlier. Continuous data were extracted until the latest point available in fixed term trials, but in studies where participants were followed up for varying durations (aside from dropouts) the participants data were extracted from the first time point following the mean trial duration. Data from periods following the end of a trial were never used in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Trial quality characteristics, as suggested by Chalmers (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1990</LINK>), were extracted onto this form. In addition data were collected on potential effect modifiers including participants baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, trial duration, intensity of intervention (dietary advice, diet provided, dietary advice plus supplementation, supplementation alone), source of omega 3 fats (plant sources, fish oil supplements, fish consumption), medications used (including antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic or antithrombotic medication) and smoking status. Baseline risk of cardiovascular disease was defined as follows: high risk were participants with existing vascular disease including a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, angina, heart failure or previous coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty; moderate risk were participants with a familial risk, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure; low risk were other participants. Where provided, data on the effect of diet on risk factors for cardiovascular disease including blood pressure, lipids and weight were collected. For each published RCT in which adverse effects were noted, the type of effect, how and at what time points in the study the information or data on these effects was elicited or collected and recorded, omega 3 dose, duration of intake, type of omega 3 (from fish or plant sources, as food, supplement or supplemented food) and the frequency of adverse effects (number of cases divided by the number of people exposed to the treatment) were noted.</P>
<P>For cohort studies data on setting, design, measurement of the exposure to omega 3s, details of participant characteristics (in high and low exposure groups), similarity at baseline, participant flow, endpoint criteria, details of toxins (PCBs, mercury, dioxins etc) provided, crude and most adjusted data on outcomes were extracted. </P>
<P>Original reports of trial results were extracted by two reviewers independently. Differences between reviewers' results were resolved by discussion and, when necessary, in consultation with a third reviewer or the review team. Where the original trialist had replied and expressed an interest in the review the extracted data form was sent to the trialist for comments and corrections.</P>

<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>All quality assessment was performed independently and in duplicate for each included study.</P>
<P>For RCTs, trial quality characteristics, as suggested by Chalmers (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1990</LINK>), were extracted onto the data extraction form. These were as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment was coded as adequate, unclear or inadequate;</LI>
<LI>Participant blinding was coded as yes, unclear or no;</LI>
<LI>Provider blinding was coded as yes, unclear or no;</LI>
<LI>Outcome assessor blinding was coded as yes, unclear or no.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A trial was considered to be at low risk of bias if allocation concealment was adequate, and participant, provider and outcome assessor blinding were all coded 'yes'. All other trials were considered at moderate or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>For cohort studies, quality assessment was based on criteria felt to be important for this review. Criteria included: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether the design used an internal or external control group (internal means all subjects were drawn from the same source, and the exposure subsequently determined, external means that most and least exposed groups were defined a priori and came from different sources);</LI>
<LI>number lost to follow up;</LI>
<LI>baseline similarity of the most and least exposed groups;</LI>
<LI>whether any dissimilarities appeared to have been adjusted for in the most adjusted analysis (the most adjusted analysis was that which adjusted for the greatest number of potential confounders);</LI>
<LI>whether the assessor of the exposure was blinded to the outcome (coded as 'yes' for biochemical analyses, and 'yes, probably' for dietary analyses where blinding is likely but not absolutely certain), and;</LI>

<BR/>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>Primary measures of interest were the effect of dietary advice or supplementation on <BR/>(1) total mortality;<BR/>(2) combined numbers of cardiovascular events and interventions (including fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, heart failure, sudden death, peripheral vascular disease, angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting);<BR/>(3) adverse effects.</P>
<P>For the RCT studies, for dichotomous outcomes, we extracted numbers of participants experiencing an outcome, and total numbers of participants randomised, for each study arm. For continuous outcomes number of participants assessed, means and standard deviations of the final readings in each treatment arm were extracted. Treatment/control differences in the outcomes were combined across studies using relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) in random effects meta-analysis. It was intended that if trials randomised by cluster were identified the patient numbers would be reduced to an effective sample size as described by <LINK REF="REF-Hauck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauck 1991</LINK>, however no such trials were identified. For combined outcomes (e.g. combined cardiovascular events) attempts were made to add numbers of individuals experiencing specific outcomes within studies, but only where we could be certain that we were not counting individual participants more than once within any one of our review outcome categories. However, individuals may have been counted for more than one of the review outcomes. Studies where it was known that an outcome did not occur in either arm were included in the meta-analyses for information.</P>
<P>For the cohort studies, the most adjusted relative risk or odds ratio comparing the most exposed quantile (tertile, quintile etc) with the least exposed quantile was used. Along with information on the number of events in the least exposed quantile, and the total numbers of participants in the most and least exposed quantiles, an 'adjusted number of events in the most exposed quantile' was calculated and rounded to the nearest whole number. This 'adjusted number of events in the most exposed quantile' was used with the actual number of events in the least exposed group, and the total numbers of participants in the most and least exposed quantiles in random effects meta-analysis. When it was not possible to extract these numbers, but the relationship between relevant measures of omega 3 and outcomes had been assessed in the published paper, the study was included. For such studies details were provided in the table of characteristics of included cohort studies, and the study was included in the relevant forest plot, but without numerical data added (to alert the reader to the presence of the missing data and allow them to assess the potential bias introduced by it).</P>
<P>Where more than one analysis on a specific cohort of participants was relevant to an outcome (for example, for the NHS cohort there are papers assessing both the relationship of alpha-linolenic acid and cardiovascular mortality, and the relationship between total omega 3 fats and cardiovascular mortality), only one analysis was used for that cohort per outcome. The rules for choosing which analysis was used were as follows (if the first rule decides, then ignore the rest, move down until a decision is reached):<BR/>(1) combined omega 3 fats over any single omega 3 fraction;<BR/>(2) the largest population involved in the analysis (and a whole cohort analysis over a nested case control analysis);<BR/>(3) EPA chosen rather than DHA, which is chosen over alpha-linolenic acid;<BR/>(4) fat from fish is chosen over fat from fish liver or supplements.</P>
<P>Subgrouping was used to explore the effects of the following factors on mortality and cardiovascular events in included RCTs: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>fish or vegetable source of omega 3 fats - fish sources included oily fish, fish oils and purified eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid, plant sources included linseed (flax), canola (rapeseed), mustard seed, candlenut or walnut oils or as a food, and purified alpha-linolenic acid;</LI>
<LI>fish omega 3 dose - low dose 0.4 to 2.4g/day, medium dose 2.5 to 4.4 g/day, and high dose 4.5g/day and over of combined long chain omega 3 fats;</LI>
<LI>dietary or supplemental source of omega 3 fats - dietary advice on fish intake, supplemental foods (for example margarine fortified with rapeseed, or tins of sardines) provided by the study, or supplements (capsules or oils) provided [note: <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK> generally provided dietary omega 3 advice, with the option of taking fish oil capsules if participants found fish unpleasant, but almost a third of participants were randomised to fish oil capsules, without being given dietary advice. This study was only included in the subgrouping for the outcomes total mortality and sudden death as separate outcome data were only available for these outcomes.];</LI>
<LI>trial duration - studies with short follow up (6 to 11 months), medium follow up (12 to 23 months), medium long follow up (24 to 47 months) and long follow up (48 or more months).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's test and assumed to be present when p&lt;0.1.</P>
<P>Meta-regression was used to explore effects of omega 3 dose and duration of trial on mortality and cardiovascular events. Random effects meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Berkley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkley 1995</LINK>) was performed using the STATA command metareg (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>): log(e) relative risk vs dose or duration, weighted by the standard error of the log(e) relative risk.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was used to assess robustness of results on RCTs to trial quality. RCTs where allocation concealment was agreed as 'done', and where participants, providers and outcome assessors were all masked were not removed in sensitivity analysis, but all other studies were. Funnel plots were used to assess for evidence of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type and frequency of side effects and adverse effects were tabulated (with the other extracted data on adverse effects) and compared between different studies and designs.</P>
<P>Pooling of cohort studies which assessed cardiovascular outcomes was not specified in the protocol, but was performed to provide the reader with a complete picture of the evidence. Conclusions have not been drawn from this data.</P>
<P>The review will be updated within two years of publication. At the update we plan to run separate analyses of fish-based (long chain) omega 3 fats and ALA, and will pool them only as a secondary analysis. Additionally we plan to use both Cochran's test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) to assess heterogeneity.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>15159 titles and abstracts were screened following the electronic and bibliographic searches, or were recommended by experts. Of these 926 appeared potentially relevant and were ordered as full text papers to be assessed for inclusion. 25 papers could not be traced (due to incorrect bibliographic details in the original reference or to the British Library not having access to a particular journal or book), and 464 papers were clearly not appropriate as soon as the full paper was examined (93 of these were collected as potential cohorts, but were either not actual cohorts or did not assess fish or omega 3 fats in any way, and 371 were potential RCTs and were excluded as their follow up period was less than six months). This left 437 papers where inclusion was assessed independently in duplicate (each by LH plus one of the following: RLT, RAH, CDS, HM, PND, ARN or RAR). One hundred and twenty potential RCTs were excluded at this stage, as were 150 potential cohort studies (see flow diagram, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, for further details). Fourteen RCTs fulfilled all the inclusion criteria, but it was unclear whether any outcome data existed as contact could not be made with the study authors, or the authors were unsure. These papers are found in the list of studies awaiting assessment and will be included in future if outcome data become available. After amalgamation of papers into discrete studies it became apparent that 48 RCTs and 41 cohorts fulfilled all inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Randomised Controlled Trials</B>
<BR/>Forty eight randomised controlled trials comparing at least six months of omega 3 fats with placebo or control were included in this review. These trials included 36,913 participants, in studies with from six participants per arm (<LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>) to 6700 participants per arm (<LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>). Eight studies included at least 500 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eritsland-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eritsland 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansen-1999A" TYPE="STUDY">Johansen 1999A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leaf-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sirtori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sirtori 1998</LINK>). Participants were at high risk of cardiovascular disease in 21 of the trials, at moderate risk in 10 and at low risk in 17. Participants were predominantly male (70% or more) in 24 trials, roughly equal (31 to 69% male) in 17, predominantly women (0 to 30% men) in five trials and not stated in two. Participants mean ages were in the 30s in six studies, 40s in seven studies, 50s in 27 studies, 60s in four studies, 70s in no studies, 80s in one study and unclear in three studies.</P>
<P>Most studies (44) provided a dietary supplement (36 as capsules, six as oil (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borchgrevink-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Borchgrevink 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connor-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>), one as liquid emulsion (<LINK REF="STD-Rossing-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rossing 1996</LINK>) and one as an enriched margarine (<LINK REF="STD-Bemelmans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bemelmans 2002</LINK>)), while three provided dietary advice primarily (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 1991</LINK>), and one study provided dietary advice plus food supplements (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkkinen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkkinen 1998</LINK>). Supplementation was generally with fish-based omega 3 fats (rich in EPA, DPA and DHA fatty acids), but five studies provided plant-based omega 3 fat (alpha-linolenic acid) supplementation in at least one arm (<LINK REF="STD-Bemelmans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bemelmans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borchgrevink-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Borchgrevink 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkkinen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkkinen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>). Doses of fish-based omega 3 fatty acids (EPA, DPA plus DHA) varied from 0.4 to 7g per day. </P>
<P>Control groups received vegetable oils (25 studies: olive oil 14 studies, olive oil emulsion one study, sunflower oil two studies, corn oil six studies, olive and palm oil combination one study, vegetable oil one study), other types of fats (mixed triglycerides one study, linoleic rich margarine in one study, fat replicating the composition of an average European diet in one study), other 'inert' or ill-defined substances (liquid paraffin one study, aluminium hydroxide one study, air filled capsules two studies, 'placebo' two studies), different dietary advice in one study, or nothing/ no placebo (13 studies). </P>
<P>Intervention time was six-11 months in 23 studies, 12-17 months in 16 studies, 24-47 months in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bemelmans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bemelmans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-_x0028_HARP_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks (HARP) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Schacky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">von Schacky 1999</LINK>) and 48 months or over in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The main study outcome was cardiovascular in nature in 32 studies. Nine studies aimed to measure death or cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="STD-Borchgrevink-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Borchgrevink 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nye-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>). In 12 studies restenosis or CABG patency was the endpoint and 13 aimed to measure various cardiovascular risk factors (lipids five studies, blood pressure two studies, glycaemic parameters two studies, and one study each for 'cardiovascular risk factors', peripheral arterial compliance, fibrinolytic parameters, diabetic nephropathy, immunoreactivity, and albuminurea) [note, several studies state more than one main study outcome, so numbers in this paragraph are not additive]. Other main study outcomes include measures of arthritis activity (four studies, one of which includes participants with plaque psoriasis), gut status (for those with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, seven studies), lung function (for those with asthma and/or hayfever, two studies), tissue incorporation of omega 3 fats (one study), liver enzymes (for those with chronic hepatitis, one study) and neurological tests (for those with dementia of cardiovascular disease, one study).</P>

As several cohorts of people were used in more than one included analysis (for example, the Physician's Health Study is represented in 5 included cohort analyses: a 1994 nested case control study assessing correlation of plasma fatty acids with prostate cancer, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Gann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Gann 1994</LINK>; a 1995 nested case control study on plasma fatty acids and myocardial infarction, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Guallar-1995" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Guallar 1995</LINK>; a 1995 cohort analysis on dietary fish and various cardiovascular outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Morris-1995" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Morris 1995</LINK>; a 1998 cohort analysis on dietary fish and omega 3 fat intake and total and cardiovascular mortality, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Albert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Albert 1998</LINK>; and finally a 2002 nested case control study on plasma fatty acids and sudden cardiac death, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Albert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Albert 2002</LINK>) each analysis included in the review is referenced by the name of the cohort (PHS here) and the first author and year of publication of the analysis used where space allowed (here Albert et al 2002). A distinction needs to be made between cohorts (groups of people being followed prospectively) and cohort analyses (analyses of data from one or more cohorts).</P>
<P>Forty seven published analyses from 26 cohorts were included in the review (this is counting the Dutch cohort of the Seven Countries study (<LINK REF="STD-z7Cs-NL-Oomen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">z7Cs NL Oomen 2000</LINK>), the Zutphen study (<LINK REF="STD-zZutphen-Miedema-93" TYPE="STUDY">zZutphen Miedema 93</LINK>) and the Zutphen Elderly study (<LINK REF="STD-zZutphenES-Kalmijn" TYPE="STUDY">zZutphenES Kalmijn</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-zZutphenES-Oomen-01" TYPE="STUDY">zZutphenES Oomen 01</LINK>) as one cohort as there were individuals who were represented in all three). Counting numbers of participants at the longest cohort follow up published (excluding nested case control analyses) studies included between 80 and 84,688 participants (overall 563,218 individuals, plus those in the Umea (<LINK REF="STD-zUmea-Chajes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">zUmea Chajes 1999</LINK>) and Janus (<LINK REF="STD-zJanus-Harvei-1997" TYPE="STUDY">zJanus Harvei 1997</LINK>) studies where the total size of the cohort was not described).

Follow up at this point was from four to 25 years.</P>
<P>Fourteen cohorts consisted predominantly of men (at least 70% men), four cohorts were even (31 to 69% men), and seven cohorts were predominantly women (0 to 30% men). Gender mix was unclear in one cohort. Mean age at the start of the cohort was under 20 years in one cohort, in the 30s in one cohort, 40s in three cohorts, 50s in 11 cohorts, 60s in three cohorts, 70s in one cohort and unclear in six cohorts.</P>
<P>Two cohorts (Finnish cohort of Euroaspire, <LINK REF="STD-zEuroaspire-Erkkila" TYPE="STUDY">zEuroaspire Erkkila</LINK>; and the Physicians Health Study, <LINK REF="STD-zPHS-Albert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">zPHS Albert 1998</LINK>) assessed omega 3 intake by both dietary and biochemical means, other cohorts by either dietary or biochemical assessment. Dietary assessment (used in 18 cohorts) was by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or questionnaire in 13 cohorts, cross-check dietary interview in three cohorts, and by 24 hour recall or diet history in two cohorts. Biochemical assessment (used in ten cohorts) was of serum (seven cohorts), plasma (two cohorts) or whole blood (one cohort).</P>
<P>Omega 3 fraction assessed was all omega 3 fats (EPA + DHA + DPA + ALA) in three cohorts, 'mixed long chain omega 3 fats' (EPA + DHA + DPA) in eight cohorts, EPA in 12 cohorts, DHA in 11 cohorts, DPA in five cohorts, ALA in 10 cohorts, DHA + DPA in one cohort, 'regular cod liver oil use' in two cohorts, fatty fish intake in two cohorts, fat from fish or shellfish in one cohort and number of main meals with fish liver in one cohort.

Thirteen cohorts (in 22 publications) provided information on cardiovascular outcomes (five from the USA, seven from Europe and one from Asia). Ten cohorts (in ten publications) provided information about cancer outcomes (five from the USA, five from Europe). One US cohort provided information on child health and development, three cohorts (one from the USA, two from Europe) on respiratory diseases, two cohorts (one each from the USA and Europe) on development of diabetes, two US cohorts combined provided information on development of multiple sclerosis, and two US cohorts combined on development of age-related macular degeneration.</P>

<B>Cohorts</B>
<BR/>All included cohorts recruited an internal (all subjects drawn from the same group, and exposure subsequently determined) rather than external control group (where most and least exposed groups came from different sources determined a priori). Twenty two of the 26 included cohorts performed assessments of exposure on the whole cohort, divided the whole cohort into quantiles according to that exposure, assessed the whole cohort for outcomes and related quantiles to risk of outcome. Some of these 22 cohorts also performed nested case control studies on some cohort participants. Four cohorts only published relevant nested case control studies, rather than full cohort assessments.</P>
<P>Losses to follow up were unclear in 16 cohorts, and were stated in the remaining ten. Of these ten cohorts, seven reported fewer than 5% dropouts, while three reported higher levels (22% in <LINK REF="STD-zARIC-Zheng-1999" TYPE="STUDY">zARIC Zheng 1999</LINK>, 9% in <LINK REF="STD-zMenarche-Maclure-91" TYPE="STUDY">zMenarche Maclure 91</LINK>, 29% in one analysis from the Zutphen Elderly Study, <LINK REF="STD-zZutphenES-Kalmijn" TYPE="STUDY">zZutphenES Kalmijn</LINK> (though it was less than 5% in the other analysis from this cohort, <LINK REF="STD-zZutphenES-Oomen-01" TYPE="STUDY">zZutphenES Oomen 01</LINK>)). In total 15 of the 47 cohort analyses reported losses to follow up.</P>
<P>Baseline similarity between those with high and low exposure to omega 3 fats was not classified as 'good' for any included cohort. Baseline similarity was unclear in 14 cohorts (often where several different exposures were assessed the similarity of participants was reported against another type of exposure). Baseline characteristics were clearly different in 12 cohorts, and appeared to be adequately adjusted for in five cohorts, not fully adjusted for in six cohorts and unclear in one cohort.</P>
<P>There appeared to be adequate blinding of the assessor of exposures to outcomes in 13 cohort analyses, and probable blinding (as temporal factors made it unlikely that dietary assessments would have been analysed after the outcomes occurred, but they may have been) in the remaining 34 analyses. Outcome assessors were blinded to exposure in 15 cohorts, not in two cohorts and unclear in nine. </P>

<BR/>
<B>
<I>Total mortality (comparison 01, outcome 01)</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Forty four of the 48 included RCTs provided information on total mortality. While no deaths occurred in 29 of these RCTs, deaths did occur in 15 RCTs (1995 deaths in total, from 36195 people randomised to the 44 trials). The relative risk of death in those participants randomised to omega 3 supplementation or advice, compared with those on placebo or no such dietary advice, was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.03), with significant heterogeneity (p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.04). Sensitivity analysis, removing all studies except those at low summary risk of bias, still resulted in no significant effects on mortality, the relative risk was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.36, 138 deaths, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.57). Conversely, meta-analysis of the three relevant included cohort studies suggested a protective effect of higher omega 3 intakes on total mortality, the relative risk was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.21).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity here refers to statistically significant variation. If it exists then the variety in the data from different trials is so large that it is not helpful to pool them. In other words, the pooled relative risk may not be very meaningful as it provides an average that does not reflect the circumstances in specific trials very well.</P>
<P>Subgrouping by fish or vegetable source of omega 3 fat did not suggest a significant effect of omega 3 fats on death in either subgroup, though statistical heterogeneity disappeared in the vegetable source group (which only had 140 events in total). Subgrouping by omega 3 dose resulted in very few events, and no statistical heterogeneity, in the medium and high dose studies, and no significant effects on death in any of the subgroups. Subgrouping by dietary or supplemental source of omega 3 fats suggested no significant effect of dietary advice, supplemental foods or supplements (with significant heterogeneity for the dietary advice only). Subgrouping by trial duration resulted in few deaths in the 6-11 month and 12-23 month groupings, but the 1285 deaths in the 24-47 month grouping suggested significant protection with omega 3 fats, the relative risk was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.93, no significant heterogeneity). This effect was lost in the 48 months and over subgroup. Subgrouping by baseline risk of cardiovascular disease suggested no significant effect of omega 3 fats on deaths in any subgroup. Subgrouping by the presence or absence of placebo suggested no significant effect of omega 3 fats in either group, with statistical heterogeneity in the group of trials without placebo.</P>
<P>Overall, the heterogeneity seen in the main analysis, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analyses was lost whenever the <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK> study was removed. This single large study (including 3114 male angina sufferers) found a large but not quite significant <U>increase</U> in deaths in the group randomised to omega 3 dietary advice over a period of 36 to 108 months (525 deaths in total, the relative risk was of death 1.15 (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.34). Removing this study results in an overall relative risk of death of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.91) with no significant heterogeneity (p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.52). </P>
<P>Meta-regression of log(e) RR of total mortality against long chain omega 3 dose did not suggest a significant relationship. Log(e) RR of total mortality vs trial duration did suggest a significant relationship, regression co-efficient 0.008 (95% confidence interval 0.003 to 0.012) consistent with the relative risk of mortality rising with longer duration (or the benefits of added omega 3 fats decreasing over time, and eventually becoming harmful). However, this relationship was lost on removal of <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>The funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) was asymmetrical, suggesting that smaller studies were more likely to show a reduction in mortality in the omega 3 arm of a trial. If we remove studies with fewer than 50 deaths from the meta-analyses we find that the funnel plot appears less biased (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), however there is still very strong heterogeneity, the relative risk was 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.10, 1923 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity </SUB>0.002).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Combined cardiovascular events (comparison 01, outcome 02)</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Thirty one included RCTs provided data on combined cardiovascular events (numbers of participants experiencing at least one of the following: cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; stroke; new angina; new heart failure; a peripheral vascular event; unplanned coronary artery bypass grafting; or angioplasty). In thirteen of these studies no participants experienced a cardiovascular event, events did occur in the remaining 18 RCTs (2628 events in a total of 35140 participants). Meta-analysis did not suggest a significant effect of omega 3 supplementation on cardiovascular events, relative risk 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.12, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> &lt;0.0001). Sensitivity analysis, removing studies with a medium or high risk of bias, reduced but did not remove statistical heterogeneity, with no significant effect on risk of cardiovascular events, the relative risk was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.37, 570 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.07). Similarly, meta-analysis of cohort data did not suggest any effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events, and was significantly heterogeneous, the relative risk was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.13, 1929 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> &lt;0.0001). </P>
<P>Subgrouping by fish or vegetable source, omega 3 dose, dietary or supplemental source, baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, presence or absence of placebo, or removal of the <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK> study did not result in significant effects of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events, and generally reduced heterogeneity a little, but not completely. The exception was grouping by trial duration where no effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events was seen at 6-11 months or 12-23 months, but at 24-47 months a significantly protective effect (the relative risk was 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.98, no significant heterogeneity) was seen, and at over 48 months a significantly harmful effect, the relative risk was 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.59) was seen, incorporating data from only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Meta-regression of log(e) RR of total mortality against either long chain omega 3 dose or trial duration did not suggest any significant relationships. </P>
<P>A funnel plot shows asymmetry, strongly suggesting bias, with smaller studies more likely to see a reduced relative risk for combined cardiovascular events. If we remove studies with fewer than 100 combined cardiovascular events from the meta-analyses we find that the funnel plot appears less biased, however the summary estimate of the meta-analysis for combined cardiovascular events remains non-significant and with high levels of heterogeneity, the relative risk was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.31, 2263 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.0004).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cancers (comparison 01, outcome 03)</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Only ten trials reported cancer outcomes, two of which reported no cancers. Overall 391 cancer diagnoses or deaths were reported from 17433 participants. Most trials with data provided information on deaths from cancer, rather than diagnosis of cancer, so that we are unlikely to be seeing long enough follow up to track build up of body toxins, followed by cancer initiation, development and fatality all in the span of a randomised trial. </P>
<P>There was no significant effect of omega 3 fats on cancers, the relative risk was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.30, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.91). Sensitivity analysis removing studies at medium or high risk of bias left five trials with 7 events. With few events, subgrouping provided no useful information.</P>
<P>Ten cohort studies provided data on cancer outcomes, of which seven provided appropriate data for meta-analysis, overall 832 events in the highest and lowest quantiles. Studies assessed total cancer mortality (1), and diagnosis of prostate (4), colorectal (2), lung (1) and breast (2) cancers. Meta-analysis did not suggest any effect of high omega 3 intake on cancers, the relative risk was 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.19, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.27). The three studies which had data not useable in the meta-analysis did not report significant effects of omega 3 fats, except that <LINK REF="STD-zNHS-Holmes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">zNHS Holmes 1999</LINK> found a significantly increased risk of breast cancer in women on higher omega 3 intakes, which was not confirmed in the other breast cancer analysis (<LINK REF="STD-zUmea-Chajes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">zUmea Chajes 1999</LINK>).</P>

<B>
<I>Other long term health effects (comparison 01, outcome 04)</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Other long term health effects recorded in included RCTs were generally recorded in very low numbers. They included: pulmonary embolism, thromboembolism, pulmonary failure, pulmonary function/asthma, meningitis, eczema, psychiatric disorders and dementia. Outcomes where over ten events (diagnoses of, or deaths from) were recorded across trials included diabetes, urolithiasis and thrombophlebitis, these are represented in comparison 01 04, but none appear to bear a significant relationship with additional omega 3 fats. Several studies recorded health status in people with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or rheumatoid arthritis, these have not been reported as they relate to development rather than diagnosis of pre-existing conditions.<BR/>

<BR/>Non-cardiovascular, non-cancer outcomes assessed within cohort studies included development of respiratory diseases, cognitive impairment, age-related macular degeneration, diabetes and early menarche. There was no suggestion of an effect of a high omega 3 consumption on development of respiratory diseases, cognitive impairment or age-related macular degeneration. </P>
<P>Data from the Iowa Women's Health Study (<LINK REF="STD-zIWHS-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">zIWHS Meyer 2001</LINK>) suggested that a high intake of omega 3 fats may be associated with a significantly greater risk of developing diabetes. However, this study used self-reporting of diabetic status, and there were problems with this measure (of 44 women reporting that they had diabetes at baseline, only 28 were confirmed as having diabetes when their physicians were contacted). The Uppsala CVD screening cohort (<LINK REF="STD-zUppsala-Vessby-1994" TYPE="STUDY">zUppsala Vessby 1994</LINK>) also assessed the relationship between serum EPA and DHA and diagnosis of diabetes (the study directly measured glucose tolerance), and found no significant relationship (the numbers presented could not be used in meta-analysis). Meta-analysis of RCTs with relevant data did not support a significant effect of omega 3 fats on diagnosis of, or death from, diabetes. </P>
<P>Maclure (<LINK REF="STD-zMenarche-Maclure-91" TYPE="STUDY">zMenarche Maclure 91</LINK>) assessed the relationship between dietary omega 3 fats and early menarche (defined as menarche before 12.5 years) and found that girls consuming more omega 3 fats were significantly more likely to undergo early menarche, the relative risk was 2.39 (95% confidence interval 1.33 to 4.30). The health effects of this overall are unclear, but a relationship has been found between early menarche and increased risk of breast cancer.</P>

There was a suggestion of greater effect at higher omega 3 dose.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>Summary of results<BR/>
</B>Meta-analysis of 48 included RCTs assessing the effects of increased omega 3 fats on total mortality or combined cardiovascular events found strongly significant statistical heterogeneity. This heterogeneity disappeared in the analysis of total mortality when studies at medium or high risk of bias were removed, suggesting no significant effect of omega 3 fats on deaths, the relative risk was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.36,138 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity </SUB>0.57). There was no suggestion of a benefit on combined cardiovascular events in the sensitivity analysis, with marginal heterogeneity, the relative risk was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.37, 570 events, p<SUB>heterogeneity</SUB> 0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP> 48.7%). Cohort studies did suggest significant reduction in total mortality with high (compared to low) omega 3 intake.</P>
<P>Subgrouping only trials increasing fish-based omega 3 fats, or only trials that increased plant-based omega 3 fats, did not suggest significant effects on mortality or cardiovascular events in either group. Subgrouping by omega 3 dose, dietary or supplemental source, trial duration, baseline risk of cardiovascular disease and presence of placebo tended to produce significant results where there were a substantial number of events and the DART 2 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>) was not present. Removal of this trial suggested significant reduction of mortality in participants randomised to omega 3, and removed the apparent heterogeneity. Meta-regression suggested a significant relationship between total mortality and trial duration, with the relative risk for those on additional omega 3 fats increasing (to reach and overtake 1.0) in longer trials, suggesting that an early protective effect of omega 3 fats later becomes harmful (this relationship was lost when the DART 2 trial was removed). </P>
<P>Neither RCT nor cohort studies suggested a significant increased risk of cancer or stroke with higher omega 3 intake, but there were not enough events to rule out clinically important effects.</P>
<P>No significant and robust effects of omega 3 fats were seen on secondary event outcomes. Omega 3 supplementation did significantly reduce triglyceride levels and increased LDL cholesterol, but had no significant effects on weight, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Randomisation to omega 3 increased the risk of dropping out due to side effects, a bad or fishy taste, nausea and any gastrointestinal side effect, but not overall risk of dropping out of the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparisons with other studies<BR/>
</B>The results of this review differ from those of a recent high quality systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 2002</LINK>). Bucher et al searched for RCTs comparing dietary or non-dietary intake of omega 3 fats with a control diet or placebo in people with coronary heart disease and with at least six months follow up. They included 11 RCTs (9 of these were included in this review: <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansen-1999A" TYPE="STUDY">Johansen 1999A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaul-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kaul 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leaf-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-_x0028_HARP_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks (HARP) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Schacky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">von Schacky 1999</LINK> while two were excluded from our review as they included dietary interventions additional to increased omega 3: <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Lorgeril-1999" TYPE="STUDY">de Lorgeril 1999</LINK>) with a total of 15806 participants and 1335 deaths. As their search period extended to 1999 the DART 2 study (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>) was not included. As in this review <LINK REF="REF-Bucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 2002</LINK> found no significant effect of added omega 3 on non-fatal myocardial infarction (the relative risk was 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.2), but they found significant protective effects on fatal myocardial infarction, the relative risk was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 0.8), sudden death, the relative risk was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 0.9) and overall mortality, the relative risk was 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 0.9). They reported publication bias (an asymmetrical distribution of trials with smaller trials showing a larger effect size than the one larger trial, <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The differences between Bucher et al's results and those in this review cannot be explained by our addition of studies where alpha-linolenic acid (the plant-based omega 3 fat) was the active intervention , or by our inclusion of studies where participants were initially at low or moderate risk of cardiovascular disease. The vast majority of deaths noted in this review occurred in studies where participants initially had evidence of cardiovascular disease and where additional omega 3 fats were of fish origin. Pooling only those studies at high cardiovascular risk, or providing omega 3 fats only from a fish source, still produces non-statistically significant relative risks of mortality with significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>), as does pooling only those studies with participants at high cardiovascular risk <U>and</U> where fish based omega 3 supplements or advice were used (data not shown).</P>
<P>Meta-analyses in this systematic review, removing the DART 2 trial, produces relative risks similar to those in the Bucher review: non-fatal myocardial infarction, the relative risk was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.50), fatal myocardial infarction, the relative risk was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.91), sudden death, the relative risk was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.10) and overall mortality, the relative risk was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.91). This tends to confirm the evidence from subgrouping that there is something about the DART 2 study which is different from the other included studies. Its results are distinct and this results in heterogeneity between the results and altered pooled effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Understanding why the results of the DART 2 study are different</B>
<BR/>Without the DART 2 study pooling of RCTs of omega 3 fats indicates significant reduction in our risk of death and fatal myocardial infarction. With DART 2 we do not see this protection and our results become strongly heterogeneous. It is tempting to dismiss the results of the DART 2 study as inconsistent, inconvenient and therefore irrelevant. However, with 3114 participants DART 2 is larger than DART 1 (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>), and only <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK> (11323 participants for a median of 40 months) and <LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK> (13406 participants for 12 months) enrolled more participants. It is also the longest intervention study to date, with participants followed up for 36 to 108 months. The number of deaths recorded by DART 2 (525) were second only to <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK> (1031 deaths). This is not a trial to be easily dismissed, and if the results of DART 2 turn out to describe more accurately the true effect of omega 3 fats on health then this is important to know.</P>
<P>We need to assess why the inconsistency exists between the results of DART 2 and the pre-DART 2 studies, and to discover whether this could this be explained by bias (in DART 2, or the earlier studies, or both). First, we will assess whether the fundamental question posed by the DART 2 trial was different from that posed in the other studies. If not, perhaps the very different outcomes were simply due to a play of chance.</P>
<P>
<B>How is DART 2 different from the other included RCTs?<BR/>Type of cardiovascular disease</B>
<BR/>Another distinguishing feature of DART 2 is that it is the only RCT included to enrol men specifically because they were being treated for angina, but many others enrolled people post myocardial infarction or undergoing angioplasty, many of whom presumably also had angina, and who would have similar underlying disease. However, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the GISSI trial (<LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>) has suggested that the people who benefited most from omega 3 were those with heart failure, and these are likely to be much more common in a group of people who have had myocardial infarctions (<LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>As Michael Burr suggests (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>), it is possible that there is a negative interaction between omega 3 fats and an angina medication which would outweigh other beneficial effects of omega 3s. However, they state: 'Fish oil could interact adversely with drugs taken by angina patients... There was no evidence of such interactions; indeed, beta-blockers appeared to interact favourably with fish in this study.'</P>
<P>
<B>Omega 3 dose</B>
<BR/>Apart from slightly different inclusion criteria and the longer follow up time for DART 2, it is very similar in design and implementation to the DART 1 study (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>), which showed a reduction in mortality for men advised to take more oily fish after a myocardial infarction. Both DART studies were conducted in the same geographical area, with the same first investigator, a similar factorial design (DART 1 also randomised to low fat and/or high fibre advice, DART 2 also randomised to increased fruit and vegetable intake), and similar system of randomisation. In DART 1 compliance to the oily fish advice was assessed by a 7 day weighed food diary of a random sub-sample, and indicated intake of 2.5g/week EPA in the intervention group, compared with 0.8g/week EPA in the control. In DART 2 a postal dietary questionnaire sent out six months after inclusion suggested that dietary EPA intake increased to 3.0g /week in the intervention group and 0.8g /week in controls, so compliance appears similar despite rather less intensive dietary advice in DART 2 (Ness A, personal communication). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Dietary fish or capsules</B>
<BR/>In DART 1 participants were initially advised to eat more oily fish, and those who were unwilling to eat the fish recommended were encouraged to take fish oil capsules (three MaxEPA capsules per day or 0.5g EPA/day). This was also true in DART 2, but around a third of the DART 2 participants were directly randomised to MaxEPA, without being given advice to eat oily fish. Subgrouping to identify any differences in outcome between those randomised to dietary fish advice, and those randomised to fish oil capsules, showed worse adjusted hazard ratios for those randomised to capsules, although they are not encouraging for either group, all deaths, dietary fish HR 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.37) , fish oil hazard ratio (HR) 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.54); sudden deaths, dietary fish HR 1.43 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.15), fish oil HR 1.84 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 3.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>). In contrast, subgrouping in this review (including the results from DART 2) suggested similar effects of dietary or supplemental interventions (total mortality, dietary advice the relative risk was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.44), capsule or oil supplements the relative risk was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.07); combined cardiovascular events, dietary advice the relative risk was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.07), capsule or oil supplements the relative risk was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.11). It does not seem likely that the differences in the effect of additional omega 3 in DART 2 differ from those in DART 1 because some participants were given capsules rather than advice, those in DART 2 given dietary advice fared much worse than DART 1 participants given dietary advice.</P>
<P>
<B>Small trial (publication) bias</B>
<BR/>Small trial bias is a possible explanation of the different results of DART 2 and the previous studies. There is good evidence that the pre-DART 2 body of studies were biased, as funnel plots strongly suggest that smaller studies show more favourable effects of omega 3 for total mortality and combined cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Perhaps DART 2 is simply redressing the balance. If we remove studies with fewer than 50 deaths, or 100 combined cardiovascular events, from the meta-analyses we find that the funnel plots appear less biased (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; Figure 04), however the summary estimate of the meta-analysis for total mortality remains similar, the relative risk was 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.10), while that for combined cardiovascular events remains non-significant, but suggests the possibility of a relative risk greater than one, the relative risk was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.31). However, both results show strong statistically significant heterogeneity, so heterogeneity is not due to the smaller trials alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection bias</B>
<BR/>DART 1 (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>) and GISSI-P (<LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>), the two large positive studies, were both run at a time when there was not much expectation of omega 3 being effective (both were factorial trials, and there was a greater expectation of the low fat arm in DART 1, and of the vitamin E arm in GISSI-P). DART 2 was run when expectations of the omega 3 arm were high. Health researchers usually want the best for the participants in their trials, and if there was any possibility of influencing the allocation process it might be expected that in DART 1 and GISSI-P those who seemed at most risk might have been preferentially allocated to low fat and vitamin E arms, and perhaps the weller participants advised on omega 3. However in DART 2, as expectations of omega 3 were high, participants most at risk would tend to enter the omega 3 arm. Assuming that there is actually a negligible effect of omega 3 fats on health, this situation might lead to the sort of results we see of these three large influential trials.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was coded as 'unclear' for DART 1 and 2. In both studies a dietitian took a dietary history, then opened a sealed envelope containing a card which indicated the diet to be advised. For GISSI-P however, allocation concealment was coded as 'done', since randomisation was by a centralised computer network. </P>
<P>One way of assessing whether selection bias occurred in any of the studies is to determine whether there were any consistent differences between the characteristics of the participants in the omega 3 and non-omega 3 arms of the trial. GISSI-P provides extensive tables of baseline characteristics, with no evidence that the group allocated to omega 3 supplements were more or less healthy at baseline than the control group or the vitamin E group. DART 1 participants given omega 3 advice were slightly less likely to smoke, have had a previous MI, angina or hypertension, but more likely to have cardiomegaly, lung congestion or lung oedema on x-ray, were less likely to be on beta-blockers, anti-anginals, anti-coagulants, aspirin or anti-platelets, digoxin or anti-arrhythmics, and more likely to be on anti-hypertensives other than beta-blockers, compared with those not given omega 3 advice. The differences were all less than 3% of the percentage in the control arm, except for previous MI, previous angina, cardiomegaly, and beta-blockers, and the picture does not show consistent advantage to those given omega 3 advice. This does not look like selection bias. Similarly, DART 2 participants given omega 3 advice or supplements were marginally less likely to have had a previous MI, or to be diabetic, more likely to be on beta-blockers, have a higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and higher cholesterol than those in the control group, but none of the differences amounted to a 3% difference, and there is no pattern of consistent advantage or disadvantage to the fish group. Selection bias does not appear to explain the differences in results between DART 2 and the other large trials.</P>

<BR/>Performance bias is a term for differential care provided to individuals within the trial according to their intervention group. This care could result from study personnel or other health carers giving extra advice, encouragement or treatment to those they perceive as not receiving the 'best' treatment, or it could result from participants who are receiving what they perceive as a very effective treatment not trying so hard with lifestyle changes or medication. In GISSI-P participants were not masked (there was no placebo capsule) and it is unclear whether health care providers were masked (unlikely if participants were not). In DART 1 and 2 neither participants nor healthcare providers were masked. This leaves the field open for the different expectations of the omega 3 intervention to have differing effects on adjuvant healthcare in all three trials. Information on weight, smoking, blood pressure, physical activity, prescribed medications and/or compliance with prescribed drugs might help us to understand whether this type of bias may have operated.</P>
<P>GISSI-P measured change in lipids at six months, and found that total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol rose slightly more in the omega 3 group (total cholesterol rose 8.4% vs 7.1%, LDL cholesterol rose 10.4% vs 7.3%), while HDL rose less in the omega 3 group (rise of 8.8% vs 9.3%). It is difficult to know whether this reflects the effects of the omega 3 fat, a more cavalier attitude to lipid lowering on the part of carers or participants, or both, but it does not suggest that those on omega 3 fats were better cared for in terms of lipid lowering. Pharmacological therapy appeared very similar among those on omega 3 supplements compared with those not allocated to omega 3 supplements at six months (anti-platelet drugs 87.9% vs 87.9%, ACE inhibitors 39.9% vs 41.9%, beta-blockers 41.2% vs 41.3%, lipid lowering drugs 28.3% vs 29.0%), again not supporting better concurrent treatment of those randomised to omega 3 supplements, although compliance is not reported. Those randomised to omega 3 fats were slightly more likely to be taking at least one portion of fruit (87.5% vs 87.0%) and vegetables (53.4% vs 52.8%) daily at six months, which may suggest that omega 3 participants were looking after themselves better, but the effect appears small.</P>
<P>DART 1 assessed food intake (7-day weighed) in a random sample of 25% of participants at six months, and found no differences in total energy, total fat or dietary fibre between those given omega 3 advice and those not. Those given fish advice ate slightly more protein (19% of calories vs 17% of calories), less carbohydrate (66% calories vs 68% calories) and less meat, meat products, cheese and eggs (as these were displaced by the fish). Weight was slightly lower in those randomised to omega 3 advice at baseline, and the differential between the two groups was maintained fairly consistently at six months and two years of the trial (both groups gaining about a kilogram). The proportion of current smokers fell in both groups from baseline, only slightly more in the group randomised to omega 3 advice (from 53.8% to 21.8%, a fall of 32.0%, in those on omega 3s and from 53.7% to 22.6%, a fall of 31.1%, in those not randomised to omega 3 advice. Prescription of anti-hypertensive drugs rose from 55.0 to 55.7% at six months and 59.0% at two years in those on omega 3 advice, while it fell from 58.0% at baseline to 57.9% at six months, then rose to 62.9% at two years in those not advised to take omega 3 fats. Use of anti-anginals fell slightly in the first six months of the study then increased dramatically at two years (omega 3 advice 46.5% at baseline, 45.7% at six months, 72.0% at two years; no omega 3 advice 47.2% at baseline, 46.7% at six months and 70.0% at two years). None of this suggests that those given omega 3 fat advice were treated, or acted, substantially differently from those not given such advice.</P>
<P>As results of the DART 2 trial have currently only been published in two papers, there is limited information about whether participants randomised to omega 3 advice received less good care from trialists, healthcare workers or looked after themselves less well. Self-reported intake of saturated fat six months after entering the trial was significantly reduced in all four arms of the trial, falls of 2.8 (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 4.6) g/dayay in the fish advice group, 3.1 (1.5 to 4.8) g/day in the fruit advice group, 3.9 (2.0 to 5.8) g/day in the fish and fruit group, and 3.5 (1.8 to 5.3) g/day in the control (sensible eating) group), as was total fat intake, falls of 5.2 (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 9.5) g/day in the fish advice group, 7.2 (3.6 to 10.9) g/day in the fruit advice group, 6.8 (2.4 to 11.1) g/day in the fish and fruit group, and 8.6 (4.6 to 12.7) g/day in the control (sensible eating) group). Similarly self reported total energy intake was reduced in all but the fish and fruit group, falls of 85 (95% confidence interval 12 to 158) kcal/day in the fish advice group, 84 (5 to 163) kcal/day in the fruit advice group, 60 (-35 to 156) kcal/day in the fish and fruit group, and 134 (40 to 228) kcal/day in the control group). While the fish plus fish and fruit groups combined appear to do less well than the fruit and sensible eating groups combined in terms of energy reduction and total fat reduction (where oily fish or supplements will have raised to the total fat and calorie intakes), this is not true for saturated fat reduction (which will have been altered less by fatty fish intake). </P>
<P>Self-reported lifestyle data were collected from 944 of the survivors a year after DART 2 ended (see Ness 2004, part of <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>). Significant differences between those given and not given fish advice were only seen for measures of fish or supplemental intake (62.9% of those given fish or omega 3 supplemental advice, and 41.8% of those not given such advice, were taking regular fatty fish or MaxEPA). Those given fish advice were on average taking the same amount of fruit and vegetables (364.6 vs 361.1 g/day) and alcohol (both 4.8 units per week) with a slightly lower weight (82.2 vs 82.7kg) than those not given fish advice. They were slightly (not significantly) less likely to smoke (17.6% vs 19.1%), and take aspirin (66.7% vs 68.6%), more likely to take lipid lowering drugs (39.2% vs 35.5%), while beta-blockers did not differ (36.9% vs 36.8%). </P>
<P>Overall, the indicators available to date do not suggest that those given omega 3 advice were less well cared for either by themselves or their healthcare providers. If performance bias is operating it is not obvious.</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias, detection bias</B>
<BR/>Attrition bias relates to differences in numbers or types of people dropping out from, or being excluded from the analysis of, the intervention and control arms of a study. Follow up in the two DART studies was virtually complete for mortality outcomes, so this does not explain the different results between these studies. Detection bias is about differential assessment of outcomes because of knowledge of the trial allocation, however determination of very definite outcomes (like death) are unlikely to be influenced by whether the outcome assessor knows someone is eating oily fish or not. What might possibly be influenced would be cause of death, but outcome assessors were masked to the interventions in both DART studies and GISSI-P, so this is unlikely to have caused the differences in results between the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<BR/>There are no clear reasons why DART 2 differs in its results from the bulk of the omega 3 studies. If we take the point estimate of the meta-analysis of the RCTs at low risk of bias as the best estimate we have of the effect of omega 3 fats on total mortality (the relative risk was 0.98), then while DART 1 and GISSI-P have point estimates on the positive side (0.71 and 0.86 respectively), DART 2 compensates with a point estimate on the negative side (1.15) and all three studies fall within the 95% confidence interval of this sensitivity analysis, the relative risk was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.36). It may be that the effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular disease is smaller than previously thought (if indeed the effect does exist). Alternatively it may be that effects in those who have had a myocardial infarction are protective of death, but the effects in men with angina and no infarction are not, which would explain the heterogeneity between the studies when DART 2 is added.</P>
<P>
<B>Levels of toxins<BR/>
</B>In this review we set out to discover the effect on health, if any, of the long term intake of toxins associated with oily fish, as well as with the oily fish itself. One distinguishing feature of DART 2 is that it has the longest follow up of all studies, so may provide useful information on these long term effects. Perhaps in DART 2 the cumulative harmful effects of the PCBs, dioxins and/or mercury, contained within oily fish and fish oils had time to develop and be expressed as illness. This interpretation has been supported by several cohort studies which have assessed relationships between oily fish, contaminants and cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="STD-zATBC-Pietinen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">zATBC Pietinen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-zKuopio-Rissanen-00" TYPE="STUDY">zKuopio Rissanen 00</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salonen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salonen 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>If the toxins carried by oily fish are counteracting the protective effect of the fish oil itself, we would expect an initial benefit of the omega 3 fats (as in the shorter term trials), followed by a period of neutrality and then harm as the toxins accumulate within adipose tissues, several years after initiation of omega 3. This is supported by the significant results of the meta-regression of relative risk of mortality vs study duration, where the relative risk of death in the omega 3 group compared with the control group rises over time, but this effect is lost once the DART 2 study is removed. A time-course analysis of the GISSI-P trial results (<LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>, see the Marchioli 2002 paper) suggests that the relative risk of death may have increased during the 42 months of the trial (although the confidence limits are very wide), from 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.97) at three months to 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.96) at six months, 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.86) at nine months, 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.96) at 12 months to 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.93) at 42 months - still protective late in the trial, but less so, in line with this review's meta-regression results. However, the survival curve of the DART 2 trial does not concur; survival appears less good for those encouraged to take omega 3 from only a year into the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>). If longer duration leads to greater harm then we could expect that this would occur more quickly in trials using higher doses of fish based supplements, but there are too few events in trials of high doses (all are 12 months or less in duration or include fewer than 100 participants) to assess whether this is the case. There is little evidence of a reduction in benefit, let alone harm, over the duration of the included studies. </P>
<P>The toxic load of oily fish and fish oil supplements varies widely depending on species, location, time of year, decade, and whether the fish are farmed or wild (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hites-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hites 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liem-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liem 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAFF-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAFF 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAFF-1998A" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAFF 1998A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAFF-1998B" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAFF 1998B</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAFF-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAFF 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USFDA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">USFDA 1995</LINK>). An assessment of fish oil supplements in 1994-5 found levels of total PCBs ranging from 'not detected' (where the limit of detection was 5 micrograms per litre) in oils from Australia, Japan, France, Austria, New Zealand and the UK, to 1132 micrograms per litre in a UK pharmaceutical grade salmon oil (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1998</LINK>). Some of these differences depend on how the oil is refined, and deodorisation appears to reduce contamination levels by about half (<LINK REF="REF-Hilbert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilbert 1998</LINK>). There is evidence that farmed salmon and wild sea fish stocks (used to feed farmed salmon) may be more contaminated in northern Europe than in North or South America (<LINK REF="REF-Hites-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hites 2004</LINK>, although this has been contested), but there are local areas of serious contamination of local fish stocks in North and South America, and parts of Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Cordier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hovinga-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovinga 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahaffey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahaffey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maurice_x002d_Bourgoin-00" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurice-Bourgoin 00</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salonen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salonen 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>We do not know the types of oily fish eaten in South Wales during the DART trials, or the levels of contamination that were present. Independent analysis of MaxEPA liquid in 2000-2002 (3ml/day MaxEPA was the supplement provided to participants in both DART1 and DART2 when they were unwilling to increase their oily fish intakes) suggests that this source was unlikely to be a major problem. Three ml daily would have produced an adult exposure of 0.2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bodyweight/day for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2002</LINK>), contrasting with estimated whole diet average intake of about 0.9 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bodyweight/day for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in 2001 (including dietary fish) or 7.2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bodyweight/day for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in 1982 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2003</LINK>). No independent UK data appear to exist for MaxEPA for the period during the DART 2 trial (1990 to 1999). The current provisional tolerable monthly intake set by the World Health Organization is just over 2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bodyweight/day (<LINK REF="REF-JECFA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">JECFA 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Overall it is difficult to know the levels of PCBs and dioxins in the oily fish and fish oils consumed by participants in any of our included trials. Environmental levels of PCBs and dioxins have been falling generally since action was taken to curb their manufacture and accidental production: lake sediment cores show peak levels in the 1970s and a gradual fall since then. If we do find that omega 3 fats are more protective against mortality in short than long term trials then this may not be due to toxins, but simply that people who would have died are being kept alive a little bit longer, death is delayed in some people for a few years, then catches up again.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison of RCT and cohort data</B>
<BR/>Cohort studies were included in the review to help us recognise any long term health effects of omega 3 fats, or any of the toxins which are commonly found in fish oil (including PCBs, dioxins and mercury). The reasoning is that cohort studies tend to be longer term than randomised controlled trials, and so may pick up harms or benefits that only accrue after many years. Also, even a short term cohort study may be reflecting longer term dietary patterns, so is more likely to spot longer term effects than is a trial. The disadvantage with cohort studies (and the reason we are not using them to assess the efficacy of omega 3 supplementation in cardiovascular disease) is the difficulty in separating out effects related to oily fish, fish oil or other omega 3 rich oil consumption, from other lifestyle factors associated with these eating patterns, so that causation is difficult to assess. </P>
<P>Cohort studies often do not give details of the characteristics of participants in their highest and lowest quantiles of omega 3 intake, but details are reported for five cohorts (HPFS, <LINK REF="STD-zHPFS-Ascherio-1995" TYPE="STUDY">zHPFS Ascherio 1995</LINK>; NHS, <LINK REF="STD-zNHS-Hu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">zNHS Hu 2003</LINK>; Kuopio IHD, <LINK REF="STD-zKuopio-Rissanen-00" TYPE="STUDY">zKuopio Rissanen 00</LINK>; NHSSN, <LINK REF="STD-zNHSSN-Egeland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">zNHSSN Egeland 2001</LINK>; Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS), <LINK REF="STD-zIWHS-Meyer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">zIWHS Meyer 2001</LINK>). We have data on comparable factors across at least two cohorts for the following, where people who take more omega 3 fats are consistently more likely to: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>be non-smokers (HPFS, NHS, Kuopio IHD, NHSSN, IWHS; adjusted for in HPFS, NHS, IWHS, Kuopio, stratified by in NHSSN)</LI>
<LI>be more active (HPFS, NHS, IWHS - not reported in NHSSN, similar in Kuopio IHD; adjusted for in NHS, IWHS, Kuopio)</LI>
<LI>have hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or a family history of CHD (HPFS, NHS - not reported in the others; all adjusted for in HPFS and NHS, not adjusted for in IWHS or NHSSN, Kuopio adjusted for blood pressure)</LI>
<LI>take dietary vitamins (HPFS, NHS - not reported in the others; NHS adjusted for vitamin E and multivitamin supplementation, HPFS, IWHS, NHSSN, Kuopio adjusted for neither, ) </LI>
<LI>to not have had a coronary event (Kuopio, NHSSN - not reported in IWHS, those with CVD excluded from HPFS and NHS; adjusted for in Kuopio, not in IWHS or NHSSN)</LI>

<LI>live in a city (IWHS, Kuopio - not reported in the others; adjusted for in IWHS and Kuopio, not in the others)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Age was generally almost identical in the upper and lower quantiles (data provided by NHS, IWHS, NHSSN and Kuopio; adjustment for age in HPFS, NHS, IWHS and Kuopio, not in NHSSN), as was BMI (in HPFS, NHS, IWHS and Kuopio, but was lower in those on high omega 3 intake for NHSSN; adjustment for BMI in HPFS, NHS, IWHS, Kuopio, not in NHSSN). HRT use was higher in those on high omega 3 intake in NHS, but similar in high and low omega 3 groups in the Iowa Women's Health study (both cohorts adjusted for hormone replacement therapy use, HPFS and Kuopio did not as they were men only, NHSSN did not). Sex was not relevant for HPFS, NHS, Kuopio or IWHS (all single sex cohorts), NHSSN stratified by sex.</P>
<P>Other factors adjusted for in one cohort only were: waist hip ratio, magnesium intake, marital status (IWHS); presence of diabetes, profession (HPFS); aspirin use, polyunsaturated /saturated fat ratio, duration of diabetes, medication for diabetes (NHS), platelet aggregation, hair mercury, socioeconomic status (summary score), fasting serum insulin, serum ferritin, and LDL cholesterol (Kuopio). Total energy intake was adjusted for by two cohorts, IWHS and Kuopio.<BR/> <BR/>Aside from the hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and family history of CHD, these factors indicate a health and social advantage to people taking higher levels of omega 3 fats - these are people who are likely to be healthier for a range of other reasons besides whether they take oily fish or omega 3 supplements. There are real theoretical difficulties in how to adequately adjust for this type of web of lifestyle advantage (encompassing social, educational, financial, dietary, fitness, smoking and treatment advantages) accompanying increased omega 3 intake - but if the adjustment is not adequate then those eating more omega 3 fats are likely to appear to be healthier than those who do not eat so much. Theoretically RCTs are the solution, separating out lifestyle patterns from omega 3 intake.</P>
<P>Any differences between RCTs and cohorts could be due to different doses of omega 3 fats used. These can be difficult to compare as doses are expressed in different ways in different studies (as quantities of EPA, or of EPA plus DHA, of all long chain omega 3 fats (including DPA) and with or without alpha-linolenic acid, or as weight of oily fish). In cohort studies differences may also be expressed as percentages of fatty acids within a cell fraction, or more crudely as groups of people who either generally do or do not have a weekly portion of oily fish. Included RCTs provide doses from less than 1g long chain omega 3 fats per day (<LINK REF="STD-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belluzzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-1_x0029_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 1) 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0028_DART-2_x0029_-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Burr (DART 2) 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_P-1999" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-P 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shimizu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shimizu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veale-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1994</LINK>) to over 5g per day (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connor-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Connor 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dehmer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dehmer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leaf-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leaf 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz_x002d_Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz-Meyer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-_x0028_HARP_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks (HARP) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>). The studies providing most of the outcome events provide less than 1g per day of long chain omega 3 fats. The difference between the upper intake and lower intake bands in the cohort studies also varies, and is often different in different analyses of the same cohort, but tend to be between 0.2 to 0.7g long chain omega 3 fats per day. So cohorts are assessing smaller differences in omega 3 fats over longer periods.</P>
<P>There are problems in dietary assessment of omega 3 intake, so that some people will be mis-classified by food frequency questionnaires (these are only as good as the amount of attention and importance they are given by the person completing them). It is possible that the best data will be from analyses of body fat fractions, rather than dietary assessments. Similar problems are encountered in RCTs where some participants will not take allocated supplements, and others in the control group may buy supplements or have a diet very high in omega 3 fats.</P>
<P>There is also a potential for reporting bias from cohort analyses. As it is possible to assess the effects of 'EPA' or 'DHA' or 'EPA+DHA' or 'EPA+DHA+DPA' or 'EPA+DHA+DPA+alpha-linoleic acid' or 'EPA+DHA+alpha-linoleic acid' or 'DHA+DPA' or 'regular supplement use' or 'regular oily fish meals' etc then there is a possibility that various combinations of the above will be assessed, but only those which look interesting (reach statistical significance) will be reported. (One cohort study also used ratios of fatty acids, but this was excluded from the review.) This can easily bias our understanding of 'statistical significance' and the likelihood of the importance of the relationships which are reported.</P>
<P>If the cohort studies give the same results as RCTs for short term outcomes (and the suggestion from GISSI-P and DART 1 have been that protection occurs within a one year period) then we can have more faith in the cohort studies reliably informing us about the longer term outcomes. RCTs tell us that there is no significant effect of omega 3 fats on total mortality, the relative risk was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.03, with significant heterogeneity) while cohort studies suggest significant protection, the relative risk was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88, no significant heterogeneity), so although the point estimates of both meta-analyses suggest protection by omega 3 fats there is disagreement about the size and statistical significance of that protection. The data are more similar for combined cardiovascular events, with both RCT and cohort data suggesting no significant effect, with similar point estimates and similar heterogeneity. 'Combined cardiovascular events' would be a useful outcome if omega 3 affects a variety of cardiovascular outcomes in a similar way, but may be misleading if omega 3 affects one specific type of cardiovascular event only (as the importance of this effect would be likely to be lost in the 'noise' of other unaffected events.</P>
<P>We are left with some uncertainty as to whether cohort studies are able to correct for lifestyle and health trends which may co-exist with greater intake of omega 3 fats, and so adequately assess risk of harms.</P>
<P>
<B>Potential harms of omega 3 fats<BR/>
</B>Animal and cohort studies of dioxins and PCBs suggest that cancers (and also sub-fertility in those exposed in utero) might be increased in humans with long exposure to contaminated fish oils, neurological deficits might result from increased mercury loads, and strokes might be promoted by the omega 3 fats themselves.</P>
<P>Cancer diagnosis is a long term outcome, where we might expect more information from cohort studies, but here neither meta-analyses of RCTs or cohorts show significant effects of omega 3 fats on cancer. This does not mean that there is no harmful effect as the numbers of events overall are small (fewer than 400 for RCTs, just over 800 in included cohort studies). Additionally, most trials that provided data on cancers provided mortality data rather than data on diagnosis. Clearly cancer deaths will take longer to occur than initial diagnosis in many cases so that we are even less likely to see an alteration in cancer deaths due to dioxins or PCBs during a trial, than we are in cancer diagnosis. No data were available on neurological problems, except that there were no significant effects seen on cognitive impairment (with only 100 events seen in the meta-analysable cohort study, but a significant protection of DHA (but not EPA) seen against Alzheimer's disease in <LINK REF="STD-zAlzheimer_x0027_s-Kyle-99" TYPE="STUDY">zAlzheimer's Kyle 99</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another postulated harm from increased omega 3 intakes is an increased stroke rate, but here again numbers of events were low (RCTs 243, cohorts 602) and no significantly harmful (or protective) effects were seen, although the point estimate for stroke from the RCT meta-analysis was greater than one, the relative risk was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.51).</P>
<P>Other health outcomes assessed in cohort studies were respiratory diseases, age-related macular degeneration and diagnosis of diabetes. There were fewer than 500 events in all meta-analyses except diagnosis of diabetes, where a omega 3 appeared to significantly increase the risk of diagnosis of diabetes. Interestingly an RCT (which provided alpha-linolenic acid) reported on diabetes diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Natvig-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Natvig 1968</LINK>) and with only 21 events suggests an almost significant protective effect of omega 3 fats. It is unclear whether this contradiction is due to different omega 3 sources, confounding, or the different time scales. No other outcomes showed significant associations except for early menarche, where higher omega 3 intake strongly correlates to early menarche. Thus the cohort studies provide no indication of onerous harmful effects of increased omega 3 intake from fish or vegetable oil sources, but data are lacking on important outcomes such as neurological status.</P>
<P>
<B>Strengths and weaknesses of this review.<BR/>
</B>We believe that a study by Singh et al is due to be withdrawn by the British Medical Journal (<LINK REF="REF-Retraction-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Retraction 2004</LINK>). For this reason we are unclear about the quality of the Singh study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>, which is by the same first author, but was not published in the BMJ). As this study is excluded in the sensitivity analyses, which remove all studies not considered at low risk of bias, we feel that it is even more important to ensure that any results are supported by the sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>This review assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's test, but assessment using the newly developed I<SUP>2</SUP> test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) would have altered our understanding of the degree or statistical significance of heterogeneity present in some analyses. For example, the main analysis where all RCT data on mortality is pooled has a p value of 0.04 suggesting statistically significant heterogeneity, but the I<SUP>2</SUP> value is 42%, a figure that might make us feel happier about pooling the studies (as it represents 'moderate' heterogeneity). In this case we might accept more readily that there is little effect of omega 3 fats and worry less about the differences between the DART 2 study and the other major omega 3 trials.</P>
<P>
<B>New trials</B>
<BR/>There are plans for trials, or trials underway, involving 21000 people with diabetes or glucose intolerance (<LINK REF="STD-AFORRD" TYPE="STUDY">AFORRD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASCEND" TYPE="STUDY">ASCEND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORIGIN" TYPE="STUDY">ORIGIN</LINK>), over 900 people with arrhythmias (<LINK REF="STD-DISAFF" TYPE="STUDY">DISAFF</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOFA" TYPE="STUDY">SOFA</LINK>), 8000 people with heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-GISSI_x002d_HF" TYPE="STUDY">GISSI-HF</LINK>), over 18000 people with hyperlipidaemia (<LINK REF="STD-JELIS" TYPE="STUDY">JELIS</LINK>), 15000 people at high risk of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="STD-Risk-and-Prevention" TYPE="STUDY">Risk and Prevention</LINK>) and 180 people with heart disease (<LINK REF="STD-OLIVE" TYPE="STUDY">OLIVE</LINK>), see table of characteristics of ongoing studies. When these trials report we should understand the effects of omega 3 fats on morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes, heart failure, hyperlipidaemia and arrhythmias, and this data will go some way to informing us of the effects of supplemental omega 3 fats over longer periods (both <LINK REF="STD-JELIS" TYPE="STUDY">JELIS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Risk-and-Prevention" TYPE="STUDY">Risk and Prevention</LINK> will follow up for 5 years), in people with heart failure and in lower risk people.</P>
<P>It is not clear that dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats reduce or increase total mortality, combined cardiovascular events, or cancers in people at high, moderate or low risk of cardiovascular disease. Neither were robust significant effects seen for any secondary outcome events. </P>
<P>The lack of significantly reduced total mortality, cardiovascular events, or cancers does not rule out an important effect of omega 3 fats, as numbers of events reported from robust high quality trials are small. </P>
<P>There is no clear evidence that omega 3 fats differ in their effectiveness according to initial level of risk of cardiovascular disease, dietary or supplemental omega 3 sources, fish or plant omega 3 sources, dose of fish-based omega 3 fats or presence or absence of a placebo. There was not enough evidence to assess the effect of proportion of EPA in plasma or membrane fats. There is a suggestion that a short term benefit of omega 3 fats may after several years become a harm, but the evidence for this is not consistent.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>It is not clear that dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats reduce or increase total mortality, combined cardiovascular events, or cancers in people with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease or in the general population. Neither were robust significant effects seen for any secondary outcome events. As no significantly increased risks of any events (total mortality, cancers, strokes) were seen there is no need for people to stop eating oily fish or taking supplemental sources of omega 3 fats if they are currently doing so.</P>
<P>As US, UK and international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kris_x002d_Etherton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kris-Etherton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998</LINK>) currently encourage people who have had a myocardial infarction to take more omega 3 fats, and the trials of people who have had myocardial infarctions support this, we suggest that this continues at present but that the evidence should be regularly reviewed as new trials are published. It is probably not appropriate at present to recommend increased omega 3 intakes for people who have angina but have not had a myocardial infarction, but again this may be incorrect and the evidence should be kept under review. </P>
<P>Independent analyses of the levels of toxins in named brands of fish oil supplements and oily fish sold for food should be more widely available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further high quality trials (with adequate allocation concealment, prespecified cardiovascular endpoints including sudden cardiac death, and blinding of participants and health providers) are needed to examine any protective effect of omega 3 fats for those at increased cardiovascular risk, to run for long enough to assess long term events (ideally beyond four years), and to report putative associated harms (including cancer diagnosis, different types of stroke, and neurological status). It is hoped that these issues will have been incorporated into the large studies currently being planned and underway and that further data will be available in the next few years.</P>
<P>At present almost no RCT data exist on health outcomes in healthy populations, this would be a fruitful area for further research, but large and expensive trials would be needed. Trials of ALA, oily fish and (concentrated) supplemental long chain omega 3 fats are needed, at present most ongoing trials appear to be of supplemental long chain omega 3 fats. The association between exposure to fat soluble toxins from fish and risk of MI or CHD should also be examined.</P>
