<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:31:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Intradialytic hypotension (IDH), which is caused by a decrease in blood volume, is a common complication of haemodialysis treatment. It is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure with symptoms of nausea, sweating, cramping, or dizziness and causes much discomfort to the patient. IDH is managed by giving fluids to the patient. These can include saline, albumin or other fluids such as gelatins and starches. Because albumin is a relatively rare and expensive blood product, we asked if albumin had an advantage over other fluids to treat IDH. We found one trial comparing albumin to normal saline; no trials were found comparing albumin to other fluids used to treat hypotension. This trial showed no difference between albumin and normal saline in all outcomes except for the amount of additional saline given, which was less in the group treated with albumin. We concluded that normal saline should be the first choice for treating IDH.</P>

<P>Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in 20% to 55% of haemodialysis sessions and is more frequent among patients on long-term haemodialysis. Symptomatic IDH is generally defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 10 mm Hg or a systolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, with symptoms such as cramps, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.

<P>One double blind randomised crossover trial met the inclusion criteria and compared 5% albumin to normal saline in patients with a previous history of IDH.
 Results from 45 assessable participants did not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference between 5% albumin and normal saline in the primary outcome measure of percentage target ultrafiltration achieved, nor in 11/12 secondary outcomes. Additional (unblinded) saline was given less often when 5% albumin was used compared with saline (16% versus 36%, P = 0.04). However, the volume of additional fluid administered was similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in the nursing time required to treat IDH and the time to restore BP.

<P>No randomised or controlled trial was identified comparing albumin to crystalloids (other than normal saline) or non-protein colloids, or a combination of both, in the treatment of symptomatic hypotension during dialysis. One double blind crossover RCT in 45 assessable patients showed that 5% albumin is not superior to normal saline for the treatment of symptomatic hypotension in maintenance haemodialysis patients with a previous history of IDH. Given the cost and relative rarity of albumin use compared to saline, saline should be first line of therapy for treatment of IDH in stable dialysis patients<B>.</B>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:31:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in 20% to 55% of haemodialysis sessions and with increasing frequency over time. IDH can result from an excessive rate or volume of ultrafiltration. Other contributing factors include left ventricular dysfunction, reduced cardiac output due to drugs or co-morbid conditions, autoimmune disorders, or reduced vascular tone. Components of the dialysis procedure, including the effects of low calcium and low sodium in dialysates or bio-incompatible dialyser membranes, may also be contributors to IDH (<LINK REF="REF-Emeli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emeli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knoll-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knoll 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sande-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sande 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Sande-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Sande 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Symptomatic IDH is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 10 mm Hg or a systolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, with symptoms such as cramps, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2003</LINK>). IDH may affect health-related quality of life and usually requires the administration of intravenous fluids in addition to increased medical and nursing care. It may cause early termination of dialysis resulting in inadequate fluid removal and reduced efficacy of the dialysis therapy. More serious complications such as cardiac or cerebral ischaemia may also develop (<LINK REF="REF-Emeli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emeli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knoll-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Knoll 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sande-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sande 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Sande-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Sande 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>IDH is managed pre-emptively or acutely. Pre-emptive strategies include using higher concentrations of sodium, calcium and bicarbonate in the dialysate solution. The temperature of the dialysate can also be lowered to increase myocardial contractility and peripheral vasoconstriction, the ultrafiltration rate can be closely regulated, or the time on dialysis or cardiovascular tolerance can be increased with sequential ultrafiltration. Pharmaceutical interventions include withholding antihypertensive medications before each treatment, or administration of alpha-adrenergic agonists, mannitol or sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>IDH is managed acutely by volume expansion through the intravenous administration of fluids. Fluids most commonly used for managing IDH include normal saline, hypertonic saline, dextran, pentastarch, and albumin (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Albumin is a human blood protein extracted from plasma. It is reconstituted with water to reflect normal blood osmolality and used clinically to replace lost plasma volume. As a protein, it carries the risk of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. As a human blood product, it carries the risk of viral disease transmission (for example hepatitis A, parvovirus) and prion disease transmission (for example Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease). In 2005 to 2006, albumin cost approximately CAD 66 per 25 grams. In a pilot study of albumin use in British Columbia (Canada), use of albumin for IDH accounted for approximately 19% of total in-hospital albumin use (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent controversies have surrounded the use of albumin in specific indications. A 1998 Cochrane review, 'Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients' (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 1998</LINK>), examined the safety of fluid resuscitation in patients with hypovolaemia, burns, and hypoproteinaemia by comparing albumin to no albumin or to crystalloid. The original review included 30 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with variable duration from one day to an unspecified duration and found an increase in mortality with the use of albumin as compared to crystalloid solutions in 1419 patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) of death with albumin administration was 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.23). The pooled difference in the risk of death with albumin was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%) with a fixed-effect model. However, the updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Albumin-Review-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albumin Review 2004</LINK>)<B> </B>included the SAFE trial (N = 6997) (<LINK REF="REF-SAFE-Study-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAFE Study 2004</LINK>), which received 91% of the weight, and found the RR of death with albumin administration was not significantly different from that with crystalloids (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10). In the <LINK REF="REF-SAFE-Study-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAFE Study 2004</LINK>, patients admitted to the ICU were randomised to receive either albumin (N = 3497) or normal saline (N = 3500) for intravascular resuscitation. The primary outcome measure was death from any cause during a 28-day period after randomisation. There were 726 deaths in the albumin group as compared with 729 deaths in the saline group (RR of death 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.87).There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with new, single-organ or multiple-organ failure; number of days spent in the ICU; days spent in the hospital; and days of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Clinical alternatives to albumin infusion include crystalloids and non-protein colloids. Crystalloid solutions are fluids that contain a combination of water and electrolytes that approximates plasma osmolality. These include isotonic solutions such as normal (serum osmotic) saline and Ringer's lactate; and hypertonic solutions including 1.8%, 3%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% sodium chloride solutions. Colloid solutions include larger, complex molecules formulated to reflect normal serum osmotic pressure. Non-protein, synthetic colloids include dextrans, gelatin-based products, and complex starches such as pentastarch. The cost of the synthetic non-protein colloid pentastarch was CA$84 per litre in 2005 to 2006, for example; and crystalloids were much cheaper than albumin with normal saline costing CA$1 per litre.</P>

<P>Conference proceedings, abstracts and poster presentations often do not provide sufficient details to determine the validity or quality of the study or its findings. The latter requires analysis of how the trial was conducted and how the results were analysed. That is, without publication, safety and efficacy claims may not be replicable or non-refutable. We were to carry out sensitivity analyses based on publication type (full text versus abstract only). Adverse effects were to be tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques as they are likely to be different for the various agents used. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Albumin versus normal saline</HEADING>
<P>One study comparing albumin to normal saline met the inclusion criteria for this review. The study was a double blind, randomised three-period crossover trial conducted at one centre (the Ottawa Hospital). Eligible patients were adults who underwent haemodialysis treatments at the Ottawa Hospital for a minimum period of three months and who had at least three episodes of IDH in the 60 days preceding enrolment into the study. Patients with known sensitivity to albumin were excluded. Seventy-two patients were randomised to one of two treatment sequences, 37 to treatment sequence 1 and 35 to treatment sequence 2. Patients in sequence one received 5% albumin to treat the first episode of IDH, the second and third dialysis sessions with IDH were treated with normal saline. Patients in sequence two received normal saline to treat the first dialysis session with IDH, the second and third dialysis sessions with IDH were treated with 5% albumin.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was the percentage of the target ultrafiltration achieved, which was defined as the actual ultrafiltration volume divided by the target ultrafiltration volume. Target ultrafiltration volume was the difference between the pre-dialysis weight and the dry weight. Actual ultrafiltration was the difference between the pre-dialysis and post-dialysis weights.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures were post-dialysis systolic and diastolic BP, volume of study fluid used, time to restore BP, total nursing time to treat hypotensive episodes (defined as the time from onset of symptomatic hypotension until the BP was restored and the patient no longer needed one-to-one attention), treatment failures (defined as the inability to restore BP with 750 mL of the study fluid); recurrent symptomatic hypotension, and the use of other interventions to treat hypotension (such as unblinded saline administration).</P>
<P>Of the 72 patients randomised, 27 patients were not assessable because they had no episode (N = 17: sequence one N = 11, sequence two N = 6) or one or two episodes (N = 10: sequence one N = 3, sequence two N = 7). Baseline characteristics were presented for the assessable patients only (N = 45); however, the authors stated that the randomised groups were well-balanced with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics.</P>
<P>To determine sample size, a chart review was conducted to determine the mean (SD) of the percentage of target ultrafiltration achieved with and without hypotension. From an informal survey of nephrologists it was determined that the minimum increase in percentage of target ultrafiltration that would change practice was 0.07. Assuming this minimal clinically important difference, a total of 42 patients needed to be evaluable. There were 45 patients in the final analysis, which was determined to be adequate to achieve statistical significance.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a summary of results by outcome hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>This RCT of 5% albumin versus normal saline for the treatment of IDH in maintenance haemodialysis patients showed no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome measurement of percentage of target ultrafiltration achieved and in 11 of 12 secondary outcome measurements. The P value was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. There were no reported withdrawals and no deaths. There were no significant carry-over (P = 0.38) or period effects (P = 0.32). Thus, the results of this uniformly negative trial does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between 5% albumin and saline.</P>
<P>A secondary analysis was also performed, on all patients who received at least one blinded study fluid (N = 55), with a similar result to the primary analysis.</P>
<P>Additional (unblinded) saline was given less often when 5% albumin was used compared with saline (16% versus 36%, P = 0.04). However, the volume of additional volume used was similar whether 5% albumin or saline was administered: 231 mL (136 mL) versus 260 mL (214 mL) (P = 0.41). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. </P>
<P>One argument for the use of albumin has revolved around time saving in restoring BP in IDH. In this trial, there were no significant differences in the nursing time required to treat IDH and the time required to restore BP.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key appraisal issues</HEADING>
<P>This is a well-conducted trial using a complex three-period crossover design. Crossover trials are suited to investigating treatments for chronic diseases where there is no hope for cure but a hope of moderating effects on the disease or, in this case, moderating the effects of a procedure. Certain therapies, those that have rapid and dramatic effects, also appear to be more suitable for crossover trials than therapies which have more persistent effects (<LINK REF="REF-Senn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senn 1993</LINK>). In this trial, it appears that the choice of a crossover design was appropriate for studying the rapid treatment effects of albumin and saline for IDH in stable dialysis patients.</P>
<P>Carry-over, or the period of treatment interaction, is considered to be an unresolved problem of crossover trials. Although there are tests for carry-over, the reader is warned to be cautious about these tests as they are impossible to interpret independently of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Senn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senn 1993</LINK>). The authors tested for carry-over and period effects at the request of the editors, and results were non-significant. This is further supported by the nature of the three-period design, modelled on the Jones and Kenward crossover designs, in that it is intended to mitigate carry-over and period effects so that they are not significant confounders (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The baseline characteristics in this trial are defined according to patients randomised to sequence one or two. However, the results are presented as the albumin 5% group and normal saline group. Since patients in both sequence one and two receive albumin as well as saline, treatment results include combining patients from both groups. In consultation with the author it was determined that patients are only compared to themselves, thus the unit of analysis is the patient and the denominator is 45 for both the albumin 5% group and the normal saline group (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). Patients acting as their own controls eliminates between patient variability and increases the power and efficiency of the trial.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:32:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-05 10:32:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>No randomised or controlled trials were identified comparing albumin to crystalloids (other than normal saline), non-protein colloids, or a combination of both in the treatment of symptomatic hypotension during dialysis. Therefore there is insufficient evidence from randomised or controlled trials to support that albumin provides a therapeutic advantage over crystalloids or non-protein colloids in the treatment of symptomatic hypotension during dialysis. One double blind randomised crossover RCT in 45 assessable patients showed that 5% albumin is not superior to normal saline for the treatment of symptomatic hypotension in maintenance haemodialysis patients with a previous history of IDH. Given the cost and relative rarity of albumin compared to saline, saline should be first-line therapy for treatment of IDH in stable dialysis patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-30 17:13:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Albumin may be used as prophylaxis for the preservation of blood volume and BP during haemodialysis in patients thought to be at risk of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Sande-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Sande 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sande-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sande 1999</LINK>). Since this may be a relatively high use area for albumin, RCTs comparing albumin to crystalloids or non-protein colloids are needed to determine if there is a role for albumin as prophylactic therapy to prevent the reduction in osmolality during dialysis. Further, If a clinician requires a colloid for treatment of IDH, randomised trials comparing the efficacy of non-protein colloids such as pentastarch versus albumin may be useful from a cost and albumin sparing perspective. Finally, it is not known if albumin confers a therapeutic advantage over crystalloids or other colloids in haemodialysis patients with rare episodes of hypotension.</P>

<P>5% albumin and normal saline were placed in identical 250 mL bottles. All bottles were tightly wrapped with foil so that the contents could not be seen. Plastic intravenous tubing covered with an opaque sleeve was supplied with each bottle, a small amount of multivitamin solution was added to the saline so that it was identical in colour to albumin. Participants, investigators, research nurses, dialysis nurses, and attending physicians were blinded to the coding of the study solutions. The investigators remained blinded until the analysis of the primary outcome was completed. No attempt was made to judge the success of blinding by asking patients or study personnel which solution was given</P>
