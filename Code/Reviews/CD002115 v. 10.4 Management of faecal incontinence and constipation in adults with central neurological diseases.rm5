<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:28:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individuals with central nervous system disease or injury have a much higher risk of loss of bowel control and severe constipation than other people. This is called neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). It can be very difficult to treat constipation without causing bowel leakage, or to prevent bowel leakage without causing constipation. The time spent on emptying the bowel is nearly always much greater for these individuals. Bowel problems like this cause a lot of anxiety and distress and can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer them. This review of research about NBD could be of interest to individuals with any damage to the central nervous system caused by disease or injury, or present at birth, which has a long term effect on how their bowel works.</P>
<P>While there is a great deal of information on the causes of NBD, there are few studies that focus on how to practically manage the problem. Currently the usual advice is to have a good fluid intake, a balanced diet, as much physical exercise as is practical and a regular planned bowel routine. A bowel routine may include use of oral laxative medicines, suppositories or enemas; abdominal massage; digital rectal stimulation and digital evacuation of stool. The steps used will depend on the needs of each individual and some degree of trial and error is usually needed to achieve a satisfactory routine.</P>
<P>Only research studies where participants were allocated to either the control group (who received either no intervention or usual care) or the treatment group by chance (called randomisation) were included in this review as these studies provide the most reliable evidence. Fifteen new studies have been added in this update. Five have been removed because the drugs the studies reported on (cisapride and tegaserod) have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available. Most of the 20 randomised studies in this review included very small numbers of participants and the study reports did not always give the information needed to be sure that the study findings were reliable.</P>
<P>Some oral laxatives were found to improve bowel function including psyllium, a stool-bulking laxative (one study), and an isosmotic macrogol (one study), which were both studied in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Some suppositories and micro-enemas used to help the bowel to open produced faster results than others (three studies) and the timing of suppository use may affect the response of the bowel (one study). Digital evacuation of stool may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one study). The use of transanal irrigation in individuals with spinal cord injury improved bowel control, constipation and quality of life measures (one study). Three studies found that abdominal massage was helpful in reducing constipation. One study found that patients may benefit from even one educational contact with a nurse.</P>
<P>This review shows that there is still remarkably little research on this common problem which is so important to patients. The research evidence found by the review is generally very poor because the way the studies were carried out and reported means that the results are not reliable. It is not possible to make recommendations for care based on these studies. Managing NBD will continue to rely on trial and error until more high quality studies with larger numbers of participants and which examine the most important aspects of this problem are carried out.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:26:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-22 10:54:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:26:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:26:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-01-09 09:35:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of pre-specified outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 14:55:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty trials involving 902 people were included.</P>
<P>Oral medications</P>
<P>There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) -2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.3 to -1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92).</P>
<P>Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review.</P>
<P>Rectal stimulants</P>
<P>One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol-based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil-based (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P &lt; 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P &lt; 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository.</P>
<P>Physical interventions</P>
<P>There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score).</P>
<P>One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25).</P>
<P>There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method.</P>
<P>Other interventions</P>
<P>In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one-off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool.</P>
<P>Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:28:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other.</P>
<P>There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulk-forming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase-anticholinergic drug combination (neostigmine-glycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone). However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger well-designed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:30:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The focus of this review is the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:29:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Loss of voluntary control over bowel function and constipation frequently accompany central nervous system (CNS) conditions. People need to be able to control their bowel function to enable them to participate in all areas of adult life. Working, studying, leisure activities, travelling, and developing and maintaining personal relationships may all be affected by loss of voluntary bowel control. However, it is not simply loss of voluntary control that impacts on the lives of affected individuals. Even in individuals who rarely experience frank incontinence, fear of incontinence may result in reduced social activity and isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Emmanuel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmanuel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Byrne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glickman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glickman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiens 1997</LINK>). Additionally, neurogenic bowel is associated with haemorrhoids, abdominal pain, faecal impaction, rectal bleeding, rectal prolapse, anal fissure, abdominal bloating, nausea, autonomic dysreflexia and prolonged evacuation, which all impair quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Correa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Looze-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Looze 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Han-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harari-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harari 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menter 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hospitalisation for impaction, megacolon, constipation and volvulus is more than twice as frequent in adults with neurological diseases than in individuals without neurogenic bowel dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Sonnenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonnenberg 1994</LINK>). The often time-consuming and arduous active management of the neurogenic bowel that is required to avoid constipation and incontinence also diminishes quality of life. The issue of incontinence and its management impacts on partners and other family members, and hospital and community health services.</P>
<P>With the increase in the length of survival after the development or onset of some neurogenic conditions, the use of healthcare resources is likely to increase in the coming years. While effective management may have a significant cost, both to the individual in terms of impact on his or her ability to engage with their community and to the community health and social services, ineffective management may have even higher costs in terms of reduced integration, increased carer attendance, laundry costs and ultimately stoma surgery or admission to a residential care setting with significant incident and ongoing costs.</P>
<P>Trauma and disease of the CNS affect bowel function in a number of ways depending on the location and severity of the damage. This damage may result in partial or complete loss of sensory and voluntary motor function in the ano-rectum and the pelvic floor. Normal modulation of the intrinsic nervous system of the bowel by the CNS is disrupted resulting in altered blood flow, enzyme secretion, and water and electrolyte transport in the gastrointestinal tract. While the intrinsic system itself usually remains intact, except in Parkinson's disease, the lack of CNS modulation results in dysmotility, increased colonic transit time and constipation. The broader effects of disability, including loss of mobility, spasticity, muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of independence in toileting, in some cases related to cognitive impairment and the use of drugs whose actions may adversely affect bowel function, all contribute to neurogenic bowel dysfunction.</P>
<P>The prevalence of bowel dysfunction in people suffering from neurological diseases is much higher than in the general population. While not all people with neurological conditions experience neurogenic bowel dysfunction, it is a major problem for many.</P>
<P>Estimates of the prevalence vary but faecal incontinence has been reported in:</P>

<P>Faecal incontinence and constipation frequently coexist in people with central neurological diseases. The broad range of reported prevalences in the literature is due to the varying definitions used for faecal incontinence and constipation and to the selection of differing populations with a range of disabilities.</P>
<P>Despite the significance of faecal incontinence and constipation to individuals who suffer from central neurological conditions, high quality research evidence to support neurogenic bowel management remains scanty. Consequently the development of bowel management programmes for this patient group continues to rely on tradition and experience, or trial and error.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:30:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An effective bowel management programme for a person with a neurogenic bowel involves the modulation of stool consistency, promotion of stool transit through the bowel, and effective reflex or mechanical evacuation of stool from the rectum at an appropriate time and place (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2012b</LINK>). Such care is pre-emptive; bowel function is manipulated so that effective evacuation of the rectum occurs at a pre-specified and predictable time, when appropriate resources such as carer assistance are available. By emptying the bowel at a chosen time incontinence is avoided; and regular emptying reduces the risk of impaction of stool due to constipation.</P>
<P>The strategy most commonly employed, therefore, is the establishment of a routine. Postal questionnaire data suggest an association between irregular or infrequent bowel management and constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2009</LINK>). Bowel care is conducted at a set frequency and time of day and may include stimulation of the gastrocolic reflex, abdominal massage, rectal stimulants, digital rectal stimulation to produce reflex evacuation of stool, and digital removal of stool (<LINK REF="REF-Krassioukov-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krassioukov 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paris-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paris 2011</LINK>). Oral laxatives, which include osmotic, bulk-forming and stimulant varieties may be recommended if required. It is sometimes suggested that senna use may lead to reduced colonic activity. While robust evidence is lacking to support this concern, long term use of senna should be avoided if possible (<LINK REF="REF-Gattuso-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattuso 1994</LINK>). Individuals are often advised to modulate intake of dietary fibre and to take adequate fluids in order to influence stool consistency. However, there is scant evidence of the effectiveness of any of these interventions in individuals with any neurogenic disease. This broad approach is referred to as conservative bowel management.</P>
<P>Each individual should have a bowel programme which is designed to meet their specific requirements, based on an assessment of their needs and abilities, social setting and the availability of resources, particularly carers (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2012b</LINK>). An effective programme may be difficult to achieve and may prove excessively time consuming, with obvious effects on quality of life.</P>
<P>Even when a programme is successful in avoiding incontinence and constipation, individuals may still be plagued with other symptoms including abdominal distension, pain and ano-rectal conditions such as haemorrhoids, fissures and rectal ulcers. Those with spinal cord injuries at or above the sixth thoracic vertebra are also vulnerable to autonomic dysreflexia, an abnormal sympathetic nervous system response to a noxious stimulus resulting in rapidly rising blood pressure with accompanying risk of brain haemorrhage and death; the response may be provoked by bowel management problems (<LINK REF="REF-Kavchak_x002d_Keyes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavchak-Keyes 2000</LINK>). The bowel programme should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2012b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where conservative methods of management are unsuccessful the choices remain limited. Biofeedback has been found to be of benefit in some individuals with multiple sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesel 2000</LINK>). The use of gut motility stimulants in patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction remains largely unexplored. Irrigation of the bowel may be undertaken via the anus, or through a surgically constructed irrigation stoma. While the latter has been most commonly reported in children (<LINK REF="REF-Dey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Driver-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 1998</LINK>), transanal irrigation, facilitated by the recent development of more sophisticated equipment, has been reported with increasing frequency in adults. Outcomes have been broadly positive though reliable identification of those individuals likely to benefit remains elusive. The significant number of people who stop using these methods over the long term merits further exploration (<LINK REF="REF-Faaborg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faaborg 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sacral nerve stimulation, or surgically implanted neuro-modulation, has been reported in case series to improve neurogenic bowel dysfunction in individuals with incomplete cauda equina (<LINK REF="REF-Gstaltner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gstaltner 2008</LINK>) and incomplete spinal lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Lombardi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombardi 2010</LINK>). However, the evidence is very limited and further study is required. Sacral anterior root stimulation techniques produce improvements in bowel dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Valles-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valles 2009</LINK>), although to date such devices are usually implanted primarily to address bladder dysfunction and their impact on bowel function is a useful by-product (<LINK REF="REF-Creasey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasey 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of colostomy in this context remains limited, but a number of cross-sectional studies conducted with spinal cord injured cohorts suggest that this approach can be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Branagan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branagan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2012a</LINK>), and indeed colostomy should be considered sooner than it is currently in the course of the individual&#8217;s journey with neurogenic bowel dysfunction.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:30:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neurogenic bowel management is comprised of a range of interventions from which a selection is usually combined in an individually designed programme or routine intended to modulate stool form or to prompt planned pre-emptive bowel evacuation, or both. The programme is repeated regularly, with sufficient frequency to prevent constipation and faecal incontinence. </P>
<P>Hence continence may be achieved through conservative methods such as emptying the bowel at a chosen time when resources for the activity are available (such as the availability of carers), thus minimising the risk that the bowel will open at another inopportune time resulting in faecal incontinence. To facilitate the success of this approach, stool form is modulated through dietary manipulation or use of oral laxatives depending on the type of bowel dysfunction (reflex or areflexic) and to promote the chosen method of evacuation (a firm stool is required for manual evacuation, while a soft formed stool is needed for stimulated reflex evacuation with pharmaceutical or digital rectal stimulation).</P>
<P>Bowel irrigation is thought to both stimulate colonic reflex activity and to act as a mechanical bowel washout. Irrigation must conform to the need for regularity and frequency, described above. Transanal irrigation of the bowel involves passing water into the bowel via the anus in a large enough volume to reach beyond the rectum (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2012b</LINK>). An antegrade continence enema uses a surgically created irrigation stoma constructed from the appendix or a segment of caecum to allow infusion of water for irrigation of the colon from the caecum towards the rectum. Rectal stimulation, manual evacuation of stool, and oral laxatives may also be required.</P>
<P>Prucalopride is a selective, specific 5-hydroxytryptamine4 (5-HT4) agonist targeting 5-HT or serotonin-4 receptors, which are involved in initiating peristalsis. It increases colonic motility, hastens transit, reduces symptoms and increases satisfaction in individuals with severe chronic constipation of non-neurogenic origin (<LINK REF="REF-Camilleri-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilleri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tack-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tack 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The precise mechanism by which sacral neuromodulation techniques can improve both faecal incontinence and constipation (and bladder function and neuropathic pain) has yet to be identified. Following placement of temporary wires and a successful trial period of two weeks with an external stimulator, permanent electrodes are placed on a sacral nerve (usually S2 or S3) under radiographic control and the stimulator is implanted. The implant provides continuous low level electrical impulses to the sacral plexus, influencing the anal canal, colon and pelvic floor; however, consistent changes in anal resting pressure and other manometric outcome measures have not been reported in the literature. How sacral neuromodulation impacts on or integrates with a bowel management programme has not been studied.</P>
<P>A sacral anterior root stimulator (SARS) is implanted primarily for neurogenic bladder dysfunction after spinal cord injury but it has been reported in case series to have beneficial effects on bowel dysfunction for many individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Binnie-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Binnie 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creasey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kachourbos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kachourbos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>). A stimulator is implanted and during open surgery electrodes are placed on the second, third and fourth sacral anterior nerve roots. The stimulator is triggered by a handheld external device and high voltage, short-lived stimulation can be applied several times daily to empty the bladder. The colon is stimulated simultaneously, resulting in increased colonic activity, reduced constipation, and sometimes defaecation during stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Chia-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valles-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valles 2009</LINK>). Implantation remains rare; just seven of more than 1330 respondents to a recent spinal cord injury bowel management postal questionnaire reported using a SARS for bowel management (<LINK REF="REF-Coggrave-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggrave 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intestinal stoma formation results in the diversion of faeces away from the rectum to a receptacle attached to the abdomen. The person no longer needs to evacuate stool from the rectum, resulting in much reduced expenditure of time on managing bowel dysfunction, eradication of faecal incontinence, and promotion of independence due to the location of the stoma on the abdomen. Constipation may persist, with many individuals requiring continued use of laxatives.</P>

<P>People 18 years of age or more with a central neurological disease and symptoms of faecal incontinence or constipation.</P>
<P>Neurological diseases are defined here as any disease with a pathological process directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Acute conditions with no chronic legacy are not included, nor are diseases affecting only the peripheral nervous system, whether involving the motor, sensory or autonomic nerves (for example pelvic floor neuropathy).</P>
<P>Faecal incontinence is defined as recurrent uncontrolled, involuntary, or unplanned passage of faecal material or flatus, for at least one month (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1999</LINK>). It causes staining, soiling or leakage onto underwear or a pad.</P>
<P>Constipation is defined as having two or more of the following: straining during at least 25% of defecations, lumpy or hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of ano-rectal obstruction or blockage, or  use of manual manoeuvres to facilitate evacuation in at least 25% of defecations (for example digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor), and fewer than three defecations a week. Loose stools should rarely be present without the use of laxatives. These criteria should have been fulfilled for the last three months prior to diagnosis, with symptom onset at least six months prior to diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Longstreth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longstreth 2006</LINK>). Small, unsatisfactory, inefficient or absent bowel movements during two or more attempts at toileting are also considered here as constipation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Prucalopride</HEADING>
<P>Two trials were found of prucalopride, a systemic enterokinetic drug which is a selective and specific 5-HT4 agonist targeting serotonin-4 receptors involved in initiating peristalsis. Medaer and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Medaer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Medaer 1999</LINK>) reported a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled phase II trial of prucalopride in patients with MS. The number of participants was not stated. Following a four week run-in period, session 1 of the study examined tolerability and safety with 1 mg of prucalopride or placebo once daily for 4 weeks; session 2 examined efficacy with 2 mg prucalopride or placebo daily for 4 weeks.</P>
<P>Krogh and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Krogh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krogh 2002</LINK>) reported a double-blind placebo-controlled phase II study of prucalopride. The study included 23 patients in a dose escalation study. A four week run-in period was followed by random allocation to placebo, prucalopride 1 mg or 2 mg groups for 4 weeks. The participants in the 2 mg prucalopride group were older at injury and older in age than the other groups. Bowel management in the run-in period and its outcomes were not described. Participants were required not to alter their diet and to refrain from the use of laxatives except in clearly defined circumstances and to a stated protocol.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Neostigmine-glycopyrrolate</HEADING>
<P>Two trials investigating the effects of neostigmine-glycopyrrolate on bowel evacuation were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Korsten-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Korsten 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosman 2008</LINK>). Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase drug which increases parasympathetic stimulation of the bowel. Glycopyrrolate, a selective anticholinergic agent, was added because it might antagonize the untoward side effects of neostigmine on the heart without interfering with its actions on the bowel.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Korsten-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Korsten 2005</LINK> reported evacuation of a radio-opaque oatmeal and barium mix in response to intravenous administration of 2 mg neostigmine or 2 mg neostigmine plus 0.4 glycopyrrolate or normal saline, administered in random order once in each participant on a different day, in 13 participants. No run-in period was reported. Individuals undertook their usual bowel care prior to the intervention and a 20 minute equilibration period was allowed following insertion of the porridge stool prior to delivery of the injection.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rosman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosman 2008</LINK> reported a study in which individuals received 2 mg neostigmine plus 0.4 glycopyrrolate intramuscularly for one week and normal saline as placebo intramuscularly for one week in random order, with a week of washout between the phases. A total of 21 episodes of bowel care were recorded in 7 participants. Participants continued their usual bowel care throughout. No preparation, run-in or follow-up was reported.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for these trials included use of bowel diaries; frequency, ease and duration of evacuation; evacuation of stool or not; stool consistency; modality of bowel evacuation; frequency of use of  digital rectal stimulation; digital evacuation of stool; suppositories and laxatives; time from suppository insertion to bowel movement; symptoms; side effects; gastric emptying; total and segmental colonic, oro-caecal and oro-anal transit time using hydrogen breath test, radio-opaque or carmine red markers; and presence of faecal impaction. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Korsten-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Korsten 2005</LINK>) used additional outcomes: amount of a 200 ml barium oatmeal paste evacuated from rectum, seen radiographically 30 minutes after infusion; time from injection to completion of bowel care; to first flatus; to beginning of bowel movement; to end of bowel movement; and total time for bowel movement including clean up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oral laxatives</HEADING>
<P>Three trials evaluated oral laxatives, two in individuals with Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zangaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zangaglia 2007</LINK>) and one in a mixed sample including 15 wheelchair bound institutionalised adults with MS (7), cerebral palsy (4), SCI (2) and brain injury (2) (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2005</LINK>). The study by Ashraf and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 1997</LINK>) was a placebo-controlled study of psyllium, a soluble fibre bulk-forming laxative aimed at absorbing water and increasing bulk to encourage normal peristalsis and bowel motility. Seven out of 12 potential participants who self reported constipation in the preceding six months were selected for inclusion if during the final week of a four week run-in period three or fewer bowel movements were reported on a standardised diary. Three people were allocated to psyllium 5.1 g daily, four to placebo for eight weeks followed by a four week washout period. Dietary habits were neither monitored nor modified during the treatment period. In particular, no attempt was made to control fibre intake.</P>
<P>Zangaglia and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Zangaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zangaglia 2007</LINK>) randomised 57 participants to 8 weeks of isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution (7.3 g in water) versus placebo (flavoured maltodextrine), both dissolved in 250 ml water twice daily. The length of the laxative free baseline was not specified. The macrogol dose could be varied between one and three sachets daily depending on stool form; patients were asked to keep their diet and fluid intake unchanged.</P>
<P>The study by Dahl and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2005</LINK>) included participants with and without dysphagia who were given 15 g daily of an inulin-fortified beverage versus standard modified starch-thickened beverages for three weeks.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for these trials included stool frequency, symptoms related to bowel function, total stool weight, colon transit time, ano-rectal manometry, frequency of enema or other rectal laxative administration, straining, stool consistency, diary cards and numbers of unused sachets of medication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Chinese medicines</HEADING>
<P>A trial of a Chinese medication was conducted by Huang and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>). They compared a Chinese mixture "qirong runchang oral liquid" with a different type of Chinese medicine, "yuchi runchang ointment", in 120 stroke patients. The trial mixture was received by 90 individuals, the control or alternative treatment by 30 individuals; they were randomised 3:1. The treatment was continued for two weeks and the response to treatment was evaluated at the end of treatment and two weeks later. Possible outcomes were defined as: "cure" where stool consistency and frequency was "normal" or returned to premorbid levels, "good" where there was significant improvement in stool consistency and frequency, "partial" where there was some improvement in frequency or consistency, or "no response".</P>
<P>Due to difficulties with obtaining a complete translation it was not possible to fully evaluate the methods or statistical methods of the Huang study. It was not clear if the control group was actually receiving standard care; they may have received an alternative therapy. Few outcome measures were used and the main rating scale was unvalidated. Both the treatment period and follow-up were of short duration. There was considerable variation in time since the stroke (range three days to 40 years).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rectal stimulants</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-House-1997" TYPE="STUDY">House 1997</LINK>), involving 15 people with SCIs, compared two rectal stimulant suppositories: a hydrogenated vegetable oil-based bisacodyl suppository (HVB) and a polyethylene glycol-based bisacodyl suppository (PGB). The analysis used timed events that divided the bowel care sessions into discrete intervals. The analysis also compared the trial groups in respect to: the need to use digital rectal stimulation, incontinence, and stool quantity. The trial included 10 people with upper motor neurone spinal cord lesions, with both subacute and chronic conditions, and with complete and incomplete spinal cord lesions.</P>
<P>Descriptions of withdrawals and dropouts were lacking. Investigators did not routinely record whether stool was present in the rectum. The involvement of a number of different nurses to administer the bowel programme might have introduced a source of variation in the delivery of care as well as in the recording and interpretation of findings. In addition, 10 individuals were treated with a docusate and glycerine mini-enema; this non-randomised study arm will not be further discussed in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Morning versus evening and mandatory versus optional suppository use</HEADING>
<P>Venn and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Venn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 1992</LINK>) compared four bowel programmes based on the use of suppositories and scheduled bowel care in consecutive individuals admitted to a rehabilitation unit following stroke. Forty-six of all 58 stroke patients admitted in the study period were assigned to one of four protocols: 1) mandatory morning suppository; 2) optional morning suppository if the patient had not had a bowel movement within the previous four hours; 3) mandatory evening suppository; 4) optional evening suppository if the participant had not had a bowel movement within the previous four hours.</P>
<P>The outcome was evaluated using a study-specific unvalidated efficiency rating (<LINK REF="STD-Venn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 1992</LINK>). This was determined by how long it took for the individual to achieve a bowel movement at the scheduled time for five consecutive days; the fewer days required, the higher the rating. The report did not include details of the characteristics of participants (for example age distribution, sex ratio, onset of disease, stage and severity of stroke, gastrointestinal symptoms, concomitant treatments). The type of suppository used was not described.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Stepwise protocol of least (for example massage) to most invasive (for example manual evacuation) interventions versus usual care</HEADING>
<P>Coggrave and colleagues (2010) randomised 68 individuals with chronic SCI to usual care or to a stepwise protocol which focused on greater use of less invasive interventions (for example massage) to reduce the need for oral laxatives and more invasive interventions (for example manual evacuation of stool), and to improve bowel management outcomes.</P>
<P>The outcome measures employed in this trial included time from bowel stimulation to evacuation, frequency of non-response to rectal stimulation, duration of bowel care, level of intervention required to instigate and complete evacuation, and frequency of faecal incontinence.</P>

<P>Three trials evaluated the impact of abdominal massage.</P>
<P>Emly and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Emly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Emly 1998</LINK>) randomly allocated 32 individuals with cerebral palsy or genetic conditions associated with abnormal muscle tone and learning disability to one of two groups. Each group received both the intervention and undertook usual care as a control phase, one group receiving the trial intervention first, the other receiving it second. A five day washout period was undertaken prior to participation in the study. The treatment and control phases were separated by a one week washout period. During washout periods all laxatives were withdrawn but enemas could be administered, if required, during all stages of the study.</P>
<P>McClurg et al (<LINK REF="STD-McClurg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClurg 2011</LINK>) randomised 30 individuals with MS to receive either weekly visits from a physiotherapist or weekly visits from a physiotherapist plus specific instruction on use of abdominal massage. The physiotherapy visit included discussion of clinical symptoms and lifestyle advice about diet, fluids, toilet positioning and exercise to control for the effect of contact with a healthcare professional. In addition, the intervention group received instruction in abdominal massage.</P>
<P>Jeon and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Jeon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jeon 2005</LINK>) explored the benefits of abdominal meridian massage in 31 individuals with stroke; the intervention group received massage but no further details were available regarding the methods used in the study.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for these trials included total and segmental transit time, frequency of evacuation, stool size and consistency, a constipation assessment scale, use of enemas, Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction score, MS impact score, bowel diaries and assessment of participant well-being.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Transanal irrigation</HEADING>
<P>Transanal irrigation in individuals with SCI was explored by Christensen and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2006</LINK>). Eighty-seven individuals were randomised to either 10 weeks of transanal irrigation using a specially designed system with a pump and self retaining balloon catheter (Peristeen, Coloplast, Denmark), used independently after training by a nurse, or to conservative bowel management. Participants undertook bowel care every day or every two days. Follow-up was undertaken weekly by a researcher not involved in recruitment and the teaching of participants. Data from the last four weeks were used in the analysis of the study findings.</P>
<P>Outcomes included the Cleveland Clinic constipation score, St Marks faecal incontinence score,  neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, modified American Society of Colorectal Surgeons Faecal Incontinence score, bowel function, influence of bowel function and management on daily activities and quality of life, duration of bowel care, and frequency of urinary tract infections.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Irritant-contact medication versus stimulant bowel medication versus mechanical evacuation procedure with tap water enema</HEADING>
<P>Cornell et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1973</LINK>) compared three different bowel programmes, all of which included an oral wetting agent (dioctyl), amongst 60 people with a recent SCI:</P>
<OL>
<LI>irritant contact bowel medication (Bisacodyl) orally and rectally;</LI>
<LI>stimulant bowel medication orally and rectally (anthracene, senna, glycosides); and</LI>
<LI>a mechanical evacuation procedure with a tap water enema, plus oral stimulant laxatives and oral bulking agent (psyllium and methylcellulose).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Very little information about the presence or absence of constipation and faecal incontinence prior to the study was provided. Evaluation of the bowel programme was performed subjectively by rehabilitation nurses. Data on patients' satisfaction were not collected. Nurses had the freedom to modify the bowel programme for participants if it was "ineffective"; no indication of the type of modifications made is given and hence the degree of compliance with the allocated protocol is unclear. The carmine red total gut transit time test was reported for only 14 participants. The reported levels of SCI indicated that remaining bowel function would have varied among participants. The participants also varied in the density of their injury (that is whether or not they had complete loss of sensory and motor function). The responses of these subgroups were not reported. There was no analysis of withdrawals and dropouts. There was no run-in period but data collection was conducted over a prolonged period for those who continued with their protocol.</P>
<P>The outcome measures that were employed in this trial included time from bowel stimulation to evacuation, frequency of non-response to rectal stimulation, duration of bowel care, level of intervention required to instigate and complete evacuation, and frequency of faecal incontinence.</P>

Eight participants used an abdominal belt embedded with electrodes wrapped around the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus during six bowel management episodes. Use of the belt was integrated with the individual's existing bowel regimen but was randomly activated in three of the six uses. The analysis considered time from activation to first stool and total time from activation to completion of bowel care confirmed by digital rectal examination.</P>

<P>Harari and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Harari-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harari 2004</LINK>) reported a trial involving 146 stroke patients comparing a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care. The intervention consisted of a one-off structured nursing assessment followed by targeted patient and carer education and treatment recommendations according to a pre-established protocol. A diagnostic summary and treatment recommendations were also provided to the treating physician or general practitioner (GP). The intervention that was tested included treatment recommendations based on an unvalidated protocol, and the targeted education or booklet was not described. The nurse conducting the intervention was not a specialist though she had received training and was supported by a medical colleague during the study.</P>
<P>The methodology did not allow the comparison of groups for important variables: physiological bowel status, diet, drug use, etc. The numbers of individuals allocated to the various management pathways in the treatment protocol were not given, nor was it stated whether participants continued with the recommended management protocol subsequent to the assessment or whether individual treatment pathways were equally effective.</P>
<P>One outcome measure was the percentage of bowel movements graded as normal by respondents; the grading system was not defined. Other outcome measures included the self reported number of bowel movements per week, number of bowel movements rated as normal, episodes of faecal incontinence, quality of life measures, and treatment and resource use.</P>

There was no change in other bowel care related parameters such as duration of bowel care, use of anal stimulation or digital evacuation, faecal incontinence or unproductive toilet visits. Changes in laxative and enema use were noted but large variations in use during run-in made the data difficult to interpret.

<P>One crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Korsten-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Korsten 2005</LINK>) studied SCI patients and compared neostigmine-glycopyrrolate with placebo (saline); however, the data were not suitable for analysis in RevMan. The trial report stated that prompt bowel evacuation was reported for the drug infusion compared with placebo; the volume of simulated stool expelled on a proctogram was rated as greater with the drug combination than with saline and was reported as a statistically significant difference.

<P>The trialists reported that bowel care took less time when it was initiated with a PGB suppository as compared to a HVB suppository (43 versus 74.5 minutes; P &lt; 0.01).

Results favoured this method over the first nine weeks of the rehabilitation phase but the data did not reach statistical significance (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). There were fewer accidental bowel evacuations and a smaller number of participants who reported accidents after mechanical evacuation during five out of the six weeks of treatment but this did not achieve statistical significance at nine weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). The number of participants with unsuccessful evacuations was smallest in the tap water enema protocol group; there was no difference between the two laxative groups.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 15:04:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an indication from small single trials that some interventions may produce positive outcomes in certain study participants. However, due to the small number of trials and the poor methodological quality of most of the identified evidence, it is not possible to draw any reliable conclusions or to predict whether future large, well-designed trials will confirm current findings.</P>
<P>The current evidence from small trials suggests that participants have a statistically significant increase (improvement) in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines when bulk-forming laxatives (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 1997</LINK>) or isosmotic macrogol solution (<LINK REF="STD-Zangaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zangaglia 2007</LINK>) are used as the intervention compared with no treatment or placebo.</P>
<P>There is evidence from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2006</LINK>) that transanal irrigation improves constipation score, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury, and patients were also more satisfied with this method. Another older trial supported the advantages of tap water enemas over laxatives (<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1973</LINK>) but the data were not suitable for analysis in RevMan.</P>
<P>Three trials showed statistically significant improvement (reduction) in total bowel care time with polyethylene glycol-based bisacodyl suppositories (<LINK REF="STD-House-1997" TYPE="STUDY">House 1997</LINK>), neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (<LINK REF="STD-Rosman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosman 2008</LINK>) and electrical stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Korsten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Korsten 2004</LINK>) when compared with placebo or no treatment. There was some evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Mun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mun 2011 </LINK>suggesting that carbonated water improved constipation scores. Finally, there was some evidence from three small trials to support the use of abdominal massage (<LINK REF="STD-McClurg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClurg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jeon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emly-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Emly 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timing evacuation to fit in with premorbid bowel habits is considered to contribute to the efficacy of a bowel management routine, though with little supporting evidence. The study by Venn and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Venn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 1992</LINK>) offers some evidence, although their adoption of an unvalidated "efficiency rating" makes the results of the study difficult to interpret. This remains the only study to address this issue. They explain their finding that a morning routine was more successful than an evening one by reference to stimulation of reflexes related to eating breakfast (gastrocolic reflex), although some trials have suggested that this may be diminished or absent in some neurogenic bowel conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-16 15:04:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified only small trials of almost uniformly poor methodological quality; the evidence base for this area of care is very scanty. Although this review now includes 20 trials, the bowel management interventions, populations, comparators and outcome measures were so varied that it was impossible to pool data and hence to draw strong conclusions.</P>
<P>In most of the trials, the authors did not report what "usual care" comprised, which made it difficult to classify and therefore generalise the data. There was little information on the acceptability of the interventions to participants and seldom on the impact on their quality of life, which might arguably be the most important factor for this group of patients.</P>
<P>For example, the value of using drugs that reduce transit time and may therefore produce a softer stool needs careful consideration in the bowel management of the neurologically disabled; a softer stool is more difficult to control and is often associated with increased faecal incontinence. An increase in the frequency of bowel evacuation may be equally unwelcome in this population due to the increased use of time and other resources, including carers' time, which it implies.</P>
<P>There is a need for trials to use outcome measures that reflect the wider implications of neurogenic disability and are specific to this patient group. In the trial conducted by Cornell (<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1973</LINK>) a mechanical method (tap water enema) was the most effective management method in rehabilitating spinal cord injured individuals; but as the authors pointed out, this approach to bowel care was not acceptable to injured individuals and their families for use at home. This underlines the importance of collaborative development of bowel management programmes which are acceptable to the people who are going to use them and those who may be involved in their implementation. It also highlights the different requirements of care in the hospital and home setting, which should be borne in mind when researching management methods.</P>
<P>Nurses are the healthcare professionals who deal most intimately with the problems of bowel management. They are involved in hands-on care and in supporting, educating and advising patients and their families and carers in the long term. Nurse-led care has been found to be effective in the treatment of non-neurogenic faecal incontinence in a hospital outpatient setting (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2001</LINK>). While the impact of the intervention in the study by Harari and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Harari-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harari 2004</LINK>) was relatively short lived, it suggests that even a one-off intervention involving face-to-face nurse contact can be effective in improving outcomes in patients with bowel dysfunction. The role of the nurse in assessment, information giving and empowerment of individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction merits further investigation.</P>
<P>Rectal stimulation is an important part of the bowel management process for many individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction, providing a trigger for bowel evacuation at a chosen time. This can be achieved by mechanical or pharmaceutical means. Despite the frequent clinical use of suppositories and enemas for this purpose, research evidence for the efficacy of the various products and approaches is seriously lacking. The small study reported by House and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-House-1997" TYPE="STUDY">House 1997</LINK>) needs to be repeated, with a larger sample and a range of other products.</P>
<P>Good evidence for the benefits of transanal irrigation in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury and problematic bowel management was provided in a well-designed and appropriately powered randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2006</LINK>). Further work is needed to explore the benefits in newly injured individuals.</P>

<P>The evidence base for management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction across all aetiologies is extremely poor. In most of the trials the characteristics of participants and the choice of outcome measures were too dissimilar for a quantitative synthesis of results to be appropriate. Confidence intervals were wide because of the small sample sizes.</P>
<P>Most interventions were only addressed in single small studies. However, the risk of bias was judged to be low in two of the trials which favoured an active intervention (transanal irrigation: <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2006</LINK>; and abdominal massage: <LINK REF="STD-McClurg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">McClurg 2011</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:45:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral laxatives are commonly used by individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction despite the lack of evidence to support their prescription. In the able-bodied, prucalopride has been reported to reduce colonic transit time, improve stool consistency and increase frequency of bowel evacuation in chronically constipated and older people (<LINK REF="REF-Coremans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coremans 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emmanuel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmanuel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloots-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloots 2002</LINK>). However, the use of prucalopride in people with spinal cord injuries, reported by Krogh and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Krogh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krogh 2002</LINK>), did not show any statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant parameters such as duration of bowel care, reduction in episodes of faecal incontinence or the need for digital evacuation of stool. The rate of side effects from the drug was high even if the events were not serious.</P>
<P>While Huang and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>) do not propose a mode of action for their herbal remedy, it seems likely that increased motility may at least in part account for its efficacy. The use of another herbal remedy is reported by Suehiro and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Suehiro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suehiro 2005</LINK>). They found that Dai-ken-chu-to and Keish-bukuryo-gan given to patients from the first day post-colorectal resection improved bowel motility and reduced length of hospital stay. Publications in western journals of studies of Chinese or herbal medicine are very infrequent, and obtaining translations of papers written in Chinese is difficult. However, the report by Huang and Li (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>) suggests that there may be much to learn from this traditional approach to health care.</P>
<P>Modulation of stool consistency is the purpose of bulk-forming laxatives such as ispaghula husk, psyllium, methylcellulose and sterculia. Ispaghula husk has been reported to improve evacuation parameters in a sample of healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK>). Its efficacy has also been reported in a study of people with simple constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Dettmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dettmar 1998</LINK>). Psyllium has been reported to be effective in the management of simple (<LINK REF="REF-McRorie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McRorie 1998</LINK>) and chronic (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 1997</LINK>) constipation and in constipation among older people (<LINK REF="REF-Cheskin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheskin 1995</LINK>). However, some studies have suggested that the neurogenic bowel does not respond in the same way to fibre supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menardo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menardo 1987</LINK>). The very small study of psyllium by Ashraf and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 1997</LINK>) remains the only reported work conducted in a neurologically impaired population and the role of fibre supplementation in neurogenic bowel management is yet to be determined.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-09 15:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the evidence reviewed here is generally of poor quality, and few studies were identified, there was some limited evidence from individual trials in favour of bulk-forming laxatives (psyllium), isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase and anticholinergic drug combination compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-16 15:05:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for rigorous randomised trials using clinically relevant outcome measures specific to this patient group, and particularly taking account of personal dignity, acceptability and effect on quality of life. The variety of studies included in the review underscores the complexity of neurogenic bowel management. In this area, where effective management rather than cure is the aim, the significance of the nursing contribution in establishing and maintaining effective care needs further evaluation. Despite the addition of 15 new trials since the last publication of this review, trials are mostly small and evidence for neurogenic bowel management remains poor.</P>
<P>Further trials are required in all aspects of this care including the role of fibre and diet, the use and long term implications of laxatives, the use of digital rectal stimulation and manual evacuation, and the relative benefits of rectal stimulants (suppositories and enemas) and facilitative techniques such as abdominal massage and positioning. Studies to determine selection criteria for transanal irrigation, use in patients with subacute spinal cord injury, and the reason for decline in usage over time are also needed.</P>
<P>In the absence of reliable information about what is important to patients regarding the outcomes of bowel management, very limited validated outcome measures, and with little evidence to support any intervention, it is not possible to prioritise where experimental research activity should be focused.</P>
<P>The development of condition-specific outcome measures, particularly for quality of life, will benefit the objective evaluation of interventions in the future. The development and adoption of agreed definitions of faecal incontinence and constipation in individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction would also greatly improve comparability of studies and facilitate meta-analysis of the findings of smaller trials.</P>
<P>The duration and type of the underlying neurological condition may also be significant in the response of people to interventions, whether due to continuing physical changes related to the condition (improvement or deterioration) or due to prior bowel management interventions that is stimulant laxatives. Harari and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Harari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harari 2003</LINK>) reported that one third of stroke patients who had faecal incontinence at three months were continent at one year. It may be appropriate to select participants according to the duration of their neurological condition. A fuller description of participants and interventions is needed.</P>
<P>No randomised controlled studies have been conducted of surgical interventions for neurogenic bowel management, although a study based on a registry of sacral nerve stimulation in incomplete spinal cord injured patients found they benefited from the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Jarrett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarrett 2005</LINK>). Further studies on both sacral anterior root and sacral nerve stimulation are required. Research into the low uptake of functional electrical stimulation implants for continence, to date, might be of value in shaping future developments.</P>
<P>The content and methods of delivery of assessment and teaching also require formal evaluation, as do the optimal frequency and content of routine assessments required to maintain efficacy and avoid complications.</P>
<P>The development of an effective bowel management programme requires a number of inputs which include oral and rectal laxatives (stimulants, osmotics, softeners and bulkers), physical interventions such as anorectal stimulation, digital evacuation, enema or transanal irrigation, abdominal massage, and the adoption of a routine (of intervention and timing). These interventions function against a backdrop of other variables such as diet and fluid intake, level of activity, posture adopted for bowel evacuation, premorbid bowel habit, concomitant medications, psychological factors and the pathology of the specific neurogenic condition. The reduced mobility and other physical disabilities imposed by the underlying condition must also be considered. All of these factors interact and are variable between individuals; however, a clearer understanding of the contribution of each factor to the bowel management process will improve the ability to establish effective bowel care with a smaller degree of "trial and error" than is currently the case.</P>
<P>The development of bowel management protocols continues to be empirical, and achievement of an effective programme will involve trial and error. It is widely accepted that the development of interventions and bowel management programmes should be based on a comprehensive, individualised, patient-centred assessment and use interventions of proven effectiveness. Such an assessment should include the physical abilities of the individual, availability of care, and the social setting as well as clinical issues. The chosen lifestyle and preferences of the individual should be central to planned care. The education of patients and their carers should go hand in hand with the planning of the bowel programme. The bowel programme should be reviewed regularly.</P>

<P>Five studies related to the use of the prokinetic medications included in previous reviews have been removed. Cisapride has been withdrawn from sale worldwide since the conduct of these studies. Since the drug was licensed in 1988 there have been 386 reports of serious ventricular arrhythmias (125 fatal) associated with its use and 50 reports of sudden unexplained death (<LINK REF="REF-Ferriman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferriman 2002</LINK>). Tegaserod was also withdrawn in 2007 due to concerns regarding adverse cardiovascular effects.</P>
