<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-05 09:47:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute pain is pain of recent onset and limited duration. Acute pain is associated with surgery, physical trauma (e.g. broken bones, burns and cuts) and medical procedures (e.g. venepuncture and sigmoidoscopy). Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a treatment to relieve pain by administering mild electrical currents to the body using electrode pads attached to the surface of the skin.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does TENS relieve acute pain in adults?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 19 clinical trials published up to 3 December 2014, which examined 1346 people. The trials administered TENS to produce a strong non painful 'tingling' sensation at the site of acute pain. The trials assessed TENS for cervical laser treatment, venepuncture, sigmoidoscopy, rib fractures and uterine contractions after childbirth. We did not include trials that assessed TENS for pain associated with childbirth, dental procedures and menstruation because they have been the subject of other Cochrane Reviews. Eleven trials are awaiting classification.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>TENS was better than placebo TENS (delivering no electrical current) at reducing the intensity of acute pain but the reduction in pain was not consistent across all trials. This finding was based on an analysis of only six of the 19 trials. There was an insufficient number patients to make a firm conclusion.</P>
<P>A small number of patients experienced itching and redness beneath the TENS pads or disliked the sensation produced by TENS.</P>
<P>Overall we concluded that TENS may reduce the intensity of acute pain in some patients but the quality of evidence was weak. TENS is inexpensive, safe and can be self-administered. We recommended that TENS should be considered as a treatment option given on its own or in combination with other treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was moderate to low because sample sizes were small and some patients were aware that they were receiving TENS or placebo.</P>

<P>This is a second update of a Cochrane Review originally published in Issue 2, 2009.

<P>To assess the analgesic effectiveness of TENS, as a sole treatment, for acute pain in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases up to 3 December 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; and AMED. We also checked the reference lists of included trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with acute pain (&lt; 12 weeks) if they examined TENS given as a sole treatment and assessed pain with subjective pain scales. Trials were eligible if they compared TENS to placebo TENS, no treatment controls, pharmacological interventions or non-pharmacological interventions. We excluded trials on experimental pain, case reports, clinical observations, letters, abstracts or reviews. Also we excluded trials investigating the effect of TENS on pain during childbirth (labour), primary dysmenorrhoea or dental procedures. Studies where TENS was given with another treatment as part of the formal trial design were excluded. We did not restrict any articles based on language of publication.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-29 10:49:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and carried out study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment and analyses of data. We extracted data on the following: types of participants and pain condition, trial design and methods, treatment parameters, adverse effects, and outcome measures. We contacted trial authors for additional information if necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials in the original review (2009) and included no further trials in the first update (2011). An additional seven new trials met the inclusion criteria in this second update. In total, we included 19 RCTs involving 1346 participants at entry, with 11 trials awaiting classification either because the full text was unavailable or information in the full text failed to clarify eligibility. We excluded most trials because TENS was given in combination with another treatment as part of the formal study design or TENS was not delivered using appropriate TENS technique. The types of acute pain included in this Cochrane Review were procedural pain, e.g. cervical laser treatment, venepuncture, screening flexible sigmoidoscopy and non-procedural pain, e.g. postpartum uterine contractions and rib fractures. We pooled data for pain intensity for six trials (seven comparisons) comparing TENS with placebo but the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic suggested substantial heterogeneity. Mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 100 mm) was -24.62 mm (95% CI -31.79 to -17.46) in favour of TENS. Data for the proportion of participants achieving &#8805; 50% reduction in pain was pooled for four trials (seven comparisons) and relative risk was 3.91 (95% CI 2.42 to 6.32) in favour of TENS over placebo. We pooled data for pain intensity from five trials (seven comparisons) but the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic suggested considerable heterogeneity. MD was -19.05 mm (95% CI -27.30 to -10.79) in favour of TENS using a random-effects model. It was not possible to pool other data. There was a high risk of bias associated with inadequate sample sizes in treatment arms and unsuccessful blinding of treatment interventions. Seven trials reported minor adverse effects, such as mild erythema and itching underneath the electrodes and participants disliking TENS sensation.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-30 14:53:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review update includes seven new trials, in addition to the 12 trials reviewed in the first update in 2011. The analysis provides tentative evidence that TENS reduces pain intensity over and above that seen with placebo (no current) TENS when administered as a stand-alone treatment for acute pain in adults. The high risk of bias associated with inadequate sample sizes in treatment arms and unsuccessful blinding of treatment interventions makes definitive conclusions impossible. There was incomplete reporting of treatment in many reports making replication of trials impossible.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review is a second update of <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2009</LINK>, and replaces the 2011 update.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-24 00:44:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage" (<LINK REF="REF-Merskey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merskey 1994</LINK>). Acute pain is defined as pain "of recent onset and probable limited duration which usually has an identifiable temporal and causal relationship to the injury or disease". In clinical practice acute pain is categorised as pain of less than three months duration (<LINK REF="REF-Strong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strong 2002</LINK>). Current approaches to acute pain management include pharmacological agents (drugs) and a number of non-pharmacological agents, one of which is Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) (<LINK REF="REF-Schug-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schug 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>TENS is the delivery of pulsed electrical currents across the intact surface of the skin to stimulate peripheral nerves principally for pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2014</LINK>). In clinical practice TENS is administered using a portable, battery-powered device that generates electrical currents that are delivered to the body via electrodes attached to the intact surface of the skin. TENS is inexpensive and can be self-administered. The safety profile of TENS compares positively compared with medication. Safety guidelines published by professional bodies guide judgements about whether it is appropriate to use TENS (<LINK REF="REF-Houghton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houghton 2010</LINK>). Contradictions include TENS for patients who also have electronic implants, such as cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Precautions include pregnancy, epilepsy, active malignancy, deep-vein thrombosis, and frail or damaged skin.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Natural forms of electricity (e.g. electrogenic fish) have been used as a method of pain relief since the Egyptian era (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2014</LINK>). A theoretical foundation for electroanalgesia (pain relief by electrical methods) was established in 1965 through the publication of Melzack and Wall's gate control theory of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1965</LINK>). This theory proposed that a metaphorical gate consisting of excitatory and inhibitory synapses existed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The gate could regulate the amount of nociceptive traffic (painful stimuli) being transmitted onwards to the brain. This gate could be opened by noxious stimuli that excited high threshold small diameter peripheral afferents and could be closed by non-noxious stimuli (e.g. touch, pressure and electrical currents) that excited low threshold large diameter peripheral afferents.</P>
<P>Technological advances have produced a variety of TENS devices with a wide range of stimulation parameters for clinicians and patients to choose from (e.g. pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, pulse duration and electrode placement site). TENS interventions tend to be described according to technical characteristics as either high frequency, low intensity (conventional TENS) or low frequency, high intensity (acupuncture-like TENS, AL-TENS). This technical approach fails to specify the physiological intention of delivering TENS. In this regard, the physiological intention when administering conventional TENS is to activate selectively non-noxious low threshold afferent nerve fibres in the skin (A&#946;-fibres) which are claimed to inhibit transmission of nociceptive information at the level of the spinal cord (i.e. segmental modulation) (<LINK REF="REF-DeSantana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSantana 2008</LINK>). In practice, A&#946; nerve fibre activity is recognised by the user reporting strong electrical paraesthesia (pins and needles) beneath the electrodes. The physiological intention of AL-TENS is to generate a muscle twitch which is believed to increase activity in small diameter afferent nerve fibres in muscles (A&#948;) leading to activation of descending pain inhibitory pathways. In practice, AL-TENS is achieved by administering low frequency and high intensity, but non-painful, currents over muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2011</LINK>). Interestingly, experimental evidence to establish the roles of different afferent fibres in TENS outcome is inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Garrison-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrison 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 2005</LINK>). Research suggests that different frequencies of TENS may act through different neurotransmitter systems. Sluka and colleagues conducted a series of animal studies that have shown that low frequency TENS-induced antihyperalgesia (decreased sensitivity to pain) is mediated by activation of serotonin and mu opioid receptors, while high frequency TENS activates delta opioid receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Kalra-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalra 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sluka-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sluka 1999</LINK>). In 2008, a systematic review evaluating frequency dependent effects on experimentally induced pain in humans was inconclusive due to an insufficient number of high quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK>). In recent years frequency-dependent effects have been confirmed in human subjects by high quality research studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Claydon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claydon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leonard-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00e9_onard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Léonard 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liebano-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebano 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>TENS is used extensively by people with acute and chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-DeSantana-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSantana 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2011</LINK>). Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of TENS for chronic musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2007</LINK>) and for osteoarthritis of the knee (<LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2007</LINK>) demonstrated a significant effect on pain over placebo. Cochrane Reviews on TENS for specific chronic pain conditions have been hindered by methodological weaknesses in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sluka-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sluka 2013</LINK>). An all-encompassing Cochrane Review on TENS for a variety of chronic pain conditions (i.e. pain &gt; three months' duration) reported inconclusive results (<LINK REF="REF-Nnoaham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nnoaham 2008</LINK>). However, this review has now been withdrawn and is being replaced by new reviews on TENS for neuropathic pain in adults, led by Gibson (protocol in press) and TENS for fibromyalgia, led by Claydon et al (protocol in press). There is also a title registered for an overview of Cochrane Reviews of TENS for chronic pain (protocol in press).</P>
<P>Cochrane Reviews on TENS for specific types of acute pain have been inconclusive for labour pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2009</LINK>) and dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2002</LINK>). An early systematic review of TENS for post-operative pain found TENS to be no better than controls for postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1996</LINK>) although pain measures were taken when patients were allowed free access to analgesic medication. This compromises pain scores because patients in placebo and TENS groups titrate analgesic medication to achieve effective pain relief, and therefore exhibit similar pain scores. Review authors also included trials that underdosed TENS or used an inappropriate TENS technique, or both. A meta-analysis with subgroup analysis demonstrated a significantly better outcome for TENS when applied using adequate (optimal) stimulation techniques when compared to non-adequate stimulation techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK>); optimal TENS techniques were defined as an intensity that was strong enough to generate a strong paraesthesia and electrodes applied at the site of the operative scar. Recent evidence from systematic reviews suggests that TENS is superior to placebo TENS when used in combination with analgesic medication for thoracotomy and post-sternotomy pain (<LINK REF="REF-Freynet-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freynet 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sbruzzi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sbruzzi 2012</LINK>). To date, there has been no all-encompassing systematic review on TENS for acute pain. A systematic review, which takes account of adequate TENS techniques, is necessary to assist clinicians and researchers to make informed decisions on the effectiveness of this modality for acute pain. TENS can be given either as a sole treatment, i.e. stand alone treatment, or combined with other interventions. This Cochrane Review will focus on TENS given as a sole treatment only to see if it has sufficient efficacy in its own right.</P>

<P>Study participants were required to be adults (i.e. 16 years and over) with a diagnosis of acute pain (less than 12 weeks) by any cause including injury or surgical intervention. Acute pain conditions included, but were not limited to, the following: angina; back pain; fractures; headache; musculoskeletal pain and procedural pain. We included postpartum pain trials if the pain investigated was due to episiotomy or Caesarean section irrespective of the presence of uterine cramps. We excluded trials including patients with pain due to uterine contractions (i.e. labour) alone and trials including patients with acute pain due to primary dysmenorrhoea as these conditions have been covered by previous Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2002</LINK>).

<P>We only included trials which evaluated surface electrical nerve stimulation for the treatment of acute pain (i.e. transcutaneous as opposed to percutaneous electrical stimulation). We defined appropriate delivery of TENS as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>A 'standard TENS device' was used which delivered biphasic or monophasic (type of waveform) pulsed electrical currents in the mA range. TENS had to be delivered using at least two surface electrodes. We excluded TENS delivered using single probes (i.e. TENS pens). Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) devices and Interferential Current devices were excluded;</LI>
<LI>TENS was administered to produce a strong electrical paraesthesia that was felt by the patient. We included AL-TENS delivered at strong intensities to generate muscle twitches. We excluded trials if the active TENS intervention was delivered at intensities reported to be 'barely perceptible', 'faint' or 'mild';</LI>
<LI>TENS was administered on an area of the body which was sensate (where pain is being felt) at either (a) the site of pain or (b) over nerve bundles proximal (or near) to the site of pain. We only included TENS delivered at acupuncture stimulation points if the point was lying over nerve bundles proximal (or near) to the site of pain. We considered any parameters of treatment meeting these criteria as were any duration or frequency of treatment and either self-applied or therapist-applied treatments.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>TENS versus placebo TENS (i.e. use of a sham TENS device).

A variety of subjective descriptors were used to describe the intensity of TENS including: tingling, non-painful sensation from stimulated area (high frequency TENS group) or non-painful muscular contractions in stimulated area (low frequency TENS group (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1983</LINK>); strong but tolerable tingling (<LINK REF="STD-Amer_x002d_Cuenca-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amer-Cuenca 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>); subjective level of comfort (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1985</LINK>); highest level that did not make participants uncomfortable (<LINK REF="STD-Oncel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oncel 2002</LINK>); definite but comfortable perception with no muscle activation (<LINK REF="STD-Roche-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Roche 1985</LINK>); and below pain threshold (<LINK REF="STD-Coyne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-De-Angelis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Angelis 2003</LINK> used the term 'tickle' to describe the level of intensity. This is an unusual term and may be a result of translation from non-English language.

One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Ekblom-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ekblom 1987</LINK>, had two TENS groups, one with a pulse frequency of 2 Hz and one with a frequency of 100 Hz.

Often it was difficult to ascertain exactly how often and for how long TENS was administered in trials using multiple TENS treatment sessions. Three of the seven reports of trials on procedural pain did not specify treatment duration (<LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Angelis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Angelis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hruby-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hruby 2006</LINK>); in those that did, treatment duration varied from five minutes to four hours (<LINK REF="STD-Coyne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limoges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Limoges 2004</LINK>) or was described as being for the duration of the procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Amer_x002d_Cuenca-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amer-Cuenca 2011</LINK>).

In most trials placebo TENS was operationalised as a sham TENS device with no current output that was similar in appearance to the active TENS device but had no batteries, or the internal circuit disconnected, or the device was not switched on. <LINK REF="STD-Gregorini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gregorini 2010</LINK> administered placebo TENS using an active device with an inter-pulse interval of 33 seconds and claimed that this would avoid an analgesic effect. <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1985</LINK> applied a low pulse amplitude stimulus (fixed at 2.5 mA) as they felt this was a more valid control than a no stimulus placebo; for the purposes of this review, this was treated as low pulse amplitude TENS rather than placebo TENS.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All trials used standard pain scales/questionnaires to record pain (VAS; NRS; McGill Pain Questionnaire, MPQ; VRS) but many trials did not provide sufficient information about the exact instruction given to participants about how to rate pain scores. Thus, it was difficult to determine whether pain scores were taken at a specific moment in time (e.g. present pain intensity) or retrospectively for over a specified period of time (e.g. pain intensity for the previous 24 hours) and if taken retrospectively whether scores were for 'average' pain or worst pain episode. Other outcomes included time in minutes until first report of pain reduction and maximum pain reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1983</LINK>), overall impression of using TENS (<LINK REF="STD-de-Sousa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">de Sousa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1985</LINK>), discomfort during TENS (<LINK REF="STD-Amer_x002d_Cuenca-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amer-Cuenca 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Sousa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">de Sousa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ols_x00e9_n-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Olsén 2007</LINK>). One trial used a Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Keskin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Keskin 2012</LINK>).

<P>For this update we retrieved 1065 reports from the literature searches after we removed duplicates, of which we considered 1038 irrelevant or excluded against eligibility criteria based on screening of abstracts (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We obtained 24 full-text trial reports, of which we excluded 17. Overall we excluded 120 trials on the basis that TENS was given in combination with another treatment as part of the formal trial design, of which 73 were postoperative pain trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In most trials, TENS was given with analgesic medication as part of the formal trial design but some provided TENS in conjunction with non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. TENS given as part of a physiotherapy package of treatment. The reasons for excluding the remaining trials included not using a standard TENS device or TENS intensity in the active intervention was too low (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>The primary objective of this Cochrane Review was to assess the analgesic effectiveness of TENS, as a sole treatment, for acute pain in adults. We were unable to extract data from included trials for the following reasons: data presented as median and interquartile (IQ) range (<LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keskin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Keskin 2012</LINK>); insufficient data provided (<LINK REF="STD-Coyne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 1995</LINK>).

We also decided to extract data from the two trials that included at least one participant under 16 years (age range: <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK> = 15 to 58 years; <LINK REF="STD-Oncel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oncel 2002</LINK> = 11 to 81 years) because the mean ages for the sample populations were above 30 years. We contacted the following authors in an attempt to obtain the data: <LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1992</LINK> (responded but unable to provide data as mean and SD); <LINK REF="STD-Coyne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 1995</LINK> (responded but unable to provide data); <LINK REF="STD-Hruby-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hruby 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-De-Angelis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Angelis 2003</LINK> (no response). There were insufficient extractable data to allow us to pool data for meta-analysis for most planned comparisons. We decided to pool data for pain intensity (100 mm VAS) and proportion of participants achieving &#8805; 50% reduction in pain, although there was variability in procedures used to measure pain scores including whether scores were for present or retrospective pain and whether TENS was switched on during pain ratings.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated Cochrane Review examined the effectiveness of TENS as a sole intervention for the treatment of acute pain in adults. We retrieved 1065 reports from literature searches for this update, in addition to the 1775 reports identified for the 2011 update. We included seven new trials and 11 studies are awaiting classification. Thus, 19 RCTs involving 1346 participants at entry met the inclusion criteria. We were able to extract data from 13 of the 19 included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amer_x002d_Cuenca-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Amer-Cuenca 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheing-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cheing 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Angelis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Angelis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Sousa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">de Sousa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekblom-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ekblom 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limoges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Limoges 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ols_x00e9_n-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Olsén 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oncel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oncel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ordog-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ordog 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roche-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Roche 1985</LINK>). Eight of 11 trial reports with a placebo TENS comparison identified a statistically significant improvement in favour of TENS of at least one outcome measures at one or more measurement time point. Pooled data from six trials found a MD of -24.62 mm (95% CI -31.79 to -17.46) on 100mm VAS in favour of TENS. Pooled data from four trials (seven comparisons) found a relative risk of 3.91 (95% CI 2.42 to 6.32), in favour of TENS with a NNTB of 2.49 for the proportion of participants achieving &#8805; 50% reduction in pain. The NNTB is remarkably low and most likely to have been exaggerated by the high risk of bias associated with small sample sizes and various other biases as highlighted in the risk of bias analysis. We do not attribute statistical credibility to the effect sizes because of statistical heterogeneity but it is noteworthy that the direction of effect is consistent.</P>
<P>Five of the seven trial reports with a no treatment control identified an improvement in favour of TENS in at least one outcome measure at one or more time point. Pooled data from five studies produced a MD of -19.05mm (95% CI -27.30 to -10.79) in favour of TENS. Three out of four trials that compared TENS with an analgesic drug and one out of two studies that compared TENS with a non-pharmacological treatment found an improvement in favour of TENS of at least one outcome measure at one or more measurement time point. Three trials included a comparison between high and low pulse amplitude and all found that higher pulse amplitudes were superior. This finding is consistent with recent experimental pain studies that indicated high pulse amplitude (irrespective of the applied frequency) is the key parameter for effective TENS applications (<LINK REF="REF-Aarskog-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarskog 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Claydon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claydon 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of TENS for postoperative pain by <LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK> highlighted the relevance of optimal (strong or maximal non-painful) intensity levels for pain relief in this clinical population. There were no differences in the proportion of participants achieving &#8805; 50% reduction in pain between conventional and AL-TENS in the two included trials. Three trial reports indicated that there were no adverse effects and seven reports indicated a range of adverse effects that were primarily related to sensations experienced at the electrode site or the muscle contractions associated with low frequency TENS. We judged these as minor. The methodological quality of the trials varied considerably: we judged sequence generation to be adequate in ten trials, allocation concealment was adequate in three trials and only five had adequate assessor blinding. There was a high risk of bias associated with inadequate sample sizes with only two trials having sample sizes &#8805; 50 per treatment arm.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The range of acute pain conditions included in this review was limited by eligibility criteria that excluded trials of acute pain during childbirth and primary dysmenorrhoea because these conditions have been covered by previous Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2002</LINK>). In addition, we excluded trials that evaluated TENS in combination with any other treatment as part of the formal trial design (e.g. analgesic medication, exercise) on the basis that addition of another treatment would compromise pain relief measures making it impossible to ascertain the contribution of TENS. The highest number of excluded trials were on postoperative pain as they gave analgesic medication in addition to TENS for pain management. The effect of TENS in combination with other treatments for acute pain is the subject for another systematic review. We categorised the 19 included trials into procedural and non-procedural pain but were unable to pool data for subgroup analyses. All trials were in the English language with most based in Europe. Only one trial described the use of TENS by the participants solely at home (<LINK REF="STD-Ordog-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ordog 1987</LINK>). As TENS can easily be self-applied for most conditions, this limits the evidence for comparison of self-applied versus therapist-applied TENS. The range of outcome measures used provided limited data that could be extracted from the included trials.</P>
<P>The reporting of TENS treatments showed wide variations across the included trials. Several trials failed to report full details of the TENS parameters used or technique of application, thus making replication impossible. Attempts to combine outcomes in a meta-analysis were undermined by substantial heterogeneity, a lack of available data, and a lack of specific information on procedures used to measure pain scores, especially whether scores were taken for present pain or retrospective pain, during or after TENS. This seriously limits the interpretation of the results. Both experimental pain and clinical studies suggest that maximum pain relief is obtained while TENS is switched on (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2007</LINK>). Thus the timing of pain measurement is crucial, particularly for procedural pain; some included trials measured pain post procedure but asked participants to record 'during procedure' pain thus relying on recall (<LINK REF="STD-De-Angelis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Angelis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limoges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Limoges 2004</LINK>). Often it was impossible to ascertain the exact instruction given to participants about the nature of the pain score required. As TENS has been shown to have maximum pain relieving effects during application, it is important to record pain outcome whilst it is being applied. Few trials continued to record the effect of TENS on pain outcome for more than a few days thus limiting any conclusions regarding the duration of effect of TENS on acute pain.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 19 included trials involved 1346 participants at entry. In general, the quality of the evidence was weak due to inadequate methods or lack of information on: allocation concealment; blinding of the outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and method of analysis (per protocol or ITT). There was a high risk of bias from inadequate sample sizes. Sample sizes ranged from eight to 71 per group and nine trials had fewer than 20 participants in each treatment arm. Only three trials had a prospective sample size calculation. Blinding participants to active TENS is challenging because treatment necessitates a perceptual experience (i.e. TENS sensation) yet investigators should make every attempt to introduce uncertainty about which treatment arm is active through carefully worded pre-trial instructions. TENS naïvety is an important inclusion criteria in trials attempting to blind participants. Only four of the trials that compared TENS to placebo used participants that were TENS naïve. Typically placebo TENS was administered using a sham TENS device with no electrical output and no perceptual experience and this can be a credible approach to achieve at least partial blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1990</LINK>). However, there was no attempt in included trials to monitor the success or otherwise of blinding using an assessment tool, such as that developed by <LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1990</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Rakel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rakel 2010</LINK> developed and tested a new sham TENS device that delivered a current for 30 seconds, which then declined in amplitude to 0 mA over 15 seconds. This output allowed the clinician to set the pulse amplitude without knowing if the unit was an active or sham device. Thus, the method of delivery of treatment by the clinician was identical for each participant and this type of sham TENS device may be useful for future trials. <LINK REF="REF-Hrobjartsson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrobjartsson 2007</LINK> highlighted this issue of monitoring blinding in RCTs and analysed a random sample of 1599 blinded RCTs indexed in CENTRAL and found that only 2% of trials included tests for the success of blinding.</P>

<P>In this update we identified seven additional trials to the 12 trials reviewed in 2011. The analysis of 19 RCTs with 1346 participants provides tentative evidence that TENS reduces pain intensity over and above that seen with placebo (no current) TENS when administered as a stand-alone treatment for acute pain in adults. However, the high risk of bias associated with inadequate sample sizes in treatment arms and unsuccessful blinding of treatment interventions makes definitive conclusions impossible. The additional analyses conducted in this second update strengthen evidence presented in <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2009</LINK>. Whether TENS should be considered as a potential treatment option for patients and clinicians managing acute pain remains a matter for debate, although TENS compares favourably to many alternatives because it can be self-administered, safe, inexpensive and readily available to patients over the counter.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-01 10:18:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was incomplete reporting of treatment in many reports, making replication of trials impossible. Further adequately powered research trials are required to provide a comprehensive assessment of the role of TENS as a sole treatment in acute pain management. <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2011</LINK> has provided criteria and operational guidelines for the design of a robust RCT on TENS. PaPaS guidance suggests that a sample size of &#8805; 200 participants per treatment arm is necessary for a low risk of bias in RCTs. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement has been revised for non-pharmacological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>); this should be adopted to ensure better reporting of all aspects of trial design and subsequent reporting. In particular, appropriate sequence generation and allocation concealment methods should be used and reported. Sample size calculations should be performed to determine appropriate participant numbers. Complete details of the TENS application should be provided to allow subgroup analysis between trials. Appropriate TENS technique should be used including a strong non-painful TENS sensation at the site of pain. A clear description of missing data and how they are analysed is required. Outcome assessor blinding should be adopted as a key element of future trial design. Blinding of participants is accepted as a challenge in TENS trials but should be addressed nevertheless. Finally, future trials should adopt a common policy of reporting means and SDs for continuous data to enable data extraction for subsequent meta-analysis. </P>

<U>Pain outcome:</U> numerical rating scale (NRS) 11 point (0 to 10) carried out at the beginning of the trial (1st evaluation), at 60 mins (2nd evaluation) and 120 mins (3rd evaluation). Pain was measured during resting, sitting and ambulation at each evaluation. McGill pain questionnaire used to obtain pain descriptors.</P>
<P>
<U>ITT/per protocol analysis:</U> not stated.</P>
<P>
<U>Statistical analysis:</U> data for the groups were compared using the unpaired t-test and intragroup differences analysed using a repeated-measures ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test. Mann-Whitney test was used for analysing continuous variables such as neonatal or obstetric data and Pearson's Chi² test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. Groups presented similar pain scores at baseline. The application of TENS significantly reduced pain intensity in resting, sitting and ambulating (P &gt; 0.001) immediately after TENS and 60 mins later compared with the control group. Comparing the 1st evaluation with the 3rd there was only a significant difference in the TENS group.</P>
<P>On the McGill pain questionnaire at baseline there were no significant differences. After TENS there was a decrease in NWC (P &gt; 0.001) in the TENS group and PRI for the sensory, affective, evaluative, miscellaneous and total categories (P &gt; 0.001). The TENS group also showed a reduction in the NWC. The control group did not show a similar alteration in the PRI or NWC.</P>

<P>It is impossible to adequately blind participants who receive electrical stimulation.</P>
<P>"These patients were told that they might or might not feel a sensation of tingling, and this instruction was carefully standardized. The same blinded nurses performed two phases of TENS therapy during the hospitalisation period and instructed the patients how to use the machine at home. These nurses were told that every patient would be treated with active TENS units and that they were not to know about the content of the trial. Inactive TENS units were out of battery and there were no signs on the machines that showed they were 'on'.'</P>
<P>Author response &#8216;As mentioned in the paper, the patients were completely unaware that the cases in the control group would not feel a sensation, and both the patients and the nurses assumed that all cases would have a TENS treatment."</P>
<P>The inclusion/exclusion criteria did not state that participants had to be TENS naïve.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>It is impossible to adequately blind participants who receive electrical stimulation.</P>
<P>"In the study, 50% of the patients received a functioning TENS-PAC, and the other 50% received a &#8216;placebo&#8217; unit, which appeared and operated in all ways similar to the functioning unit except that no electrical current was transmitted to the skin. This &#8216;placebo&#8217; unit was originally a functioning TENS-PAC, but in this unit, an internal wire that supplied the electrical current to the skin was cut. The TENS-PAC produces a slight hum and vibration that the &#8216;placebo&#8217; unit also produced. The &#8216;placebo&#8217; units were prepared by an independent source, and neither the researcher nor the patient was able to identify which unit was given until the trial was completed. The possibility that the patients might have figured out whether they had the placebo units seems remote, as patients were not told that the functioning units can produce a mild electrical shock by turning up the unit. As none of the patients had used TENS previously, it is unlikely that they would have known that an electrical shock could be produced only by the functioning units".</P>
