<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-28 12:01:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people have problems with attention after stroke. They are not able to concentrate for prolonged periods of time and are distractible, being unable to focus on a specific task in the presence of competing information. Cognitive rehabilitation involves providing therapeutic activities to reduce the severity of a cognitive impairment following damage to the brain. The benefit of cognitive rehabilitation for impairments of attention following stroke is unclear. Our aim was to review the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on attention, and in addition on functional abilities, mood and quality of life. We identified six randomised controlled trials that compared cognitive rehabilitation with a usual care control group for people with impairment of attention. The six studies involved 223 participants. We found a significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on divided attention at the end of the intervention period, but there was no evidence that these benefits persisted. In addition, there was no evidence to support or refute the effect of cognitive rehabilitation for other types of attention impairment or for any effect on functional abilities, mood or quality of life. The methodological quality of the trials identified and the paucity of studies means that we cannot draw conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation for attention. More research is needed. People with attentional impairments should continue to receive stroke rehabilitation services but more research is needed to identify the specific effects of specific cognitive rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Many survivors of stroke complain about attentional impairments, such as diminished concentration and mental slowness. However, the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for improving these impairments is uncertain.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:20:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether (1) people receiving attentional treatment show better outcomes in their attentional functions than those given no treatment or treatment as usual, and (2) people receiving attentional treatment techniques have a better functional recovery, in terms of independence in activities of daily living, mood and quality of life, than those given no treatment or treatment as usual.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:20:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> October 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to October 2012), EMBASE (1947 to October 2012), CINAHL (1981 to October 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to October 2012), PsycBITE and REHABDATA (searched October 2012) and ongoing trials registers. We screened reference lists and tracked citations using Scopus.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:20:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive rehabilitation for impairments of attention for people with stroke.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-30 15:59:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six RCTs with 223 participants. All six RCTs compared cognitive rehabilitation with a usual care control. Meta-analyses demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation for persisting effects on global measures of attention (two studies, 99 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.56; P value = 0.41), standardised attention assessments (two studies, 99 participants; P value &#8805; 0.08) or functional outcomes (two studies, 99 participants; P value &#8805; 0.15). In contrast, a statistically significant effect was found in favour of cognitive rehabilitation when compared with control for immediate effects on measures of divided attention (four studies, 165 participants; SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; P value &lt; 0.0001) but no significant effects on global attention (two studies, 53 participants; P value = 0.06), other attentional domains (six studies, 223 participants; P value &#8805; 0.16) or functional outcomes (three studies, 109 participants; P value &#8805; 0.21).</P>
<P>Thus there was limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may improve some aspects of attention in the short term, but there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the persisting effects of cognitive rehabilitation on attention, or on functional outcomes in either the short or long term.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:45:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation remains unconfirmed. The results suggest there may be a short-term effect on attentional abilities, but future studies need to assess the persisting effects and measure attentional skills in daily life. Trials also need to have higher methodological quality and better reporting.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-30 15:45:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Deficits in attention are one of the most commonly observed cognitive impairments after stroke. The exact frequency of attentional deficits after stroke is a matter of debate. Within the acute phase, estimates range between 46% and 92% (<LINK REF="STD-Stapleton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stapleton 2001</LINK>). At discharge from hospital estimates suggest a prevalence of between 24% and 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Hyndman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyndman 2008</LINK>). Speed of information processing can also be impaired and estimates have varied between 50% and 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Hochstenbach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochstenbach 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasquin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasquin 2004</LINK>). Attentional deficits may recover over time in some people (<LINK REF="REF-Hochstenbach-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochstenbach 2003</LINK>), but in 20% to 50% of stroke survivors there are persistent deficits for years (<LINK REF="REF-Barker_x002d_Collo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker-Collo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyndman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyndman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attentional impairments manifest themselves in a wide variety of deficits, such as diminished concentration, distractibility, reduced error control, difficulties doing more than one thing at a time, mental slowness and mental fatigability. Being a mediator of other processes, attentional deficits may also impair higher cognitive functions, such as language and memory (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 2004</LINK>). While there is a consensus that attention is not a unitary process, there is no agreement on the typologies and taxonomies describing the range of attentional processes. For the purpose of the current review we considered the following attentional components: alertness/arousal, selective attention, sustained attention (vigilance) and divided attention (see Table 1). The rehabilitation of deficits in spatial attention is covered in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>A distinction between different attention domains is potentially important when evaluating rehabilitation. There is some evidence that attentional components need to be trained separately as there is little generalisation of treatment from one attentional domain to another (<LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1997</LINK>). Moreover, it has been suggested that cognitive training for certain domains, such as divided and selective attention, may be more effective than training for other domains, such as alertness and sustained attention (<LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>).
<BR/>

</P>
<P>The treatment of cognitive deficits is necessary because they have a negative effect on functional abilities (<LINK REF="REF-Barker_x002d_Collo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker-Collo 2006</LINK>) and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kwa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nys-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nys 2006</LINK>). Sustained attention (concentration) is an important prerequisite for motor recovery, since sufficient sustained attention is a required for learning (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1997</LINK>). Deficits in attention can affect the ability to engage with physiotherapy and are associated with increased risk of falls (<LINK REF="REF-Hyndman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyndman 2003</LINK>). Other specific attentional disorders, such as auditory and visual selective attention, and divided attention, also affect functional recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Hyndman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyndman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stapleton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stapleton 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:45:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognitive rehabilitation has been defined as "a systematic functionally orientated intervention of therapeutic cognitive activities based on the assessment and understanding of the patient's brain behaviour deficits" (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2000</LINK>). Cognitive rehabilitation comprises the provision of therapeutic activities to reduce the severity of a cognitive deficit. This includes tasks designed to restore attention abilities, such as computerised activities and pencil-and-paper tasks requiring attention. The alternative approach is teaching people strategies to compensate for their attention impairments. Attempts to retrain attention skills have mainly relied on a restitution approach, although trials of attention retraining for people with traumatic brain injury have emphasised the development of compensatory strategies rather than the restoration of basic aspects of attention (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The European guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>) and a narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2011</LINK>) both concluded that during the acute phase there was insufficient evidence to support the effects of specific attention training for people with stroke. Although recommendations were made for attention training at a later stage, this was based mainly on evidence from people with traumatic brain injury rather than stroke.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:45:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognitive rehabilitation is based on two main principles. One is restitution, which aims to restore cognitive function through repeated practice. The other is compensation, which aims to reduce the effects of cognitive impairment on functional abilities using strategies that minimise demands on attention skills.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:45:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Impairments of attention are a major problem for people with stroke and affect rehabilitation outcome, but the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention is uncertain. In a survey of stroke survivor needs, 41% of respondents reported that they did not get the help they needed to address their concentration problems (<LINK REF="REF-McKevitt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKevitt 2010</LINK>). Although attention training has been provided for some people with stroke it needs further evaluation. There have been few studies that have used control groups and most evaluations have been based on single-case experimental designs. Although these indicate treatment can be effective, they do not evaluate the general applicability of the findings. This updated review aimed to consider the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention systematically.</P>

Groups were well matched at baseline apart from three studies. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 2009</LINK>), the time after stroke was shorter for controls than intervention group participants and in another, the control group had more people with aphasia and lower intelligence (<LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions aimed to either restore attentional functions (<LINK REF="STD-Barker_x002d_Collo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barker-Collo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohring 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westerberg 2007</LINK>), or provide compensatory strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Winkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 2009</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>) applied both intervention approaches. Interventions lasted from three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1991</LINK>) to 11 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Rohring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohring 2004</LINK>), and the number of sessions of treatment varied between 13 (<LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>) and 55 (<LINK REF="STD-Rohring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohring 2004</LINK>) for the restorative approaches. The compensatory approach was delivered for 10 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Winkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 2009</LINK>). The control groups in all studies received usual care with no treatment of attention deficits.</P>
<P>The six studies used over 30 psychometric tests with more than 40 test variables as attentional outcome measures.

Four studies comprising 165 participants assessed divided attention by the means of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) (<LINK REF="STD-Barker_x002d_Collo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Barker-Collo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Westerberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 2009</LINK>), or the divided attention subtest from the Tests of Attentional Performance battery (TAP) (<LINK REF="STD-Rohring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohring 2004</LINK>). The analysis found that the intervention was beneficial compared with care as usual (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; P value &lt; 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no significant effects on other domains of attention. An effect on alertness was investigated in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rohring-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rohring 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 2009</LINK>) comprising 136 participants (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.48; P value = 0.41; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Six studies comprising 223 participants examined the effects on selective attention (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18; P value = 0.53; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Four studies comprising 169 participants examined the effects on sustained attention. As the heterogeneity between trials for this measure was high (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%), we used a random-effects model for analysing sustained attention (SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.94; P value = 0.16; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The review in 2000 included two trials with 56 participants. In this update of the review, we included six trials with 223 participants.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:48:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was a significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on divided attention at the end of rehabilitation (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; P value &lt; 0.0001) but no significant effect at long-term follow-up. There was no evidence to support the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on global attentional function, other specific attentional domains (alertness, selective attention, sustained attention), functional abilities, mood or quality of life.</P>

We excluded some studies on the basis of information from authors (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>) and others confirmed the results were not yet available (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN45171788" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN45171788</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials generally had small sample sizes ranging from 18 to 78, which limits the ability to generalise from these studies. Future studies should be adequately powered to detect the effects of treatment on functional outcomes. The results from these studies should enable a power calculation for future studies.</P>
<P>The studies included a wide variety of interventions. Almost all were computerised. The comparison for most studies was treatment as usual. Future studies could be improved by the use of attention placebo control groups that provide the computerised activities but not including the attention retraining activities. This is feasible as it was used in an excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1992</LINK>), but not in any of those included.</P>
<P>Most studies assessed outcomes on measures of attention on standardised tests. The six studies reported 40 different test variables of attentional outcomes. It has been suggested that cognitive training for certain attentional domains might be more effective than for others (see <LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>) and that there is limited generalisation of treatment from one attentional domain to another (<LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1997</LINK>). It seemed therefore important to evaluate treatment effects on different attentional domains. However, it would be beneficial if there were broader consensus on the attentional processes these variables tap into and greater consistency in the choice of outcome measures. In addition, a composite test score assessing several attentional domains would assist with identifying the overall benefit of attention training. Few studies included functional outcomes, yet the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on functional outcomes is needed to inform clinical service developments.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for attentional deficits varied considerably across trials, and accordingly, the degree of attentional deficits at start of the treatment differed widely. Whether treatment success is modulated by the severity of attentional impairments in an individual person could not be addressed in this review.  </P>
<P>There were insufficient data to evaluate whether treatment is more effective in the postacute phase than in the acute phase of recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2011</LINK>). Similarly, the planned subgroup analyses to determine whether outcomes varied according to frequency of intervention (number of sessions per week), intensity of intervention (total hours of intervention) and type of intervention were not carried out as insufficient data were available.</P>

<P>The review was conducted by two authors who independently assessed the included studies and final decisions were made following discussion. The allocation of attention tasks to attentional domains was put forward by one author (TL) and confirmed by the second author (NL). While the assignments are consistent with commonly used typologies and taxonomies of attentional processes in clinical settings, it has to be acknowledged that these assignments are, to some degree, arbitrary as the same test variable may tap into several different attentional domains (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2006</LINK>). In addition, the exclusion of studies on attention retraining to improve driving ability and the delivery of music as cognitive stimulation was based on the criteria for the review process, but these studies could have been considered to be relevant to this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:48:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found some benefits of cognitive rehabilitation for divided attention, but not for other attentional domains. This finding is consistent with suggestions that treatment might be more beneficial for certain attentional domains (<LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sturm-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sturm 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review concludes that overall there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention after stroke. This conclusion is consistent with the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2000</LINK>) and another meta-analysis assessing treatment outcome of attention rehabilitation after acquired brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2001</LINK>). The appraisal of the evidence in favour of rehabilitation is somewhat less positive than two narrative reviews of cognitive rehabilitation for people with acquired brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2011</LINK>). A reason for the discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the current review applied more rigorous inclusion criteria than the two narrative reviews. In <LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2011</LINK>, for example, six of the eight studies reviewed were class III studies. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Cappa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappa 2005</LINK> included non-RCTs as a source of acceptable evidence. An additional reason for the discrepancy could be that the narrative reviews mainly included participants with head injury rather than stroke. It is currently unclear whether different underlying pathologies (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury) have different effects on outcome.</P>

<P>The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits following stroke remains unconfirmed. Cognitive rehabilitation may improve some specific aspects of attention in the short term. There was no evidence to indicate whether the benefits persist in the long term. However, improving attention in the short term may enable people to engage better in rehabilitation and improve their ability to cope with tasks in which they are required to do two things at the same time, such as walking and talking. It is important that when rehabilitation for attention is carried out the benefits are monitored, as at present no specific rehabilitation approach can be recommended.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-16 10:54:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is sufficient evidence to suggest there may be some benefits of cognitive rehabilitation for attentional problems after stroke and that further trials are needed. However, there are few studies and the quality is not consistently high. This may be partly because cognitive rehabilitation is not routinely provided in many rehabilitation settings. It is therefore important that more randomised trials are carried out to inform clinical practice. Outcomes need to be assessed on general indices of attention and the effect on functional abilities determined. The long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation need to be evaluated in addition to short-term effects. There needs to be more attention to both the design of methodologically sound studies and reporting that conforms with the CONSORT guidelines. Trialists are encouraged to refer to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) for the description of the key features of trials that need to be reported. In addition, trials need to have adequate power to detect clinically meaningful differences between groups. It is important that such evaluations are carried out as the best ways to improve cognition after stroke were one of the top 10 research priorities relating to life after stroke reported by people with stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is ongoing and the authors would like to receive information on ongoing trials for a future update.</P>

<P>RCT, parallel group design</P>
<P>3 people who did not take part in the study performed the randomisation. Small identical paper notes with numbers corresponding to each of the participants were put in a bucket.

Before the procedure it was determined that all participants drawn by the first person would be in the training group, and the participants drawn by the other person were controls. The principal investigator (not involved in randomisation process) had the key to the correspondence between the numbers and the participant names. The result of the randomisation was kept secret from the therapists. After the first neuropsychological assessment (T1) a sealed, pre-named envelope, which revealed the randomisation to either the treatment or control group condition, was opened by the therapist so that the participants could have the instructions for their intervention</P>
