<TITLE>Needling for encapsulated trabeculectomy filtering blebs</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-12 12:46:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Trabeculectomy is an eye operation aimed at reducing intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma. A bleb usually forms at the site of operation, indicating aqueous drainage from the eyes. Trabeculectomy blebs can become encapsulated leading to poor drainage and high intraocular pressure. Some ophthalmologists needle encapsulated blebs in order to re-establish drainage and lower intraocular pressure. However, needling is invasive and can potentially be associated with higher risks of complications, such as anterior chamber collapse, infections, and cataract. This review included one trial conducted in Brazil which randomised 25 eyes. The trial compared needling using a 27-gauge needle to medical treatment with aqueous suppressants and digital massage. Outcome measures in the trial were mean intraocular pressure and successful intraocular pressure control (defined arbitrarily as IOP less than 20 mmHg). This review found no conclusive evidence that needling of encapsulated blebs results in better intra-ocular pressure control than antiglaucoma medication.</P>

<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised in which bleb needling was compared with any form of antiglaucoma medication in people with encapsulated trabeculectomy blebs.

<P>One trial, which randomised 25 eyes to either needling or medical treatment, met the inclusion criteria. At one day post-treatment, mean intraocular pressure was lower in the needling group (16.28 mmHg, standard deviation 5.9) than the medical group (19.45 mmHg, standard deviation 3.75). The difference was not statistically significant. At all other follow-up points, mean intraocular pressure was consistently higher in the needling group than the medical group, although the differences were not statistically significant.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Trabeculectomy (filtration surgery) is a surgical procedure that aims to reduce intraocular pressure (fluid pressure within the eye) (IOP) in people with glaucoma. This is achieved by creating a channel through which aqueous humour (fluid in the front of the eye) can drain out of the eye. A bleb (elevated conjunctiva) is formed at the site of surgery. This helps to regulate the amount of aqueous that drains from the eye and hence control the intraocular pressure. Aqueous leaving the eye in this way is gradually absorbed through the veins and lymphatics of the conjunctiva. Small amounts may pass directly into the tear film. The presence of a diffuse raised bleb with a reduction of IOP is regarded as indicative of adequate drainage and successful glaucoma surgery. Other signs of adequate drainage include microcysts.</P>
<P>Encapsulation of the filtering bleb may lead to elevation of IOP in the early postoperative period, prompting further medical or surgical intervention. Bleb encapsulation can occur in up to 13% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Sherwood-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherwood 1987</LINK>). Encapsulated blebs have characteristic clinical features. They are often localised with an elevated or dome-shaped appearance. The bleb has a thickened wall (Tenons cyst) often with dilated surface blood vessels and no microcysts. These features and a persistently raised IOP define an encapsulated bleb and distinguish it from a failed or scarred bleb.</P>
<P>Signs of a failed bleb include a flat and injected conjunctiva often with subconjunctival fibrosis sometimes with thin walled cystic spaces. The IOP remains consistently elevated. Failure of the bleb by scarring usually occurs later although in one retrospective study, most blebs if they are going to fail will do so in the first 18 months (<LINK REF="REF-Lavin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavin 1990</LINK>). This review concerns the needling of encapsulated blebs only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The management of bleb encapsulation associated with elevated intraocular pressure is controversial. Bleb obstruction from encapsulation has been described as a transient phase requiring medical treatment to control IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1988</LINK>). Others advocate digital massage associated with medical treatment as the initial management (<LINK REF="REF-Sherwood-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherwood 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van_x002d_Buskirk-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van-Buskirk 1982</LINK>). It has been suggested that needling of an encapsulated bleb (a form of surgical intervention) may be effective in re-establishing drainage and lowering IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Greenfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenfield 1996</LINK>). It has also been reported that the use of antimetabolites at the time of needling could improve results (<LINK REF="REF-Ewing-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewing 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mardelli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardelli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Bleb needling may be performed as an outpatient slit-lamp procedure or may be done in the operating theatre. It is essential to perform a gonioscopic examination before initial bleb needling to exclude mechanical blockage of the artificial channel of the trabeculectomy. The technique of bleb needling may vary slightly from surgeon to surgeon but basically involves introducing a 24 to 30 gauge needle under the conjunctiva about 10 mm from the assumed site of aqueous obstruction. Some surgeons advance the needle under the sclera flap and make sweeping motions of the needle tip to break down adhesions or remove obstructions at the drainage site until a raised conjunctiva bleb is formed. This procedure may be repeated, or followed by the injection of antimetabolites to reduce healing and scarring around the bleb site.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Successful needling of failed blebs makes it unnecessary to recommence patients on antiglaucoma medication. While bleb needling may re-establish drainage of aqueous, it is relatively invasive compared to medical treatment and may lead to complications such as over-drainage and anterior chamber collapse (collapse of the front of the eye). Other complications may include infection, cataract formation or progression. Despite these potential complications and disputed benefit, bleb needling is commonly performed.</P>

<P>The trial randomised eyes to either needling or medical treatment with aqueous suppressants and digital massage. Needling was carried out under local anaesthesia using a 27-gauge needle. Medical treatment was introduced if needling failed to control IOP below 20 mmHg. If this failed, surgical revision or further glaucoma surgery was performed. This was compared with medical treatment consisting of digital massage and non-specific betablockers, with or without systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-06-12 12:47:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intraocular pressure</HEADING>
<P>The single trial in this study did not show a significant difference in the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) between the needling and medical groups at any follow-up interval. With the exception of day one, mean IOP was higher at all follow-up times in the needling group.</P>
<P>Although successful IOP control was not documented as an outcome in our protocol, we note that this outcome was reported in the trial included in this review. It is interesting that medical treatment resulted in a significantly higher success rate than needling given the fact that the difference in mean IOPs between the groups were not statistically significant at any intervals in the follow-up. The definition of success in this trial as IOP less than 20 mmHg could account for this paradox. For example, an eye with an IOP of 19 mmHg in the medical group would be regarded as achieving successful IOP control, whereas an eye with an IOP of 20 mmHg in the needling group would be regarded as unsuccessful, even though the difference between the two pressures is small and not statistically significant. Furthermore, eyes in the medical group also received a massage and this may have contributed to the higher 'success rate'. The effectiveness of massage in reducing IOP has not been quantified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mean number of antiglaucoma medications</HEADING>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of antiglaucoma drugs between the needling and medical groups. Again, this is surprising given the fact that the number of eyes in the needling group achieved significantly lower success rates compared to the medical group, and thus a higher mean number of additional antiglaucoma medications would be expected in the needling group. We have no explanation for this finding other than that due to the arbitrary definition of success in this trial as described above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Visual acuity loss and adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The cataractogenic effect generally believed to be associated with invasive eye procedures has not been demonstrated in this trial. There was no statistically significant difference in visual loss due to cataract between the needling and medical groups. Other potential adverse effects such as endophthalmitis, bleb leaks or shallow anterior chambers that can occur following needling were not reported in the trial. A larger sample size would have been needed to confirm the apparent safety of this procedure. No report is provided of patient perspective, particularly regarding discomfort of needling or intolerance of topical medication.</P>
<P>Although the trial in this review suggests a poor effect of bleb needling compared to antiglaucoma medication, doubt remains as to whether the trial had enough power to detect a significant effect given the small number of eyes randomised. Power calculations were not reported in the trial and attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful. <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1988</LINK> suggests the beneficial effects of medical management of encysted blebs. In a retrospective review of 181 eyes, 18 developed encysted blebs and were managed without needling. His argument that this was a high bleb phase best managed by medical treatment would seem to support the findings of this trial. <LINK REF="REF-Richter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 1988</LINK>, however, observed in his series that 15 of 56 eyes (26.8%) with encapsulated blebs ultimately required surgical revision because maximally tolerated medical therapy was insufficient to control IOP.</P>
<P>Anecdotal evidence of the apparent usefulness of bleb needling may be due to the concomitant use of antimetabolites during and after needling. This may improve IOP control as some reports have suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Shin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 1993</LINK>). Other studies report the need to repeatedly needle encapsulated blebs to achieve a satisfactory IOP control. Variation in technique of needling may also influence IOP control. The use of larger needles for needling and the technique of subscleral flap needling can affect IOP outcomes. Variable success rates have been reported for needling of blebs that have failed for reasons other than encapsulation although there are no reported randomised controlled studies in this group.</P>
<P>This review was limited by the fact that only one trial was included. A meta-analysis of several good quality randomised controlled trials would have allowed for a more precise and meaningful estimate of the effect of needling of encapsulated blebs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The single trial in this review suggests that a single needling procedure of encapsulated blebs offers no better intraocular pressure control than medical management. Clinicians must weigh up the potential risk to benefit ratio when deciding to needle encapsulated blebs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Despite the lack of evidence for the effect of bleb needling the procedure is commonly performed. Best available evidence is limited to the outcome from a single randomised trial. There is a need for more randomised controlled trials to validate the findings of this single trial and provide more information on the role and safety of needling in the management of encapsulated blebs. The adjuvant use of antimetabolite with needling requires examination. The role of digital massage in bleb remodelling needs further evaluation.</P>
