<TITLE>Strontium ranelate for osteoporosis in women after menopause</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-27 22:52:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of strontium ranelate for osteoporosis in women after menopause. The review shows that:<BR/>There is silver level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) that for treatment of osteoporosis in women after menopause, 2 g of strontium ranelate daily over 3 years decreases fractures in the spine and slightly decreases fractures not in the spine. Most women do not have side effects that would cause them to stop taking strontium ranelate. However, other research shows that harms could include a chance of blood clots and seizures, memory loss and consciousness.</P>
<P>
<B>What is osteoporosis and how can strontium ranelate help?</B>
</P>
<P>Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone loss occurs. Bone loss leads to weak brittle bones that can break easily, even during everyday activities. Breaks (fractures) of the spine or non-spine (e.g. wrist and hip) are the most common type. There are many drugs and minerals that work to treat osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate is a drug that decreases the chance of fractures by slowing the loss of bone and possibly by building new bone. It is a new drug and therefore its benefits and harms need to be known.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the results of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>Women in the studies took 2 g of strontium ranelate or a placebo (fake tablets or powder). After 2 to 3 years, the number of fractures that occurred and bone mineral density was measured. Bone mineral density is a lab test to measure how dense or strong bones are in the hip, spine or neck. The higher the bone density the better.</P>
<P>
<B>Benefits of strontium ranelate</B>
</P>
<P>In women after menopause who have osteoporosis:</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate decreases spine fractures:</P>
<P>13 out of 100 women had spine fractures taking strontium ranelate<BR/>
</P>
<P>21 out of 100 women had spine fractures taking a placebo</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate may decrease fractures that are not in the spine:<BR/>
</P>
<P>10 out of 100 women had non-spine fractures taking strontium ranelate<BR/>
</P>
<P>12 out of 100 women had non-spine fractures taking a placebo</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate increases bone mineral density<BR/>
</P>
<P>1 in 3 women had an increase in spine and hip bone mineral density taking strontium ranelate<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Harms of strontium ranelate</B>
</P>
<P>In women after menopause who have osteoporosis:<BR/>
</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate did not cause side effects that would make them stop taking it<BR/>
</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate did not lead to serious side effects, stomach infections, back pain or death<BR/>
</P>
<P>- strontium ranelate increased diarrhea</P>
<P>6 out of 100 women had diarrhea taking strontium ranelate</P>
<P>4 out of 100 women had diarrhea taking a placebo</P>
<P>Other research shows that harms could include a chance of blood clots, and seizures, memory loss and consciousness. The cause of these vascular and neurological side effects are not known.<BR/>
</P>
<P>This review has several limitations which include difficulty interpreting the change in bone mineral density due to the unique aspects of strontium in bone as well, incomplete follow-up of some patients within the individual trials.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Strontium ranelate is a new treatment for osteoporosis therefore, its benefits and harms need to be known.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1996-March 2005), EMBASE (1996-week 9 2005), the Cochrane Library (1996-Issue 1 2005), reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings from the last two years. Additional data was sought from authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year duration comparing strontium ranelate to placebo and reporting fracture incidence, bone mineral density (BMD) or adverse events in postmenopausal women. Treatment population was defined as women with prevalent vertebral fractures and/or lumbar spine BMD T-score &lt; -2.5 SD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility, assessed study validity, graded the evidence and extracted relevant data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. RCTs were grouped by dose and treatment duration. Where possible, meta-analysis was conducted using the random effects model. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials met the inclusion criteria. Three had losses to follow-up &gt; 20% and only one provided an adequate description of allocation concealment. Three included a treatment population (0.5 to 2 g/day of strontium ranelate) and one a prevention population (0.125, 0.5 and 1 g/day). A 37% reduction in vertebral fractures (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56, 0.71), and a 14% reduction in non-vertebral fractures with the upper boundary of the confidence interval approaching one (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75, 0.98), were demonstrated over three years with 2 g of strontium ranelate daily in a treatment population. An increase in BMD was shown at all sites after two to three years of treatment in both populations. Lower doses of strontium ranelate were superior to placebo and the highest dose demonstrated the greatest reduction in vertebral fractures and increase in BMD. An increased risk of diarrhea with 2 g of strontium ranelate daily was found; however, adverse events did not affect the risk of discontinuing treatment nor did it increase the risk of serious side effects, gastritis or death. Additional data suggests that the risk of vascular and nervous system side-effects is increased with taking 2 g of strontium ranelate daily over three to four years. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is silver level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) to support the efficacy of strontium ranelate for the reduction of fractures (vertebral and to a lesser extent, non-vertebral) in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and an increase in BMD in postmenopausal women with/without osteoporosis. Diarrhea may occur, however, adverse events leading to study withdrawal were not significantly increased. Potential vascular and neurological side-effects need to be further explored.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone resulting in an increase in bone fragility and risk of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-_x0031_993-Consensus" TYPE="REFERENCE">1993 Consensus</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2001</LINK>). It most often affects postmenopausal women as reductions in circulating levels of estrogen lead to accelerated bone turnover and resorption. The most common sites of osteoporotic fracture are the wrist, hip and spine however, osteoporotic fractures do occur at other sites (<LINK REF="REF-Seeley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeley 1991</LINK>). Osteoporotic fractures are a major burden for the individual, their families and society (<LINK REF="REF-Johnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>). Individuals who suffer osteoporotic fractures, particularly spine or hip, must deal with the complications which include reductions in health-related quality-adjusted life years, increased morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tosteson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tosteson 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, the direct and indirect expenditures associated with the care of these individuals, particularly hip fracture patients, is costly (<LINK REF="REF-US-Dept-Health-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Dept Health 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1997</LINK>). In Europe, the number of osteoporotic fractures was estimated to be 3.79 million in 2000 and the associated total direct costs were 31.7 billion Euros (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2004</LINK>). In the United States, approximately 1.5 million osteoporotic fractures occur each year (<LINK REF="REF-US-Dept-Health-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Dept Health 2004</LINK>) and the cost of fractures was estimated to be 20 billion US dollars in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1997</LINK>). With the aging of the population, and the age-specific increases in osteoporotic fracture rates, it has been suggested that these costs will more than double in the coming decades (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The bone fragility which characterizes this disease is a result of an imbalance in bone remodeling (bone resorption exceeds bone formation) and an increase in the rate of remodeling at the tissue level (<LINK REF="REF-Seeman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeman 2002</LINK>). Risk factors associated with fragility fracture include advancing age, prior fragility fracture, family history of osteoporosis/fracture and low bone mineral density (BMD) (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). A working group of the World Health Organization in 1994 proposed that an individual with a BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the young adult mean has osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, it has been estimated that for every one SD reduction of BMD, there is an increase in relative risk of fracture of approximately 1.5 to 2.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Effective therapies are available and have been demonstrated to reduce the relative risk of fracture by 40 to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2002</LINK>). Pharmacotherapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis includes two primary types of drugs, anti resorptive and anabolic agents. Anti resorptive agents increase bone strength by decreasing the number of bone multicellular units. This reduces resorption and prevents further structural damage of trabecular bone and by reducing cortical porosity. In contrast, anabolic agents increase bone strength by increasing bone mass due to an increase in the number of bone multicellular units. As result the magnitude of the formation phase is greater than the resorption phase (<LINK REF="REF-Riggs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riggs 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>The majority of the agents currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis are anti resorptive (e.g. bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen modulators and calcitonin) and there are a few anabolic agents (e.g. intermittent recombinant human parathyroid hormone and fluoride) (<LINK REF="STD-Sorbera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbera 2003</LINK>). A novel oral agent, strontium ranelate, has been suggested to simultaneously decrease bone resorption and stimulate bone formation although there is some controversy surrounding its mechanism of action. </P>
<P>Strontium ranelate consists of two divalent cation atoms of stable strontium (natural element) and an organic moiety (ranelic acid) which dissociates at the gastro-intestinal level. Strontium is a cation (i.e. positively charged ion) and physically closely related to calcium, an active component of the skeleton. Ranelic acid is an organic, highly polar molecule without pharmacological activity (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>). In vitro, strontium ranelate has been suggested to have a dual effect on bone; however, in vivo long term dosing of strontium ranelate in OVX rats and monkeys resulted in increased bone formation but non-significant trends of bone resorption. In human studies (phase III trials), there is some evidence of increases in bone formation markers (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) and decreases in markers of bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide cross links) from the third month of treatment (2 g of strontium ranelate daily) up to three years. Potential mechanisms of action include activation of calcium-sensing receptor or induction of cellular differentiation. The proposed indication is for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in order to reduce the risk of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Different doses of strontium ranelate have been tested. In a two year randomized controlled trial doses from 0.5 g to 2 g per day were tested in 353 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>) and in another two year randomized controlled trial, doses from 0.125 g to 1 g per day were evaluated in 160 early postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>). In both trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was BMD and results showed a clear dose response. All tested doses were superior to placebo with the highest dose of strontium ranelate (2 g per day) demonstrating the greatest increase in BMD after adjusting for bone strontium content over two years (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2003_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2003-1</LINK>). As a result, 2 g of strontium ranelate per day is considered the recommended daily dose and was the only dose evaluated in the two phase III trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Given the potential advantages of strontium ranelate in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and that it is a new therapeutic agent, it is important that the benefits and harms of this therapy are fully explored through a systematic review of the literature. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis compared to placebo or active comparator in postmenopausal women through a systematic review of the literature. The following major endpoints were used for this purpose: 1) Fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral); 2) BMD; 3) Health related quality of life and; 4) Safety. A treatment (versus prevention) population was defined as postmenopausal women with prevalent vertebral fractures and/or lumbar spine BMD T score &lt; -2.5 SD.<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized placebo or active comparator-controlled trials of at least one year duration were included in this review. Studies were excluded if they were not truly randomized (e.g. patients randomized using date of birth) but not on the basis of language of publication. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Postmenopausal women, in which menopause was either surgically or naturally induced, were included. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials that investigated the effect of strontium ranelate versus placebo or an active comparator were included however, trials that investigated multiple interventions where the effect of strontium ranelate could not be separated out were not included. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Efficacy measures:</P>
<P>1. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of women with incident vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (a feasible outcome for a treatment population). Asymptomatic vertebral fractures were included if they were either quantitatively or semi-quantitatively ascertained via a radiographic examination as well, symptomatic (or clinical) vertebral fractures as defined by acute back pain and radiographic findings were also included. Non-vertebral fractures included all appendicular type fractures except fractures of the coccyx, skull, jaw, face, ankle, fingers or toes as they are not considered to be osteoporotic related (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>2. The secondary efficacy outcome to fractures (or surrogate outcome) was the mean percent change in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and yearly intervals (a relevant outcome for both prevention and treatment populations). Strontium ranelate has a higher atomic number than calcium. When present in bone as it attenuates x-rays to a greater extent than calcium resulting in an overestimation of BMD as measured by DXA (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 2005</LINK>). As a result, BMD measurements should be adjusted for strontium content in order to avoid such an artifactual increase in BMD. The correction used to adjust for the strontium content in bone in the lumbar spine BMD measurements has been described as an indirect method and based on: 1) the correlation between the strontium content measured in the iliac crest on bone biopsy and the area under the curve of the integrated strontium plasma curve; and 2) the correlation between the bone strontium content measured in lumbar vertebrae and the iliac crest in monkeys. However, given that no correlation has been established between femoral neck and iliac crest bone strontium content is not adjusted for at the other BMD sites (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>3. Health Related Quality of Life (a relevant outcome for a treatment population).</P>
<P>4. Safety measures include the following (relevant for both prevention and treatment populations):<BR/>i) Total withdrawals (the total number of withdrawals after enrolment in the study).<BR/>ii) Withdrawals due to adverse events (withdrawals as a result of an adverse event)<BR/>iii) Number of emergent adverse events (adverse events that developed during the study). <BR/>iv) Serious adverse events (adverse events that were immediately life-threatening, or resulted in hospitalization, disability, malignant disease or death) (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>). <BR/>v) Number of adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal system (e.g. diarrhea or gastritis)<BR/>vi) Deaths</P>

<P>Strontium ranelate is a relatively new drug and it was anticipated that most of the trials would have been published in the past five years therefore, our search focused on this time period only. Our search aimed to identify all trials of strontium ranelate for either the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and we employed the following approaches (based on Cochrane search strategy outlined by Robinson and Dickersin) (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>An electronic search of MEDLINE (1996 to March 2005), EMBASE (1996 to week 9 2005) and the Cochrane Library (1996 to Issue 1 2005). Our search strategy included MeSH terms such as osteoporosis, postmenopausal and strontium ranelate in addition, complementary free text words. We limited the search to randomized controlled trials and supplemented it to include previously completed systematic reviews. </LI>

<P>
<B>Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction:</B>
<BR/>The bibliographic record (i.e. title, authors, keywords and abstract) retrieved from the search were assessed by two independent reviewers (SO'D, AC) for potential eligibility based on the review's a priori eligibility criteria. Those records deemed potentially eligible, or those in which there was not enough information, underwent a full text review to confirm their inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers (SO'D, AC) using a validated instrument by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). This checklist includes three items pertaining to descriptions of randomization, blinding, and the inclusion of data for dropouts and withdrawals, with a total score of five. Studies with a score less than or equal to two were considered low quality studies. Allocation concealment was also evaluated by two independent reviewers (SO'D, AC) using the allocation component of a validated instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). As outlined in the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook, the allocation concealment was determined to be: A) adequate i.e. central randomization; numbered or coded bottles or containers; drugs prepared by the pharmacy; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained elements convincing of concealment, B) unclear i.e. authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or reported an approach that was neither adequate nor inadequate, C) inadequate i.e. alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth, and D) not used. Next, data were independently extracted by both reviewers (SO'D, AC) using a data extraction form designed specifically for this review. Details of the study population, duration of intervention, baseline demographic data, and the outcomes were collected. Differences with respect to article eligibility, quality assessment and data extraction were resolved by referring to the original publication and establishing consensus (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Grading the strength of the evidence per outcome:</B>
<BR/>We used the ribbon grading system as described in the 2004 Evidence-based Rheumatology <I>BMJ </I>book (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>) to grade the strength of the evidence per outcome. The ribbon grading system uses four categories to rank the evidence from research studies: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. The ranking is given according to different criteria, including sample size, blinding, handling of withdrawals and concealment allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>). The ranking of the efficacy outcomes (i.e. fractures and BMD) is included in the synopsis, abstract, methodological quality of included studies and the clinical relevance tables (see Additional Tables - 01 and 02) of this review. </P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis: <BR/>
</B>Prior to the pooling, we developed hypotheses that might account for heterogeneity of study results and compared groups according to: 1) treatment duration, 2) dose and, 3) prevention versus treatment populations. Where possible, the analyses were based on intention-to-treat data from the individual clinical trials. For fractures and safety outcomes, a weighted relative risk was determined for the number of women with either incident fractures or adverse events using Review Manager 4.2.7 (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>). For BMD, a weighted mean difference (WMD) of the percent change between treatment and control groups for different BMD sites including lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip was calculated. Analyses of the four trials were conducted using an available data set as it was not possible to carry out an intention to treat analysis with the published data. Meta-analysis was conducted according to random effects model. Heterogeneity of the treatment effect was calculated using a chi-square test with n -1 degrees of freedom; where n is the number of studies and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In addition to relative measures, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) was calculated and for those outcomes that were statistically significant, the number needed to treat (NNT) was determined. The NNT was calculated by taking the inverse of the ARR (NNT = 1/ARR) where ARR is the control event rate minus the treatment event rate. These results are summarized in the clinical relevance tables of this review (see Additional Tables - 01 and 02). </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of 80 potentially relevant studies were identified from the electronic and hand search strategy outlined above and screened for retrieval. Of these, 62 were excluded as they did not meet the review's eligibility criteria and 18 underwent a full text review (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_3" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boivin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boivin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naveau-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Naveau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pors-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pors 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2003_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2003-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2003_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2003-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2004-1</LINK>; Sorbera 2003; <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marquis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquis 2005</LINK>).

The remaining five studies met our eligibility criteria, four of which were primary studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and one, an abstract, that was a companion paper to the included study by Meuneir et al., 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Marquis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquis 2005</LINK>). There was no previous systematic review on this topic. </P>
<P>All four included primary studies were randomized placebo controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). Three investigated the efficacy of strontium ranelate in a treatment population (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and one included a prevention population (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>). The mean age of the postmenopausal women studied ranged from 54.2 (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>) to 76.7 years (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). None of the women had a previous vertebral fracture in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>), approximately half had a prior vertebral fracture in one (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and all of the women had a prior vertebral fracture in two (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>).

All four studies included a calcium supplement in both treatment and control groups which ranged in dose from 500 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>) to 1000 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) daily. In three trials, women in the treatment and control groups also received vitamin D supplements which ranged from 400 to 800 IU daily based on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>) or 800 IU daily (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>).

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Jadad instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Quality scores, percent lost to follow-up and allocation concealment grades are summarized in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table of this review. All four studies were adequately reported as randomized and described adequate methods regarding the sequence of randomization. All reported that the trial was double blind. Of these, two indicated that the recipients of care were unaware of their assigned intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). One reported that the persons responsible for assessing outcomes were unaware of the assigned intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>). And one reported that the recipients, those providing the care and persons responsible for assessing outcomes were all unaware of the assigned intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>). A description of withdrawals was adequately provided in all four studies. All trials had a methodological quality score of greater than three out five on the Jadad checklist (mean 4.25, range 4-5). However, despite their adequate overall quality scores, three of the included studies had losses to follow-up greater than 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and only one provided an adequate description of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>). Lastly, the analyses of the four trials were conducted using an available analysis set, which is not preferred but close to the intention to treat' principle (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>). For the efficacy outcomes of this review (fractures and BMD), a "silver" level of evidence has been assigned as none of the randomized trials met all of the criteria required for a gold level ranking i.e. sample size of at least 50 in each group, blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes, loss to follow-up &lt; 20% and adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>). </P>

The results from this trial demonstrated a 52% relative reduction in risk of a symptomatic fracture (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.80) over a one year period and a 38% relative reduction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.83) over three years. </P>
<P>With respect to the lower doses of strontium ranelate, one trial demonstrated a 31% relative reduction in radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women using 0.5 g of strontium ranelate versus placebo per day over a two year period however, this was not statistically significant (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>). The same study showed a 6% relative reduction in radiographic vertebral fractures using 1.0 g of strontium ranelate daily over the same time frame again, this was not statistically significant (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.30) (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>). </P>

<P>One study (n = 4932) reported on 'major osteoporotic non-vertebral fractures' defined as fractures of the wrist, pelvis and sacrum, ribs-sternum, clavicle, humerus or hip only in women with osteoporosis and found a 19% relative reduction taking 2 g strontium ranelate daily compared to placebo although the upper boundary of the confidence interval approached one (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no studies that evaluated the effects of lower doses of strontium ranelate on the incidence of non-vertebral fractures. </P>

<U>Hip:</U>
<BR/>There was only one trial that assessed the efficacy of 2 g of strontium ranelate per day versus placebo on the relative reduction of hip fractures in women with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) therefore, we were unable to estimate a pooled relative risk. Hip fractures, similar to other non-vertebral fractures, were determined by a radiological evaluation or by a report from a hospitalization. After three years, the relative risk reduction of hip fractures was 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.19) in the total group of women (n=4932) versus 36% for a subgroup at high risk of hip fracture (n=1977) defined by age <U>&gt;</U> 74 years and a femoral neck BMD T-score <U>&lt;</U> - 3 (<LINK REF="REF-Looker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looker 1991</LINK>) (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.412 to 0.997).

</U>Using 2 g of strontium ranelate daily versus placebo, an increase in lumbar spine BMD was demonstrated in osteoporotic women over a two year period (two trials, n = 1614, WMD adjusted for strontium content 5.44, 95% CI 3.41 to 7.46 and WMD, not adjusted for strontium content 11.29, 95% CI 10.22 to 12.37) (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>). However, the chi-square test for heterogeneity of treatment effect was significant for the analysis involving the results adjusted for strontium content (p=0.04) and I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76.6%. We investigated sources of clinical heterogeneity and a possible explanation relates to the difference in timing and methods of the strontium content calculation from bone-biopsy samples between the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>). Based on pooled estimates, the number needed to treat was 3 for lumbar spine BMD adjusted for strontium content at 2 years. This means that 3 women would have to be treated with strontium ranelate for one of them to have a minimal clinically important improvement in lumbar spine BMD after 2 years. There was only one trial (n=1442) that investigated the effects of 2 g of strontium ranelate daily versus placebo in osteoporotic women on lumbar spine BMD over a three year period and the WMD demonstrated an increase in lumbar spine BMD relative to placebo (WMD adjusted for strontium content 8.09, 95% CI 7.22 to 8.96 and WMD not adjusted for strontium content 14.39, 95% CI 13.40 to 15.38) (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of the lower doses of strontium ranelate, one study (n=63) investigated the effects of 0.125 g of strontium ranelate daily versus placebo on women without osteoporosis and found a non-significant increase in lumbar spine BMD over a two year period (WMD not adjusted for strontium content 0.37, 95% CI -1.57 to 2.31) (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>). Women, with and without osteoporosis, taking 0.5 g of strontium ranelate daily compared to placebo showed a non-significant increase in lumbar spine BMD over a two year period when BMD was adjusted for strontium content (two trials, n = 232, WMD 1.01, 95% CI -0.63 to 2.66). However, when BMD was not adjusted for strontium content, the increase was significant (WMD 3.59, 95% CI 1.66 to 5.51) (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2002_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2002-1</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>A total of four trials met our inclusion criteria, three of which investigated the effects of strontium ranelate compared to placebo in a treatment population (doses ranged from 0.5 to 2 g daily) and one, in a prevention population (doses 0.125, 0.5 and 1 g daily). The included studies were presumably conducted in calcium and vitamin D replete postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>There is silver level evidence to support the use of 2 g of strontium ranelate daily in osteoporotic postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of vertebral and to a lesser extent, non-vertebral fractures. The pooled estimate of the relative risk for vertebral and non-vertebral fractures over a three year follow-up period were consistent with a reduction of 37% for vertebral fractures and 14% for non-vertebral fractures however, the upper boundary of the confidence interval for the effect on non-vertebral fractures was close to one. Both estimates were statistically significant and there was little heterogeneity of treatment effect however, the upper boundary of the confidence interval of the non-vertebral fractures approached one indicating that the data may be consistent with a null effect. Furthermore, the impact that 2 g of strontium ranelate daily has on reducing the risk of a hip fracture remains unclear as the only included study with data was not powered for this outcome. Although data from direct comparisons with other anti-osteoporotic treatments are lacking, the reduction in the relative risk of vertebral fracture seems similar to the other available therapies which have been shown to reduce the relative risk of recurrent fracture by 40 to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2002</LINK>). The greater reduction in risk of vertebral fractures compared to non-vertebral fractures may be explained by the greater effect that strontium ranelate has on the vertebral versus non-vertebral bone mineral density. </P>
<P>In the TROPOS trial, the primary end point (i.e. all non-vertebral fractures) was recorded in 233 patients on strontium ranelate and 276 on placebo over a three-year period (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>). As stated in the EMEA, the incidence of patients experiencing non-vertebral fracture(s) over a three year period using the Kaplan-Meier method and an unadjusted Cox model for inference demonstrated that strontium ranelate was not associated with a RR reduction as the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval was 1.01 (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>). Whereas in the primary paper for the TROPOS trial, the incidence of patients experiencing non-vertebral fracture(s) estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox model adjusting for age, femoral neck BMD, body mass index and country demonstrated that strontium ranelate was associated with a RR reduction of 16% (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.702 to 0.995) however, the upper boundary of the confidence interval was close to one (<LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). Given that the significant effect on non-vertebral fractures was found upon adjusting for the specified covariates was only marginal, it would appear that adjusting for these potentially relevant covariates did not have a significant impact on the direction of the effect and not likely clinically relevant. </P>
<P>The results of this review support the use of 2 g of strontium ranelate daily in osteoporotic postmenopausal women for increasing BMD at all sites over a two to three year period. In a prevention population, 1 g of strontium ranelate daily was demonstrated to increase BMD at all sites compared to placebo over a two year period. In both the treatment and prevention populations, lower doses of strontium ranelate were superior to placebo with the highest dose of strontium ranelate demonstrating the greatest increase in BMD over a two year period. While the increase in BMD in patients taking 2 g of strontium ranelate daily is impressive, caution is necessary when in interpreting these results. As previously mentioned, the combined effect of strontium distribution in bone and increased x-ray absorption of strontium compared to calcium leads to an amplification of BMD measurement by DXA (<LINK REF="REF-Ortolani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortolani 2006</LINK>). While the included trials described and performed a correction to adjust for the strontium content in bone for the lumbar spine BMD measurements, there is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of the results which arises from the small number of participants in whom iliac crest bone biopsy was performed and the reliance on animal data for the correction factor for inferring bone strontium content in the spine (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although limited, there is evidence from one phase III trial to suggest that 2 g of strontium ranelate daily compared to placebo has a beneficial effect on health related quality of life in a subset of postmenopausal women (n=1240) after three years of treatment. In keeping with this, results from a back pain assessment included in the quality of life questionnaire revealed that the occurrence of back pain was significantly reduced by 29% in the strontium ranelate group as compared to the placebo group over three years with a significant effect in the first year (p = 0.006) (<LINK REF="REF-Marquis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquis 2005</LINK>). These findings are presumably due to a reduction in the consequences related to osteoporosis such as vertebral fractures. </P>
<P>Overall incidence rates for adverse events with strontium ranelate did not differ from placebo regardless of dose. There was a statistically significant increase in the risk for diarrhea in patients treated with 2 g of strontium ranelate daily relative to placebo. However; there was no significant difference in the number of withdrawals due to side effects, number of emergent events, serious adverse events, gastritis or deaths regardless of the dose analyzed. Additional data obtained from the scientific report by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>), in addition to the industry sponsor (Servier), has illustrated an increased risk in vascular and neurological disorders as well as abnormal laboratory findings. This information is based on results from the two phase III trials which focused on the recommended dose of 2 g of strontium ranelate daily (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and has been summarized below and within the appended table entitled "Other adverse events from additional sources" (see Additional Tables -03). </P>
<P>Disorders of the vascular system were present in 26.3% of the patients in the strontium ranelate group versus 24.4% in the placebo; Estimated difference = 1.9% (95% CI -0.2 to 4.0) with an increased reporting rate of adverse events of venous thromboembolism (2.2% versus 1.5%, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1) and pulmonary embolism (0.8% versus 4.5%, OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.1) over a three year period. Furthermore, the absolute number of patients that suffered a pulmonary embolism resulting in discontinuation of treatment or death was increased in the strontium ranelate group compared to controls (i.e. 0.2% versus 0.1%). The cause of this increased risk of vascular disorders is not understood. Nervous system disorders were found in 20.9% of the patients in the strontium ranelate group versus 18.9% in the placebo; Estimated difference = 2.0 % (95% CI 0.1 to 3.9) with an increased reporting of seizures (0.3% versus 0.1%), memory loss (2.4% versus 1.9%) and disturbances in consciousness (2.5% versus 2.0%) over a four year period. Again, the etiology of the increased risk in neurological disorders is not clear. Lastly, mean baseline serum creatine kinase levels increased in both groups however, this increase was significantly greater in the strontium ranelate group (31.3 <U>+</U> 80.8 IU/L) compared to the controls (13.1 <U>+</U> 46.6 IU/L); Estimated difference = 18.2 IU/L (95% CI 14.8 to 21.6). The serum creatine kinase levels was greater than the upper limit of normal on at least one occasion in 29.4% (789/2680) of the women in the strontium ranelate group versus 17.6% (475/2705) of the controls (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.85) providing evidence of strontium ranelate impacting skeletal muscle cell integrity however, the clinical relevance of these results is not known. In light of these findings targeted surveillance will be needed (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Since the main route of elimination of strontium is the kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1973</LINK>), the risk for side effects due to an increased accumulation of strontium in the bone needs to be considered in individuals whose renal function is compromised. Strontium has been shown to have a causal role (dose-dependent) in the development of osteomalacia in rats with chronic renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Schrooten-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrooten 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schrooten-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrooten 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oste-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oste 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, D'Haese et al found an association between increased bone strontium levels and the presence of osteomalacia from 100 biopsies of hemodialysis patients from various geographic areas however, further studies are required to establish if strontium plays a contributory role (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haese-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haese 2000</LINK>). In the Summary of Product Characteristics, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment based on the fact that the mean creatine clearance in the Phase III trials was approximately. 50 ml/min. However, due to the absence of bone safety data in patients with severe renal impairment, it is recommended that strontium ranelate not be used in this particular patient population (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Our systematic review has several limitations. Firstly, while the methodological quality of the included studies was high based on the Jadad instrument, three of the four studies had losses to follow-up greater than 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>) and three had unclear descriptions of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 2004-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2005</LINK>). Losses to follow-up can threaten the validity of the trial since the event rate may be very different in those lost to follow-up versus those who completed the trial and failure to conceal the participants' treatment allocation could also bias the treatment effect in either direction. Secondly, access to aggregate data only within the published studies resulting in pooling of proportions and limiting our ability to adjust for differences in patient populations. Thirdly, the fact that the included trials within our review were conducted predominately in Europe has implications on the applicability of the results in North American.</P>
<P>This review will be updated every two years (or earlier) depending on the emergence of new evidence. Review updates will entail repeating, at periodic intervals, the steps involved in the original review. If new evidence addresses important variables that were not included in the original review we will consider including them. In such instances, we will recheck whether any of their earlier identified studies had such information that was overlooked. Furthermore, should we decide to include a new analysis strategy in our updated review we understand that any new analysis strategies represents a substantive change to the review requiring editorial critique through the Cochrane Collaboration's established editorial process. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is silver level evidence to support the usefulness of strontium ranelate in reducing fractures in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and increasing BMD in women with/without osteoporosis. Pooled estimates using 2 g of strontium ranelate daily compared to placebo in osteoporotic women over a three year period are consistent with a reduction in vertebral fractures (37%); however, there is less of a reduction in non-vertebral fractures (14%) and the effect on hip fractures remains unclear. Strontium ranelate increased BMD at all sites in both treatment and prevention populations and while lower doses of strontium ranelate were superior to placebo, the highest dose demonstrated the greatest increase. There is some evidence to suggest that 2 g of strontium ranelate daily compared to placebo may have a beneficial effect on health related quality of life in postmenopausal women after three years of treatment. Diarrhea may occur, however, adverse events leading to study withdrawal were not significantly increased in the strontium ranelate group. Potential risks to the vascular and neurological system associated with taking 2 g of strontium ranelate daily need to be further explored and quantified. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further monitoring of the quality, effectiveness and safety of strontium ranelate is essential especially in the prevention of osteoporosis. Additional research is required to confirm its mechanism of action. Long term fracture data are needed to confirm the effect that strontium ranelate has on bone health in both prevention and treatment populations. Long term safety data is required with particular attention to be paid to continued fracture efficacy, neurological and vascular system disorders, specifically venous and pulmonary thromboembolism, bone mineralization and skeletal muscle integrity. Future trials to evaluate the impact of strontium ranelate treatment on BMD, including the effect on the elimination of bone strontium in patients switching to other anti-resorptive treatments, are needed. In addition, comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of strontium ranelate relative to other osteoporosis therapies such as bisphosphonates and intermittent recombinant human parathyroid hormone are required.</P>

<P>Feedback: September, 17 2007</P>
<P>Dear Sir/Madam</P>
<P>A key principle of the Cochrane Collaboration is minimising bias through a variety of approaches such as scientific rigour and avoiding conflicts of interest. Existing conflicts of interest must be disclosed (1). The review on strontium ranelate for preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (2) appears to violate these standards. </P>
<P>One of the trials included in the review, the TROPOS trial, was a pivotal trial submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) within the application for marketing authorisation, which was granted in September 2004. According to the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), this trial was negative for the primary endpoint, the incidence of osteoporosis-related peripheral fractures after three years. As stated in the EPAR, the primary efficacy analysis used the Kaplan Meier method and an unadjusted Cox model, yielding a relative risk of 0,85, with the upper boundary of the 95% CI at 1,01 (3). </P>
<P>In 2005, the TROPOS trial was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism. In contrast to the approach described in the EPAR, the authors state, that they carried out simultaneous adjustments for covariates such as age or body mass index. By this means, they achieved a relative risk of 0,84 and an upper boundary of the 95% CI marginally below 1 (0,995) for the primary endpoint. The fact, that the primary efficacy analysis of the TROPOS trial used an unadjusted Cox model and displayed no significant benefit of strontium ranelate, and that, hence, adjustments for age, BMI etc., were at best part of secondary analyses of the primary endpoint, are not mentioned in the journal article (4). Moreover, the review withholds information about the negative result of the primary efficacy analysis of the TROPOS trial as well (2). </P>
<P>Of course, the difference between the result provided in the EPAR and that given in the journal article is marginal and may be clinically meaningless. However, it may be highly relevant for the manufacturer of strontium ranelate, whom the word "significance" may help marketing his product. </P>
<P>Furthermore, the evidence supporting the potential benefits of strontium ranelate is based on poor-quality trials: concealment of allocation is not adequately described in three of four trials, losses to follow-up are greater than 20% in three of four trials. How to interprete the TROPOS trial, in which the final outcome is not known in more than one third of patients (1.771), in view of a difference in the fracture rate between groups of only 1,9% or 43 women? A slight imbalance in fractures in those lost to follow up favouring the placebo group would render the results inconclusive. Thus, the TROPOS trial does not provide reliable evidence of a clinical benefit of strontium ranelate. We are not able to relate to the positive assessments of the review, which appear to be unaffected by the significant shortcomings of the trials. Especially in the abstract, readers are simply told about "silver level evidence" to support the efficacy of strontium ranelate. Will anyone expect the flawed data hidden behind this precious metal label? </P>
<P>On the other hand, potentially life threatening adverse effects of strontium ranelate are played down in the review. The absolute increase of disorders of the vascular system including venous thromboembolism is 1,9%. Thus it is as large as the potential decrease of peripheral fractures in patients treated with strontium ranelate in the TROPOS trial. Notwithstanding the increased risk in vascular and neurological disorders (including seizures) is described as "slight" (2). The potential risk of osteomalacia, seen in animals (3) and associated with strontium overload in hemodialysis patients (5), is perhaps implied in the list of requirements for research ("particular attention to be paid on bone mineralization"), but not openly discussed.</P>
<P>No conflicts of interests are disclosed, even though J.Y. Reginster has received consulting fees of a variety of pharmaceutical companies, among them Servier, the manufacturer of strontium ranelate (6,7).</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Feedback Comment:<BR/>A key principle of the Cochrane Collaboration is minimising bias through a variety of approaches such as scientific rigour and avoiding conflicts of interest. Existing conflicts of interest must be disclosed (1). The review on strontium ranelate for preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (2) appears to violate these standards.</P>
<P>Response:<BR/>We agree that all potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed to minimize bias. This missing information in the original review was an oversight on our part. Therefore, we have updated our systematic review to include the following information: <BR/>All four included trials were supported by Servier, the manufacturer of strontium ranelate. <BR/>Also, J Y Reginster is an author on the four included trials within this review; in addition Dr. Reginster's disclosure of interest is as follows:<BR/>Consulting fees or paid advisory boards: Servier, Novartis, Negma, Lilly, Wyeth, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, Merckle, Nycomed, NPS, Theramex, UCB.</P>
<P>Lecture fees when speaking at the invitation of a commercial sponsor: Merck Sharp and Dohme, Lilly, Rottapharm, IBSA, Genevrier, Novartis, Servier, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Teijin, Teva, Ebewee Pharma, Zodiac, Analis, Theramex, Nycomed, Novo-Nordisk.</P>
<P>Grant Support from Industry: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Rottapharm, Teva, Lilly, Novartis, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen, Servier.</P>
<P>Lastly, J Adachi has also received speaker fees from Servier.</P>

<P>Response:<BR/>In TROPOS, the primary efficacy outcome was the incidence over time of patients with a non-vertebral fracture which was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox model to estimate the RR (95% CI) of non-vertebral fractures with strontium ranelate versus the placebo group (4). However, as the reviewer has pointed out, the adjusted results, which showed a marginally beneficial effect of strontium ranelate (RR 0.84, 0.702 to 0.995) were published in the primary study (4), whereas the unadjusted results included in the EMEA demonstrated no significant benefit (RR 0.85, 0.71 to 1.01) (3) were not. Therefore, to ensure the reader is aware of the difference between the unadjusted and adjusted non-vertebral fracture results from the TROPOS trial, we have included both sets of results, in addition to the potential impact from a clinical perspective, within the discussion section of our review. </P>
<P>Having access to aggregate data only, the weighted relative risk for non-vertebral fractures was determined using the number of individuals with at least one incident non-vertebral fracture from the individual clinical trials (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.702 to 0.995) (4;6). We did not have access to individual patient data. </P>
<P>
<BR/>Feedback Comment:<BR/>Furthermore, the evidence supporting the potential benefits of strontium ranelate is based on poor-quality trials: concealment of allocation is not adequately described in three of four trials, losses to follow-up are greater than 20% in three of four trials. How to interprete the TROPOS trial, in which the final outcome is not known in more than one third of patients (1.771), in view of a difference in the fracture rate between groups of only 1,9% or 43 women? A slight imbalance in fractures in those lost to follow up favouring the placebo group would render the results inconclusive. Thus, the TROPOS trial does not provide reliable evidence of a clinical benefit of strontium ranelate. We are not able to relate to the positive assessments of the review, which appear to be unaffected by the significant shortcomings of the trials. Especially in the abstract, readers are simply told about "silver level evidence" to support the efficacy of strontium ranelate. Will anyone expect the flawed data hidden behind this precious metal label?</P>
<P>Response:<BR/>As recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group, we assessed study validity using the Jadad instrument and graded the evidence for each outcome with the ribbon grading system. Both the Jadad instrument and ribbon grading system are described and referenced within the body of our review to ensure that the related results have context. Furthermore, the results related to these assessments are clearly detailed in the results section. The implications of the limitations (including losses to follow-up) are openly summarized within the discussion section. We also revised the abstract to ensure the reader takes into account the specific limitations related to the quality of the included studies, when interpreting the results of our review.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Feedback Comment:<BR/>On the other hand, potentially life threatening adverse effects of strontium ranelate are played down in the review. The absolute increase of disorders of the vascular system including venous thromboembolism is 1,9%. Thus it is as large as the potential decrease of peripheral fractures in patients treated with strontium ranelate in the TROPOS trial. Notwithstanding the increased risk in vascular and neurological disorders (including seizures) is described as "slight" (2). The potential risk of osteomalacia, seen in animals (3) and associated with strontium overload in hemodialysis patients (5), is perhaps implied in the list of requirements for research ("particular attention to be paid on bone mineralization"), but not openly discussed.</P>
<P>Response: <BR/>We removed the descriptor "slightly" from sentences within the abstract and the discussion section that reported on the increased risk in vascular and neurological side-effects with taking 2 g of strontium ranelate daily over a 3 to 4 year period. The actual risk data is stated within the discussion section and Table 3 "Other adverse events from additional sources (EMEA 2004* and Servier**)".</P>
<P>The discussion section has been revised to include the potential risk of strontium induced osteomalacia observed in animal studies and associated with increased strontium bone concentrations in dialysis patients (see paragraph seven of the discussion).</P>
<P>It is worth mentioning that since the publication of our review, an updated safety assessment based on the final year study reports from the two five-year clinical trials (SOTI and TROPOS) was submitted. Results showed that the profile of the adverse drug reactions were consistent with the information initially presented in the Summary of Product Characteristics, although the frequencies of the specified adverse events required updating. In addition, following the assessment of the 3rd Periodic Safety Update Report from September 2005 to March 2006, the following effects (&lt;1/10,000 patients) were added to the product information: vomiting, abdominal pain, oral mucosal irritation including stomatitis and/or mouth ulceration, hypersensitivity reactions including rash, angioedema (3). An analysis of transiliac bone biopsies with histomorphometry taken from women receiving strontium ranelate for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis after 1-5 years of 2 g/day provided evidence of bone safety with preservation of primary mineralization (8).</P>
<P>Feedback comment:<BR/>No conflicts of interests are disclosed, even though J.Y. Reginster has received consulting fees of a variety of pharmaceutical companies, among them Servier, the manufacturer of strontium ranelate (6,7).</P>
<P>Response:<BR/>This concern has been addressed (please see response to the reviewer's first comment).</P>

<P>Feedback: One of the authors of the review is JY Reginster, who is also an author of each of the four trials included in the review. It is not stated whether these trials were funded by Servier, the manufacturer of strontium ranelate, but that seems likely. Has JY Reginster worked closely with Servier? Has he had any contractual arrangement with Servier? If a review author is an author of one or more trials in a review, that also must be acknowledged as a potential conflict of interest. Yet under 'Conflicts of interest' it is stated "None known".<BR/>These points need explicit consideration and open discussion by the editors of the MSG. It seems that for the present the review should be treated with some reserve.</P>
<P>Submitter agrees with default conflict of interest statement:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>
