<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:58:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression. Fluvoxamine is one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, there is evidence of differing side-effect profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including these differences in side effect profiles.</P>

<P>Fluvoxamine, one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. Several studies have previously reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the treatment of major depression. However, these reviews are now outdated.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:56:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and side effect profile of fluvoxamine for major depression in comparison with other anti-depressive agents, including tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs, SNRIs, other newer agents and other conventional psychotropic drugs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-02-18 14:15:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register. Trial databases and ongoing trial registers in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, were handsearched for randomised controlled trials. We checked reference lists of the articles included in the review, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of affective disorder for published reports and citations of unpublished research. The date of last search was 31 August 2008.</P>

<P>Two independent review authors inspected citations and abstracts, obtained papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

<P>A total of 54 randomised controlled trials (n = 5122) were included. No strong evidence was found to indicate that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to other antidepressants regarding response, remission and tolerability. However, differing side effect profiles were evident, especially with regard to gastrointestinal side effects of fluvoxamine when compared to other antidepressants. For example, fluvoxamine was generally associated with a higher incidence of vomiting/nausea (versus imipramine, OR 2.23, CI 1.59 to 3.14; versus clomipramine, OR 2.13, CI 1.06 to 4.27; versus amitriptyline, OR 2.86, CI 1.31 to 2.63).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:59:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-11 23:26:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression is generally diagnosed when a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure are usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt, and morbid thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). In 2002, major depression was the third leading health burden in the world, following only lower respiratory infections and HIV/AIDS, and accounting for 4.5% of total human suffering related to health concerns. Moreover, the incidence of depression is expected to rise during the next 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). The depressed condition is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, coupled with a loss of functioning and productivity, which creates significant demands on health service provider workloads (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). In the USA, <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2003</LINK> estimated the economic burden of depression to be just over $83 billion in 2000. Of this total, $26 billion came from direct treatment costs, $5 billion came from suicide-related costs, and $52 billion came from workplace costs. These figures were also suspected to underestimate the true economic burden of the disease, as they did not take into account factors such as the burden on family members and caregivers, the cost of lost productivity while at work, and costs associated with those who remain untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-10 23:53:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>Fluvoxamine ((<I>E</I>)-5-methoxy-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pentan-1-one <I>O</I>-2-aminoethyl oxime) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available as an antidepressant since 1983 in many countries &#8211; 87 countries and regions as of 2006, including some European countries and Japan. It is also available in many countries for anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. Fluvoxamine is structurally different from the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, and other classes of antidepressants, and also differs chemically from various other SSRIs. For example, fluvoxamine is the only monocyclic SSRI and it belongs to the 2-aminoethyloximethers of aralkylketones (<LINK REF="REF-Claassen-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claassen 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1987</LINK>). Therefore, some differential clinical potency may be expected, not only between the drugs classes but also among the SSRIs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 01:11:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluvoxamine is well absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Plasma protein binding of fluvoxamine is low (77%), compared with other SSRIs. Fluvoxamine displays nonlinear, steady-state pharmacokinetics throughout the therapeutic range, with disproportionately higher plasma concentrations at higher doses (<LINK REF="REF-Perucca-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perucca 1994</LINK>). However, plasma fluvoxamine concentrations show no clear relationship with patient responses to the antidepressant or to the severity of adverse effects. Fluvoxamine pharmacokinetics remains unaltered by increasing age or by renal impairment. Fluvoxamine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. It has a prominent affinity for the CYP1A2 isozyme, a lesser affinity for the CYP3A4 and CYP2C isozymes, and a minimal affinity for CYP2D6. Fluvoxamine impairs metabolic elimination of a number of drugs, including TCAs (tertiary, but not secondary, amines), alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam, theophylline, propranolol and, possibly, carbamazepine. It generates no active metabolites. Smoking is known to increase CYP1A2 activity, and smokers appear to have lower serum concentration of fluvoxamine compared with non-smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Spigset-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spigset 1995</LINK>). The drug is eliminated with a mean half-life of 15 hours, with a range from nine to 28 hours. Excretion is primarily in the urine, predominantly as metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-van-Harten-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Harten 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:59:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Many different AD agents are available, including TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs: venlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran), and other newer agents (mirtazapine, reboxetine, bupropion). In many Western countries, AD consumption has risen dramatically over the last 20 years, mainly because of the increasing consumption of SSRIs and newer ADs, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2005</LINK>). SSRIs are generally better tolerated than TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2000</LINK>), and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparisons have provided contrasting findings. Amitriptyline, for example, may have an edge over SSRIs in terms of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2007</LINK>), while individual SSRIs and SNRIs may differ in terms of efficacy and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puech-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puech 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>; ).</P>
<P>Two systematic reviews on fluvoxamine exist in current literature. Burton (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1991</LINK>) reviewed 17 double-blind comparative studies between fluvoxamine and other ADs in depressed patients. Ware (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1997</LINK>) reviewed 31 controlled trials of fluvoxamine in the pharmacotherapy of depression. These reviews are now quite outdated and neither has provided meta-analytic summaries.</P>
<P>A group of researchers therefore agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants Study Group (MANGA Study Group), in order to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer antidepressant. As of February 2010, we have completed an individual review for fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2006</LINK>), mirtazapine (<LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2008</LINK>), milnacipran (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2007</LINK>), escitalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>) and sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009b</LINK>) and have published the protocols for citalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Imperadore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperadore 2007</LINK>), duloxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Nose-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nose 2007</LINK>), paroxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007b</LINK>) , venlafaxine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007c</LINK>) and reboxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2009</LINK>). The multiple-treatment meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants has also been published (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the present review, we report head-to-head comparisons not only between fluvoxamine and the other 11 new-generation antidepressants, but also between fluvoxamine and older antidepressants, providing detailed accounts of their comparative side effect profiles.</P>

<P>We included the following subtypes of depression: chronic, with catatonic features, with melancholic features, with atypical features, with postpartum onset, and with seasonal pattern. We also included studies in which up to 20% patients presented depressive episodes in bipolar affective disorder. When depressive patients in the trial had psychotic features, we included those studies in which up to 20% patients presented psychotic features. A concurrent secondary diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered an exclusion criterion. A concurrent primary diagnosis of Axis I or II disorders was an exclusion criterion.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g., pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, even despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on the strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: dropouts were included in this analysis. Where participants have been excluded from the trial before the endpoint, we have assumed that they experienced a negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g., failure to respond to treatment). We examined the validity of this decision in the sensitivity analyses by applying worst- and best-case scenarios. If a statistically significant difference was found, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated from an odds ratio obtained by a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We applied the loose ITT analyses for continuous variables, whereby all the patients with at least one post-baseline measurement were represented by their last observations carried forward (LOCF), with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced.</P>
<P>When dichotomous outcomes were not reported but baseline mean, endpoint mean and those standard deviation (SD) of the HRSD (or other depression scale) were provided, we converted continuous outcome data expressed as mean and SD into the number of responding and remitted patients, according to the validated imputation method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>). We examined the validity of this imputation in the sensitivity analyses. Where SDs were not reported, authors were asked to supply the data. When only the standard error (SE) or t-statistics or P values are reported, SDs were calculated according to Altman (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>).

The robustness of this summary measure was routinely examined by checking the fixed-effect model OR and the random effects model risk ratios (RRs). Material differences between the models were reported. A p value of less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were considered statistically significant.</P>
<P>Fixed-effect analyses were performed routinely for the continuous outcomes as well, to investigate the effect of the choice of method on the estimates.

We examined a "wish bias" by comparing the trials where fluvoxamine was used as an investigational drug, the drug that was used as a new compound, to the trials where fluvoxamine was used as a comparator, since some evidence suggests that a new antidepressant might perform worse when used as a comparator than when used as an investigational agent (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. We excluded trials funded by, or with at least one author affiliated with, a pharmaceutical company marketing fluvoxamine. This sensitivity analysis is particularly important in light of the recent repeated findings that funding strongly affects outcomes of research studies (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Procyshyn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Procyshyn 2004</LINK>) and because industry sponsorship and authorship of clinical trials have increased over the past 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Buchkowsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchkowsky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>8. We excluded studies that included patients with bipolar depression.</P>
<P>9. We excluded trials studies that included patients with psychotic features.</P>
<P>Our routine application of random effects and fixed-effect models, as well as our secondary outcomes of remission rates and continuous severity measures, may be considered additional forms of sensitivity analyses.</P>

In addition, 18 studies used diagnostic criteria such as "major depressive episode" (DSM-III or IV) , "major affective disorder" (DSM-III), "depression" (Feighner criteria), or "unipolar or bipolar disorder" (Feighner criteria), and did not exclude patients with bipolar depression.

In 25 studies, some elderly subjects (over 65 years old) were included, but the actual number of elderly people was not reported in most trials. One trial was for elderly patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Bocksberger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bocksberger 1993</LINK>), while seven studies did not include any elderly patients. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1996</LINK>) only included patients with severe depression, defined by a score higher than 25 on the HRSD-17 at baseline.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>There were 30 studies comparing fluvoxamine with TCAs, five studies including heterocyclics, 10 including SSRIs, three including SNRIs, four including newer antidepressants, and one comparing fluvoxamine with sulpiride and one four-arm study comparing fluvoxamine with amitriptyline, doxepine and paroxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Rechlin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rechlin 1994</LINK>). We could not find studies comparing fluvoxamine with non-conventional anti-depressive agents such as herbal products. Regarding fluvoxamine dosing, the trials included five fixed and 43 flexible schedules, and one study did not state dosing schedule. Standard doses were used in 22 studies, and high doses in 28 studies. Four studies did not state fluvoxamine dosing.</P>

We were unable to obtain further data because we could not contact the authors by any means, nor could we obtain extra information from these authors. The majority of the identified studies (44 studies) used the HRSD as a primary or secondary outcome measure, while a minority of studies used the MADRS and Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI).</P>
<P>Among the 50 studies reporting dropouts due to any reason, 42 reported dropouts due to side effects. Forty-one studies reported the number of patients experiencing individual side effects. It was unclear how these adverse effects were measured in terms of either severity or duration.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-13 00:04:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>The main results of our study revealed no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either inferior or superior to other antidepressants, including TCAs such as amitriptyline or clomipramine, other SSRIs or other forms, in terms of either response or remission in any clinical setting, even though a small number of findings suggested a direction of effect in favour of fluvoxamine (versus desipramine) or in favour of control drug (venlafaxine) in terms of response and remission at acute phase. This was somewhat surprising because TCAs are sometimes believed to be more effective than SSRIs, particularly among hospitalized depressive patients (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were also unable to find differences in dropouts for any reason, including side effects, between fluvoxamine and other antidepressive agents. Although the 95% CI are wide and we cannot exclude possibilities of meaningful differences between fluvoxamine and other antidepressive agents, our findings at least suggest a need for moderation of the general statement that holds that patients tolerate SSRIs better than TCAs. In addition, we included 10 trials involving fluvoxamine in our review, and from the pooled data, we were unable to find any differences in total dropouts or dropouts due to side effects between fluvoxamine and other SSRIs.</P>
<P>The analysis of individual side effects points to evidence of differing side effects profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and TCAs. Diarrhoea and weight loss were experienced significantly more frequently with fluvoxamine than with TCAs. Vomiting/nausea and weight loss/anorexia were also experienced significantly more frequently with fluvoxamine than with TCAs and some other antidepressive agents (e.g., mianserin, milnacipran and some newer antidepressants). However, constipation and decreased salivation/dry mouth were more common with TCAs than with fluvoxamine.</P>
<P>Not only are SSRIs chemically different from TCAs, heterocyclics and other antidepressive agents, but considerable structural differences also exist even among the various SSRIs. Therefore, some differential pharmacology between the drugs in the same class may be expected. However, head-to-head comparisons found no evidence to suggest side effect profile differences between fluvoxamine and other SSRIs, except for sweating, which was more common in recipients of paroxetine than fluvoxamine in a single trial.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-02-12 00:36:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has a number of limitations in overall completeness and applicability.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Severity of depression was believed to be associated with good treatment response in patients taking TCAs compared with those taking SSRIs (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1994</LINK>), However, all of the studies included in this review, other than that of <LINK REF="STD-Claghorn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Claghorn 1996</LINK>, were conducted for moderate/mild depression. For this reason, the findings from this review may not be representative of more severely affected patients.</P>
<P>In addition, the findings from this review may not be representative for the depressive elderly, since only one trial was found in which recruitment was wholly conducted for the depressive elderly (<LINK REF="STD-Bocksberger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bocksberger 1993</LINK>). Elder patients with depression are recognized as being more vulnerable to adverse effects of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1995</LINK>). If fluvoxamine is more or less acceptable than other antidepressants, this advantage/disadvantage might be obvious in trials focused on geriatric depression.</P>
<P>Twenty-five out of 54 trials explicitly included or might have included patients with major depressive episodes caused by bipolar disorder. However, we found no heterogeneity in the pooled results.</P>
<P>In many countries, including the UK, many patients with depression are treated solely in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Spijker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spijker 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1991</LINK>), and depressive disorder in primary care has a different profile than treated in secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-Suh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suh 1997</LINK>). However, we could find only two articles conducted in primary care settings (<LINK REF="STD-Barge_x002d_Schaapveld-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barge-Schaapveld 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1991</LINK>), and the relevance of the studies included in this review to primary care settings should be limited.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Considering the often chronic and recurrence-prone presentation of major depression, long-term or follow-up interventions are often required for optimal treatment of this disorder. However, we could find no studies that examined the long-term efficacy of fluvoxamine for major depression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Treatments for major depression should be assessed not only by psychiatric symptoms, but also by general functioning and/or QOL. However, no trials included in this review incorporated those outcomes. Considering that major depression is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, the under-investigation of these outcomes borders on negligence. In addition, no studies included cost to health care services as an outcome. The choice of antidepressants may be influenced by factors such as safety of the medication in overdose and the propensity of the medication to be associated with withdrawal symptoms. However, we found no randomised trials that examined these factors in this review.</P>

<P>Fifty-four trials with 4353 patients were included in this analysis; 2117 were randomised to fluvoxamine and 2236 to comparator drugs. These included trials had a number of methodological shortcomings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>All of the trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-Rossini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rossini 2005</LINK>) failed to describe methods of random sequence generation. In addition, no trials reported the method of allocation concealment. Therefore, it is conceivable that selection bias might have occurred in the trials included in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Information on blinding was sought for many trials; however, no test of blinding success was conducted in any study. The use of an independent, blind assessor was explicitly described in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otsubo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Otsubo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossini-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rossini 2005</LINK>). On the whole, little information was presented on the outcome assessment process, and the extent to which detection bias might have occurred was uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>Forty-four out of the 54 included studies used the HRSD as a primary or secondary outcome measure, while a minority of studies used the MADRS and CGI. It is conceivable that the study authors did not report some outcomes in which results failed to show statistical significance. Therefore, the results of our meta-analyses could overestimate the intervention effect due to outcome reporting bias. In addition, only a few studies reported SDs for a change and endpoint score of any depression scale that we adopted as a secondary outcome, which meant that we had to borrow SDs from other trials that did report SDs for the outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High discontinuation rate</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-seven of the 54 studies had dropout rates higher than 20%. This high attrition rate could have influenced treatment outcomes; for two studies with high attrition rate (<LINK REF="STD-Mullin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mullin 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 1991</LINK>), sensitivity analysis performing the worst case scenario revealed the statistically significant results in favour of the comparator and the best case scenario in favour of fluvoxamine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>If we assumed that response rate for experimental antidepressants was 50% and that of the control was 35%, 183 participants would be needed in each treatment group to detect this type of difference at 80% power and 95% confidence. However, most trials included in this review were small; the majority of the studies (38 RCTs) recruited less than 100 participants in total. This made it difficult to interpret the negative finding. In addition, most trials did not discuss their low power or did not conduct sample size calculation</P>

As a result, randomised evidence from unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-Schoemaker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schoemaker 2002</LINK>) as well as published studies was included in the review. Furthermore, our strong efforts made to obtain missing data resulted in additional data from investigators from 15 trials.</P>
<P>We also imputed response and remission outcomes by applying a threshold of the standard depression severity scales, such as the HRSD or MADRS, with a validated statistical method if they were not available in original trials (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). We believe our methodology can be used in future systematic reviews in order to minimise outcome reporting bias and to make the most use of information from the obtained trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review is not without methodological problems.</P>
<P>First of all, although neither the funnel plot nor Egger's test detected small-study effects, we still cannot rule out the risk of publication bias. There were only 16 studies included in the funnel plots, and all studies were of similar size; therefore, it was difficult to find a meaningful result from funnel plots and their statistical tests. In addition, we have concerns about those five studies that only reported biochemical or physiological outcomes, instead of reporting clinical efficacy and/or tolerability outcomes. For example, one RCT reported prolactin responses to d-fenfluramine for depressive patients, before and after medication but included no clinical outcome at all (<LINK REF="STD-Kavoussi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kavoussi 1999</LINK>). This trial formed part of an industry drug trial sponsored by Solvay, the primary fluvoxamine marketer. We were unable to locate a trial matching the description in this report, and we strongly suspect that we are missing a large trial sponsored by this company. We excluded a crossover trial that did not report the result of first randomisation period (<LINK REF="STD-Emrich-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Emrich 1987</LINK>) and a trial that only reported the result of a maintenance period (<LINK REF="STD-White-1990" TYPE="STUDY">White 1990</LINK>). We tried to contact the original authors to obtain missing outcomes but our attempts were in vain. We believe that publication bias remained a very real risk in this review.</P>
<P>Second, pharmaceutical companies marketing fluvoxamine sponsored a large majority of the trials comparing fluvoxamine with TCAs; the majority of the authors of these trials set fluvoxamine as an investigational drug. Therefore, comparability between fluvoxamine and TCAs in efficacy and tolerability may not be unconditionally warranted; that is to say, the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine over TCAs might be overestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Third, although sensitivity analyses excluding trials for which the response rates had to be calculated based on the imputation method did not find any evidence that it changed the results of the main analyses, this could have happened for many reasons other than validity of the imputation methods. For example, there were few studies included in each analysis and most studies were small-sized trials that reported null effects; therefore, removing some trials is unlikely to have a large effect.</P>
<P>Finally, very few of the trials employed standardized instruments in the reporting of side effects. Many of the side effects experienced by patients taking antidepressants may be confused with symptoms and signs of depression. Many trials reported the number of patients who experienced unwanted symptoms during trials, but some articles defined side effects strictly as experiences that appeared for the first time during the treatment period, or experiences that appeared between screen and baseline, but increased in severity during the treatment period. Some trials did not report a side effect profile at all. Obviously the emphasis on detecting side effects differs between trials, and this may explain some of the observed differences.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-12 16:11:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK> conducted a well-designed systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs, involving direct comparisons between five SSRIs in the treatment of major depressive illness. The review reported that significantly more patients on fluvoxamine stopped treatment due to any reason and due to side effects compared with other SSRIs. However, this review included only five trials involving fluvoxamine, and these are outdated. The clinical guidelines released by the same authors (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2001</LINK>) suggested that fluvoxamine was not the best SSRI choice in routine practice because of its relatively high discontinuation rate, but the results of our review do not provide any evidence that support or argue against this statement. </P>
<P>We have recently published a multiple-treatment meta-analysis (MTM) in which our data for fluvoxamine were merged with those for 11 other new generation antidepressants and both direct and indirect comparisons among them were statistically pooled (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>). The MTM offers a clinically meaningful synthesis when several competing treatments are available for one disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salanti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salanti 2008</LINK>), as is the case with major depression, while examining the overall strength and consistency of this network of evidence. The corresponding ORs and their 95%CI for response and total dropout are tabulated in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>We note that:<BR/>1) all of the confidence intervals overlap widely between direct comparisons and MTM (direct + indirect) comparisons, mainly because the 95%CI for direct comparisons are wide, generally indicating that the network of evidence is consistent.<BR/>2) When nominal superiority of fluvoxamine existed in direct comparisons (fluvoxamine over sertraline for response, and fluvoxamine over mirtazapine for dropout), this was lost in the MTM, although again their 95%CI overlapped widely.<BR/>3) When the ratio of ORs was greater than 1.5 or smaller than 0.67 (versus sertraline, versus milnacipran and versus venlafaxine for response, and versus venlafaxine for dropout), the MTM results were almost always less extreme (i.e., closer to 1.0) than the direct comparisons, very probably because of cancelling out possible sponsorship, publication and other biases.</P>
<P>The relative merits and demerits of direct versus MTM comparisons are still debatable (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2006</LINK>) and we need to carefully weigh and synthesize the direct with the indirect comparisons.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-12 16:12:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>The main finding of the present study is that the present review is based on poor quality evidence of primary studies and we found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior of inferior to any other antidepressants, including TCAs and SSRIs, in terms of efficacy and tolerability during the treatment of depression in the acute phase. On the other hand, evidence is clear for differing side effect profiles, especially in terms of gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and TCAs. The results of the study led us to conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations, including these differences in side effect profiles.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-11 02:31:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ichiro M Omori">
<P>We could have learnt more about the effects of fluvoxamine if the studies included in the review had clearly described sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and reasons for dropout. In addition to assessment of depressive symptoms and levels of general functioning, QOL and patient satisfaction would be most informative. If continuous rating scales are to be employed, a concerted effort should be made to come up with an agreement as to which measures are the most useful. For analyses of side effect profiles, more reliable and consistent methods of monitoring and reporting side effects during the trial are needed.</P>
