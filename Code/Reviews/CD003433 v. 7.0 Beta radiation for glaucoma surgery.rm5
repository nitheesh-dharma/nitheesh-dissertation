<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-09 16:21:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The aim of glaucoma surgery is to lower the pressure in the eye. The outcome of glaucoma surgery can be affected by the rate at which the surgical wound heals. Beta radiation has been proposed as a rapid and simple treatment to slow down the healing response. It is applied during the operation using a radioactive applicator which emits beta rays which have only a very local penetration to a depth of less than one millimetre. The intensity of the emission from the applicator (usually Strontium-90) determines the duration it is applied to the surgical site in order to deliver the required dose of radiation which effectively prevents scar tissue formation.</P>
<P>We found four trials that randomised 551 people to trabeculectomy with beta irradiation versus trabeculectomy alone. People who had trabeculectomy with beta irradiation were less likely to have an eye pressure that was too high one year after surgery compared to people who had trabeculectomy alone. However, people who had beta irradiation had an increased risk of cataract after surgery.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-10 14:09:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 14:29:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Beta radiation inhibits wound healing, and has been shown to improve survival of glaucoma filtration surgery in vitro and in vivo (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1991</LINK>). Beta radiation causes growth-arrest, primarily due to its effects on P450 (a controller of cell cycling), rather than producing destruction of cells (<LINK REF="REF-Constable-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constable 1999</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 16:47:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The term glaucoma defines a group of conditions in which there is characteristic optic neuropathy associated with progressive visual field loss (loss of peripheral and then central vision). Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is recognised to be one of the principal risk factors for glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Buhrmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhrmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollows-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollows 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 1995</LINK>). Glaucoma is the commonest cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with at least 70 million people affected and over seven million blind from the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 1996</LINK>). With an ageing world population, the prevalence is likely to increase considerably in the coming years.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 14:29:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Lowering IOP has long been established as a means of treating glaucoma, despite a lack of good data for its effectiveness in preventing visual field loss (<LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vass 2007</LINK>). What information we do have suggests that surgery is currently the most effective means of lowering IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Migdal-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migdal 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lichter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichter 2001</LINK>). Trabeculectomy is the most widely used surgical procedure for glaucoma. In the developed world, surgery is used where other modalities (medical or laser therapy or both) are not sufficiently effective. In poorer countries trabeculectomy may be used as a primary treatment for glaucoma.</P>
<P>The aim of the trabeculectomy operation is to create a fistula (channel) between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space to allow controlled release of fluid from the eye. A partial-thickness scleral flap is fashioned at the limbus, with a sclerostomy created under this flap forming a so-called guarded fistula. Fluid from the anterior chamber drains out of the eye through this fistula to the subconjunctival space forming a conjunctival bleb. Fluid in this bleb is thought to be carried away by vessels within the conjunctiva and also by passing through the conjunctival wall. Final IOP may be determined by the size of the bleb, downstream drainage from the conjunctival vessels and the healing response of the eye. The most common cause for failure of trabeculectomy is subconjunctival fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Hitchings-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hitchings 1983</LINK>) resulting in occlusion of the fistula with loss of IOP lowering effect.</P>
<P>In elderly white people with glaucoma who have not had prior eye surgery, the success rate of surgery is considered to be in the region of 80%. However, the success rate is lower in certain groups including black people, people with ocular inflammation or neovascularisation, those who have had previous ocular surgery and children (<LINK REF="REF-Ritch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritch 1996</LINK>). It is also apparent that prior topical medical treatment may prejudice the overall success of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Broadway-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadway 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavin 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various agents have been used to reduce the excessive healing that leads to failure of trabeculectomy. The most widely used agents are Mitomycin C and 5-Fluorouracil. Mitomycin C was introduced in 1983 although widespread use did not occur until the mid 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1983</LINK>). 5-Fluorouracil was introduced in 1984, after positive reports from a randomised controlled trial (RCT), and was used widely until use of Mitomycin C became widespread (<LINK REF="REF-FFSG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FFSG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heuer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>). Systematic reviews of postoperative 5-Fluorouracil (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2001</LINK>) and of intraoperative Mitomycin C (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2005</LINK>) are already published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Although both of these antimetabolites have proven effective clinically they are associated with complications. Both Mitomycin C and 5-Fluorouracil are used in liquid form, delivered by placing microsurgical sponges soaked in the drug directly onto the operative site. Because the antimetabolites are liquids they carry the risk of leakage away from the treatment site. This leakage can lead to extraocular or, more seriously, intraocular toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Franks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, the variability of the delivery of the drug between the impregnated sponge and the subconjunctival tissues means that accurate dosimetry has proven difficult. Both treatments have been associated with the development of thin, avascular filtration blebs, and these are in turn associated with an increased risk of sight threatening complications including hypotony (a very soft eye) and endophthalmitis (ocular infection) (<LINK REF="REF-Wolner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaldo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaldo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zacharia-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharia 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One alternative to the use of antimetabolites is beta radiation. Precise control of dose and area of treatment may be easily achieved as it is applied using a Strontium-90 applicator at the completion of surgery. The doses used are typically 750 cGy or 1000 cGy and single application is used without fractionation. Beta radiation was first used for glaucoma surgery in the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Iliff-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iliff 1944</LINK>) and has been used at Moorfields Eye Hospital for many years in the management of paediatric glaucoma. Good results were reported with a non-randomised retrospective study in a cohort of these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1991</LINK>). Beta radiation may be especially suitable for use in developing countries due to the technical simplicity of application and as no running costs are required.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-27 16:46:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Recently, several workers have described the use of beta radiation with trabeculectomy. The overall effectiveness of this mode of therapy is unknown and a systematic review is needed to assess the effects both in people where a high success rate is expected and in those where a lower success rate would be expected.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-27 16:54:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The aims of this review were to assess the effects of beta radiation with trabeculectomy on surgical failure due to postoperative scarring in people with glaucoma. Mean IOP was an additional primary outcome. The review also aimed to gather evidence on whether beta radiation is associated with increased complications after surgery as compared to standard trabeculectomy.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 16:59:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The primary outcome measures for this review were:</P>
<P>1. the proportion of failed trabeculectomies at 12 months or more after surgery (defined as repeat surgery or uncontrolled IOP more than 20 mmHg with or without additional topical or systemic medications);</P>
<P>2. mean IOP at 12 months or more. Intraocular pressure is used as a primary outcome measure for many clinical trials in glaucoma. The ideal outcome measure is visual function, most commonly expressed in terms of visual field (with allowance for visual acuity). However, the difficulty in determining visual field progression due to the inherently high noise in this psychophysical measure means that trials using this outcome measure need to be performed with large sample sizes and long follow-up time. For practical reasons, IOP was used as a surrogate measurement; the degree of IOP reduction appears to be related to the rate of visual field progression (<LINK REF="REF-Gaasterland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaasterland 2000</LINK>).</P>

In the included trials there was some evidence that the control group risk of failure of surgery was different in different ethnic groups (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We therefore did a (posthoc) subgroup analysis by ethnic group.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' for further details.

Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK>) were performed in Caucasian people, with primary open angle glaucoma with an expected high success rate. <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1994</LINK> was found in abstract form, which had been performed in Chinese people with open angle glaucoma. The success rate in this trial was also expected to be high, although not as high as for Caucasian people. One trial was performed in black African patients (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2006</LINK>). Two trials used a dosage of 750 cGy (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK>) and two trials used a dosage of 1000 cGy (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 551 people were randomised in these four trials. Follow-up ranged from 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK>) to four years (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. The trials reported as research papers were of acceptable methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK>). In all three trials, sealed envelopes with a randomised number sequence were used for allocation concealment. Examiners determining outcome were unaware of trial allocation. The study published in abstract form has not been subsequently published but we were able to get some information from the trial investigator who reported adequate allocation concealment. Intention-to-treat analysis was not formally reported in any trial. In all trials, only one eye was entered into the trial.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-05-09 16:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>People who had trabeculectomy with beta irradiation had a lower risk of surgical failure one year after surgery compared to people who had trabeculectomy alone (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> pooled risk ratio 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.40)). The treatment effect appeared to be similar in the different ethnic groups. However the three trials in non African people were smaller and the risk of surgical failure lower in Caucasian people. In the two trials of Caucasian people there were no cases of surgical failure in the treatment group. This analysis, therefore, does not have good power to detect true differences in treatment effect in the different ethnic groups. Only two trials reported mean IOP at the end of the study (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). People receiving beta irradiation had on average 1 mmHg lower IOP 12 months after surgery. However, this result was not statistically significant and the result is compatible with both lower and higher IOP after surgery (pooled mean difference -0.97 95% CI -2.56 to 0.62).</P>
<P>The most recent study conducted on a South African population was the largest with the greatest power to detect a difference. In this study relative risk of failure was 0.21 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.40) at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two trials reporting results in Caucasians both had very high success rates. The study from New Zealand, <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK> showed a small trend for people having beta radiation to have a higher success rate, a lower IOP and a larger drop in IOP. None of these results were significant. The study from Leeds, <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK> had success rates of 95% and 100% in each arm of the trial for the most generous definition of success and high success rates, even for more stringent definitions. There was no significant difference in success rates between the two arms of the trial for any outcome measure. Neither study had sufficient power to compare adverse effect rates.The Hong Kong study, <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1994</LINK> demonstrated a significant difference in success between the two arms of the study. The failure rate was 25% in the control arm and 9% in the treatment arm.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were reported in all studies but numbers were low. There was evidence of an increased risk of cataract requiring surgical intervention in the treatment group (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> pooled risk ratio 2.89 (95% CI 1.39 to 6.00)) . Numbers of other complications were too low to comment on (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), although there was a suggestion that beta radiation augmented trabeculectomy was associated with a small increase in the risk of ocular hypotony (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:00:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Several points are worthy of comment in considering the data. In the <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK> study, four participants had only three months follow-up. We were able to obtain the raw data from the investigators. One of those four participants had failed surgery with an IOP 21mmHg or more at three months. We have counted this patient as a surgical failure at 12 months as well. For the other three patients who had an IOP less than 21mmHg at three months we cannot make any assumptions about their status at 12 months. The dose used for both the <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2000</LINK> studies was 750 cGy, this is less than the dose used in <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1994</LINK> and cell culture and in vivo animal data suggests that the difference may be a biologically significant one. In the Lai study, the numbers were reported as percentages only and no further information was obtained from the study author.<BR/>
</P>
<P>From the limited data available, it appears that beta radiation improves success rates in people with an intermediate surgical prognosis and possibly in those with an already good surgical prognosis. This may be at the cost of an increased rate of cataract development.</P>
<P>The degree of improvement in success is similar to that of other antimetabolites but there is no trial data comparing beta radiation with other metabolites such as Mitomycin C or 5-Fluorouracil.</P>
<P>In a developing world setting, with a high surgical volume, beta radiation has advantages in that there are no ongoing costs and it has a long service life (more than 20 years) although capital outlay is significant (approximately £5000 to purchase a Sr90 emitter in the UK). A further issue is that in the UK and many other countries, a government licence is required to use a radioactive device. Obtaining this may necessitate extra training; this and associated bureaucracy may place a barrier on the use of an emitter. In the UK, storage is in a lead lined repository, usually in the medical physics department. However, this may be excessive given the attenuation of Sr90 in air and storage in an area with a significant physical distance from those in the working environment is considered to be adequate in many settings.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:02:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:01:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Beta radiation-augmented trabeculectomy reduces the risk of surgical failure compared to standard trabeculectomy. It may be clinically useful but it is unknown how it compares in both effectiveness and safety to other, more widely used antimetabolites. Data on adverse effects are limited. A specific role for beta radiation is unclear and this depends on there being more evidence available to guide practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:02:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There are only four trials of beta radiation for increasing the probability of success in trabeculectomy. Much of the existing evidence for controlling wound healing after trabeculectomy concentrates on liquid antimetabolites. How beta radiation compares to liquid antimetabolites is unknown. Beta radiation may be particularly useful in a developing world setting but this has yet to be evaluated. Outcomes of particular interest are the degree of IOP lowering, success rates in the long term, and adverse effects - particularly cataract. Further trials comparing beta radiation with other antimetabolites would be useful in such a setting but may also be of relevance to richer countries.</P>
