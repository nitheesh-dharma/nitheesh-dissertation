<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-05 10:14:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriomata are benign growths of the ovary. Evidence suggests that surgery to remove the endometrioma provides better results than draining and destroying the lining of the cyst with regard to the recurrence of the cyst, pain symptoms and also the chance of a spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Surgery to excise the cyst should be the favoured surgical approach. Evidence that one technique is favoured in women who desire to conceive and who seek in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is however lacking. An additional randomised trial demonstrated that in women trying to conceive the ovarian response to stimulation, as part of fertility treatment, is better in women who have undergone surgery to remove the cyst rather than draining and destroying the endometrioma. The subsequent likelihood of pregnancy was not affected.</P>
<P>Further research is required in this field to assess quality of life after surgery, clarify the effect of surgery on fertility with IVF treatment and to study the effect of surgery on ovarian function.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured over a laparotomy approach as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs. Currently the commonest procedures for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata are either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-04-04 23:51:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique for treating an ovarian endometrioma, either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall, measuring the outcomes improvement in pain symptoms and fertility. The primary endpoints assessed were the relief of pain and, in women desiring to conceive, the subsequent pregnancy rate (either spontaneous or as part of fertility treatment). Secondary outcomes assessed were the recurrence of the endometrioma and the recurrence of symptoms.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-05 00:05:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata, size greater than 3 cm, for the primary symptom of pain were included. For the primary outcome measures laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56). In those women subsequently attempting to conceive excision of the cyst wall was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior subfertility (OR 5.21, 95% CI 2.04 to13.29) compared to women who underwent laparoscopic ablation of the endometrioma. For the secondary outcome measures laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.93) and with a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79) compared with surgery to ablate the endometrioma. A further randomised study was identified that demonstrated an increased ovarian follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for women who had undergone excisional surgery when compared to ablative surgery (mean difference (MD) 0.6, 95% CI 0.04 to1.16). There is insufficient evidence to support excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chances of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.15).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-05 00:06:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is good evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of pain symptoms, and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However in women who may subsequently undergo fertility treatment, insufficient evidence exists to determine the favoured surgical approach.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-04-05 09:55:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is a common condition associated with pelvic pain and infertility in women. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of ectopic deposits of endometrial tissue that are usually, but not exclusively, limited to the pelvis and may lead to infertility and pelvic pain. The deposits may be present in up to 22% of asymptomatic women and up to 45% of women with pelvic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ajossa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajossa 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2000</LINK>). For almost a century, it has been believed by the majority of academic opinion that endometriosis is a disease caused by shedding of menstrual endometrium and its dissemination throughout the pelvis (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-1920" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 1920</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1927a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1927a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1927b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1927b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The origin of ovarian endometriomata is unknown, however it is generally believed that they result initially from a deposit of endometrium passed through the Fallopian tube (the transplantation theory) (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1927a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1927a</LINK>) causing adherence of the ovary to the pelvic peritoneum and progressive invagination (folding inwards) of the ovary (<LINK REF="REF-Brosens-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brosens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosens 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughesdon-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughesdon 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nisolle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nisolle 1997</LINK>). If this is true, an endometrioma would be a pseudocyst (false cyst), the wall of which is the inverted ovarian cortex (centre). Hence the removal of this cyst wall might involve removal of normal ovarian tissue with possible adverse implications for future fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 2003a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-04-05 10:04:15 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary indications for treatment of ovarian endometriomata are the symptoms of pelvic pain and dyspareunia (pain during or after sexual intercourse) (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1997</LINK>) and that the endometriomata may impair the positive outcome of fertility treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Yanushpolsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanushpolsky 1998</LINK>). There is also a small risk of malignant (cancerous) transformation (<LINK REF="REF-Nishida-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishida 2000</LINK>). The evidence suggests that although medical treatment will result in a reduction in size of the endometrioma, by up to 57%, the most effective approach to treatment is surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1998</LINK>). In addition, if they are left they have a risk of rupture and torsion as with any ovarian cyst .</P>
<P>In recent years, laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the treatment of ovarian endometriotic cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Daniell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donnez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yuen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuen 1997</LINK>). When compared to traditional surgery by laparotomy, operative laparoscopy is associated with shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery, decreased costs (<LINK REF="REF-Luciano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luciano 1992</LINK>) and lower incidence of de novo adhesion formation (<LINK REF="REF-Luciano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luciano 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luciano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luciano 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundorff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundorff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OLSG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">OLSG 1991</LINK>). The pregnancy rates, monthly fecundity and cyst recurrence rates are comparable after laparoscopic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Busacca-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busacca 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Canis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Catalano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milingos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milingos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawada-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawada 1999</LINK>). Laparoscopic surgery for endometriomata does carry a risk of conversion to laparotomy. This is associated with the experience of the surgeon, the complexity of the surgery as well as patient factors, such as body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-Sokol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 2003</LINK>). A randomised trial of laparotomy or laparoscopy for the management of endometriomata demonstrated benefits to the patient with regard to less analgesic requirement, earlier discharge and postoperative recovery in those women operated by laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Mais-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mais 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The procedure of drainage of the endometrioma alone is not recommended due to the high rate of recurrence of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Donnez-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1992</LINK>). However, the most effective method of laparoscopic surgery (excisional or ablative) remains controversial.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-04-05 10:18:29 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several alternative laparoscopic techniques have been described for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata. These are cyst wall laser vaporization (destruction by burning) preceded or not by medical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brosens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosens 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donnez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1997</LINK>), drainage and coagulation, and stripping (<LINK REF="REF-Canis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reich-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reich 1986</LINK>). Excision of the cyst involves the opening of the endometrioma either with or without the use of electrosurgical or laser energy. The wall of the endometrioma is then excised or 'stripped away' from the underlying cortex using a combination of scissors (or a monopolar hook) and grasping forceps. Ablation of the endometrioma also involves the opening and drainage of the endometrioma, or fenestration (making a window in the wall of the cyst), followed by the destruction of the cyst wall using either electrosurgical current, cutting or coagulating current, or a form of laser energy (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>). Whatever the surgical modality employed to treat the cyst, a sample of the endometrioma must be sent for histological assessment as there is a need to confirm the clinical diagnosis; and there is the need to exclude the presence of malignancy as the risk of malignant transformation of the cyst is approximately 0.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Brinton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brinton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Carmen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Carmen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishida-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishida 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recurrence rate of ovarian endometrioma following surgery has been previously reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 2003a</LINK>. In this study, endometrioma recurrence was observed in 39 of 212 (18.4%) women treated with coagulation or laser vaporisation and in 19 of 295 (6.4%) who underwent excision. This meta-analysis also reported that the pregnancy rates following surgery were 24% to 60%, with conflicting data regarding the most favourable surgical approach (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 2003a</LINK>). Techniques to limit the recurrence of endometriomata after surgery, while not the subject of the review, included use of the oral contraceptive pill and the Mirena intrauterine system and should be studied further (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 2003b</LINK>). The effect of an ovarian endometrioma on fertility is unclear as it is rare to have a solitary endometrioma without surrounding pelvic endometriotic disease. Indeed, even minimal endometriosis is associated with subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Pritts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritts 2003</LINK>) and its treatment has been demonstrated to improve fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2003</LINK>). The presence of an endometrioma during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles has been associated with the need for greater ovarian stimulation and the production of fewer follicles following stimulation, suggesting that the endometrioma may be compromising ovarian function (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Azemi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Azemi 2000</LINK>). However, the impact of endometriomata on the outcome of fertility treatment is controversial as some studies have failed to demonstrate an adverse effect of endometriomata on IVF outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Velasco 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that the technique of ovarian endometrioma capsule excision may lead to removal of normal ovarian tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Hachisuga-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hachisuga 2002</LINK>). The procedure of capsule ablation may lead to thermal (heat) damage to the underlying ovarian cortex and a risk of incomplete destruction of the endometriotic tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Maouris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maouris 2002</LINK>). Hence both interventions may lead to ovarian cortical damage and a functional loss in the ovarian reserve. There is a need to review the existing literature to determine the optimum surgical management of ovarian endometriomata with regard to the recurrence rate of the endometrioma, pain relief afforded by the surgery, ovarian function and the effect on subsequent fertility and impact on the women's quality of life.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Baseline characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>Indication for surgery: in all randomised controlled trials of the laparoscopic approach the indication for surgery was the presence of an endometrioma of greater than 3 cm in size, assessed by ultrasound examination. Women were excluded if they had had a previous operative intervention for endometriosis or hormonal or suppressive therapy for the preceding six months (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). Women were aged between 20 and 40 years of age in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>), had a mean age of 28 years in both groups in a second (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>) and in the third study the mean age of the women was 24.4 years in the ablation group and 26.2 years in the excision group (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type of surgery performed: the procedure of laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata was compared in the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). In these studies ovarian cystectomy, stripping and total excision of the capsule of the endometrioma by pulling two atraumatic grasping forceps in opposite directions, was compared with the procedure of tissue biopsy, drainage and subsequent ablation of endometrioma by bipolar coagulation of its capsule.</P>
<P>Adjuvants to surgery: no adjuvants to surgery were employed (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Follow up: in one study follow up was two years (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>); in one study women were followed for up to 26 months, median follow up 20 months in the excisional group and 19.5 months in the drainage and ablation group (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>); and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK> follow up was for two cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, which was commenced at least two months after surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Studied outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Relief of pelvic pain by laparoscopic surgery excision or ablation of ovarian endometriomata: the percentage of women with significant pelvic pain remaining after surgery was derived from the publications and from contacting the authors for clarification. Due to the discomfort of the operative procedures themselves a formal comparison of the two operative techniques immediately post operation is problematical (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). The recurrence of pelvic pain was assessed by visual analogue scores in one publication (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>) and by dichotomous data recording in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>). One paper reported the effect on pain by dividing the general term 'pain' into the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain. Pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale and reporting classed as moderate or severe (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect on fertility with laparoscopic surgery excision or ablation of ovarian endometriomata: two studies recorded details on a subset of women who subsequently desired to conceive. In both studies the effect on fertility was recorded as the time taken to spontaneous conception and the percentage of women conceiving naturally (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). In one paper follow up was limited to 12 months, to allow women to then seek fertility treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>); in the other paper follow up was extended to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). One study recorded the pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>) without specifying the method of confirmation of pregnancy and one paper confirmed pregnancy by the presence of a gestational sac on ultrasound examination (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK> reported the ovarian response and subsequent pregnancy rate after two cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation in groups of women who had undergone either ablation or excision of endometriomata.</P>
<P>The effect on recurrence of an endometrioma documented by regular and frequent ultrasound examination: in two studies the recurrence rate of an ovarian endometrioma was recorded by ultrasound examination every three months for the first year and then either six monthly (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>) or annually (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>The need for a further operation subsequent to laparoscopic surgery: two studies reported the requirement for further surgery after the initial laparoscopic procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Relief from pelvic pain: two studies of 164 women that met the inclusion criteria for the laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomas for the treatment of pain reported results that suggested that both excision and drainage and coagulation of endometriomata treated the symptom 100% effectively in all cases, after short-term follow up. Both authors were contacted for further clarification and confirmed this assertion (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>).<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
</P>
<P>The time to the recurrence of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain was significantly shorter in the drainage and ablation group (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>); and the time to the recurrence of pain was significantly shorter in the <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK> study. The total number of women with a recurrence of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhoea was significantly lower in the drainage and ablation group in the <LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK> study. After contacting the authors of this study, they were unable to differentiate between those women with recurrence of pain and recurrence of dysmenorrhoea alone, consequently these women were analysed as recurrence of dysmenorrhoea only in the analysis and were excluded from the analysis of non-menstrual pain and dyspareunia. The laparoscopic excision of endometriomata was significantly associated with a benefit on the recurrence of dysmenorrhoea (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38), recurrence of dyspareunia (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51) and recurrence of non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56) compared to drainage and ablation. <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>
</P>
<P>Subsequent spontaneous conception at one and two years: two studies assessed a subset of their women who desired to conceive after surgery to treat pain. In one of the studies women were followed up for one year and at this time the spontaneous pregnancy rate was significantly greater in the excision group (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>). In the other study follow up was performed for 24 months and the spontaneous conception rate observed (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). The Berreta paper was analysed and the 12 month spontaneous fecundity derived and plotted. After combining with the Alborzi paper, the chance of a spontaneous pregnancy at up to 12 months significantly favoured laparoscopic excision of endometriomata (OR 5.24, 95% CI 1.92 to14.27). The overall subsequent spontaneous conception rate also favoured laparoscopic excision (OR 5.21, 95% CI 2.04 to13.29). One study investigated the reproductive outcome after the two surgical modalities for women who underwent fertility treatment; there was insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to pregnancy outcome after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (1.40, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.15) (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>

There was no significant difference when each patient acted as their own control by comparing the treated and untreated ovaries (-0.2 (95% CI -0.90 to 0.50) for ablative surgery and -0.0 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.47) for excisional surgery).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-10 13:41:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>This review addresses the controversial issue of the most appropriate surgical approach to the management of endometriomata, either excision or drainage and ablation of the cyst. There were no randomised studies identified where the approach to the management of the endometrioma was by laparotomy. A randomised trial of laparotomy or laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy for the management of endometriomata has demonstrated the benefits to the patient of the laparoscopic approach, manifested by less analgesic requirement, earlier discharge and a shorter postoperative recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Mais-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mais 1996</LINK>). Consequently this discussion focuses on the laparoscopic approach to the management of ovarian endometriomata.</P>
<P>The three studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis have the potential for bias, derived from the fact that both patient and surgeon were not blinded to the procedure performed (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). Both studies of the management of endometriomas to treat pain had full retention of women for the two years of follow up, with regular interim review. The studies had very similar design and inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the analysis there was no statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>An assessment of the effect of excision of an endometriomas versus drainage and ablation on 'relief from pelvic pain' was impossible to derive as both studies suggested complete relief of pelvic pain with both approaches. This highlights the difficulty in determining when the initial assessment should be made after the completion of surgery. However, the outcome variable 'recurrence of pelvic pain' was significantly worse in the drainage and ablation treatment arms. The concern that this may not be related to the management of the endometrioma but to the background disease of endometriosis can be partially discounted as in both studies there was no difference in the disease severity between the two treatment modalities; although it is well established that the extent of disease does not correlate directly to the symptoms experienced by the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>). In the analysis of the recurrence of pelvic pain, one of the studies only analysed the recurrence of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>). The authors were approached but were unable to provide further information as to the recurrence of other symptoms. This meta-analysis demonstrates that excisional surgery for the management of endometriomata is associated with a reduced recurrence rate of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and non-menstrual pelvic pain when compared to drainage and ablation of the cyst. Consequently, the excision of an endometrioma should be the favoured operative approach for the management of endometriomata for the indication of pain.</P>
<P>The recurrence rate of the endometrioma was analysed in two studies that met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). These studies both followed the women in their studies for up to two years and demonstrated there was a significantly reduced rate of recurrence in the women who underwent excisional surgery. In addition, there was a reduced requirement for further surgery in the excisional group (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies addressed spontaneous pregnancy after surgery, in those women desiring to conceive (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>). One of these studies followed up the women for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>) and one study for one year, prior to them being referred for assisted reproduction (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2004</LINK>). Both studies were rigorous in their inclusion in the subfertile group, only women without a cause for their subfertility other than their pelvic pathology. The meta-analysis of the rate of spontaneous conception demonstrated a significantly greater rate of conception in the excisional group. From the information supplied in their publication (<LINK REF="STD-Beretta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beretta 1998</LINK>), the spontaneous conception rate at one year was derived as this is a commonly used follow-up time to allow for spontaneous conception before referral for assisted reproduction. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2007</LINK>) compared the ovarian follicular response to ovarian stimulation with clomiphene and gonadotrophins and determined a significantly more favourable response to stimulation in women who had undergone excisional surgery. There appeared to be no difference, however, in the responses for an individual patient when their operated and un operated ovaries were compared. Furthermore, there was no difference in subsequent pregnancy rates after ovarian stimulation between women who had undergone excisional or ablative treatment for their endometrioma, although no power calculation was provided to determine if the numbers of women studied were sufficient to detect a difference.</P>
<P>No study was found that addressed the issue of patient satisfaction or quality of life, or ovarian function after surgery. These should be priorities for further research.</P>
<P>As there are only two studies that address the issue of the most effective surgical approach to the management of endometriomata for the indication of pain, and only one study that addresses the issue of the ovarian response to stimulation after surgery, the possibility of publication bias exists.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-05 12:43:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and non-menstrual pelvic pain. For those women subsequently attempting to conceive, excision was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior subfertility when compared to laparoscopic ablation of the endometrioma. The secondary outcomes were a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma and reduced requirement for further surgery in women who underwent laparoscopic excision of an endometrioma as opposed to women who underwent surgery to ablate the endometrioma.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-05 12:46:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies identified were sufficient to address the objectives of the review with regard to the time to recurrence of symptoms, recurrence of an endometrioma and spontaneous pregnancy. The studies were insufficient to derive information with regard to the most effective treatment for subsequent clinical pregnancy and live birth rate as a result of fertility treatment, the conversion from a planned laparoscopic procedure to a laparotomy approach, subsequent ovarian function and quality of life measures.</P>

<P>We believe the evidence identified by this review allows a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review, which were to determine whether laparoscopic surgical excision or ablation is the optimum surgical management of ovarian endometriomata with respect to pain and fertility outcomes. The summary risk of bias table shows the authors' judgement of the methodological quality of the trials included, which demonstrates that randomisation and allocation of concealment were free of bias and that although there was no blinding of the patients or doctors all patients were followed up and there was no selective outcome reporting. </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-04-05 12:49:16 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strength of this review is the comprehensive review of the English literature and meetings. A potential limitation of the review may be that some studies in the non-English literature may have been overlooked, which potentially could introduce a bias, although it would be expected that significant research would be presented at a major international meeting and would have been detected in the review process.</P>

<P>There is good evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms, subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously infertile and ovarian response to stimulation. Consequently, excisional surgery should be the favoured surgical approach for the management of an endometrioma. However in women who undergo ovarian stimulation after surgery, as part of fertility treatment, there is currently insufficient evidence to favour one approach over the other with regard to the subsequent pregnancy rate. There are no studies that compare the two surgical approaches in women prior to undergoing IVF treatment.</P>
