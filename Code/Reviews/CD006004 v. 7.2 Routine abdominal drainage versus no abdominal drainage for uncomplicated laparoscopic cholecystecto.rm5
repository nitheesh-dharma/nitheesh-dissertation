<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-30 12:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The liver produces bile which has many functions, including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult western population. Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Drain is a tube that is left inside the tummy to allow drainage of fluids to outside the tummy. Some surgeons have routinely drained after laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of the fear of collection of bile or blood requiring re-operation. As the name indicates, the drain may drain out these collections to the exterior, thereby avoiding open surgery. However, routine use of drains may necessitate the patient to stay overnight or require drain removal after discharge both of which increase resource utilisation in this era of day surgery (where patients are admitted and discharged on the same day of surgery). The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to use routine drainage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.</P>
<P>A total of 1831 participants received drain (915 patients) versus 'no drain' (916 patients) in 12 trials included in this review. The decision of whether the patients received drain or not was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin. Only two trials including 199 patients were of low risk of bias (free from errors in study design that can result in wrong conclusions, leading to overestimation of benefits and to underestimation of harms of the drainage or no drainage). Nine of the 12 trials included patients who underwent planned operations. The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information. The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information. There was no significant or clinically important differences in the short-term mortality, serious complications, quality of life, length of hospital stay, operating time, return to normal activity, or return to work in the trials that reported these outcomes. The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than in the 'no drain' group in one trial of high risk of bias involving 68 participants. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.</P>

<P>A total of 1831 participants were randomised to drain (915 participants) versus 'no drain' (916 participants) in 12 trials included in this review. Only two trials including 199 participants were of low risk of bias. Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively. One trial included patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis exclusively. One trial included patients undergoing elective and emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and one trial did not provide this information. The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information. The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information. There was no significant difference between the drain group (1/840) (adjusted proportion: 0.1%) and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.37) in short-term mortality in the ten trials with 1681 participants reporting on this outcome. There was no significant difference between the drain group (7/567) (adjusted proportion: 1.1%) and the 'no drain' group (3/576) (0.5%) in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events in the seven trials with 1143 participants reporting on this outcome (RR 2.12; 95% CI 0.67 to 7.40) or in the number of serious adverse events in each group reported by eight trials with 1286 participants; drain group (12/646) (adjusted rate: 1.5 events per 100 participants) versus 'no drain' group (6/640) (0.9 events per 100 participants); rate ratio 1.60; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.87). There was no significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups (one trial; 93 participants; SMD 0.22; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.63). The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (one trial; 68 participants; drain group (0/33) (adjusted proportion: 0.2%) versus 'no drain' group (11/35) (31.4%); RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.75). There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (five trials; 449 participants; MD 0.22 days; 95% CI -0.06 days to 0.51 days). The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (seven trials; 775 participants; MD 5.00 minutes; 95% CI 2.69 minutes to 7.30 minutes). There was no significant difference in the return to normal activity and return to work between the groups in one trial involving 100 participants. This trial did not provide any information from which the standard deviation could be imputed and so the confidence intervals could not be calculated for these outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-29 16:23:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>About 5% to 25% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of gallstones is about 1 in 200 people (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Only 2% to 4% of people with gallstones become symptomatic with biliary colic (pain), acute cholecystitis (inflammation), obstructive jaundice, or gallstone pancreatitis in a year (<LINK REF="REF-Attili-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attili 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Cholecystectomy (removal of gallstones) is the preferred option in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Strasberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasberg 1993</LINK>). Every year, 1.5 million cholecystectomies are performed in the US and 60,000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HES-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2011</LINK>). Approximately 80% of the cholecystectomies are performed laparoscopically (by key-hole surgery) (<LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-29 16:25:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Routine drainage involves insertion of a drain into the abdominal cavity on completion of surgery. The drain is brought out usually through one of the ports (key-hole) used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgical drains may either be open or closed. An open drain is when an artificial conduit is left in the wound to allow drainage of fluids to the exterior (eg, corrugated drain; Penrose drain; Yeates drain). Closed drains may either be suction drains (eg, Redon drain) or passive (gravity-assisted) drains (eg, Robinson drain).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-04-29 13:25:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also planned to report the risk difference if it was different from the RR since risk difference allows meta-analysis including trials with zero events in both groups. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for hospital stay; and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for variables such as quality of life. For count outcomes such as number of serious adverse events, we calculated the rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>

If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the CIs, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation will decrease the weight of the trial for calculation of mean differences and bias the effect estimate to no effect in the case of standardised mean difference (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>We used trial sequential analysis to control for random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of the accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis resulting in an increased risk of random errors (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, we added the trials alphabetically according to the last name of the first author. We constructed the trial sequential monitoring boundaries on the basis of the required information size. These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size; if the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed before the required information size is reached, firm evidence may perhaps be established and further trials may turn out to be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundary is not surpassed, it may be necessary to continue doing trials in order to detect or reject a certain intervention effect (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).   </P>
<P>We applied trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) using a diversity-analysed required sample size calculated from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, a control event proportion obtained from the results of the meta-analysis, and a relative risk reduction of 20% for binary primary outcomes and the observed diversity of the meta-analysis (mortality and serious adverse events) with two or more trials to determine whether more trials are necessary on this topic (if the trial sequential monitoring boundary or the futility zone is crossed, then more trials may be unnecessary) (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-30 12:46:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This review has shown no significant advantage of using a drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The main reasons for using routine abdominal drainage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to decrease the complications such as intra-abdominal collections that require treatment and to detect bile leak, thereby decreasing the overall mortality and morbidity associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the proportion of patients who develop these complications are less than 0.5% as indicated in this review. In order to detect a clinically relevant difference (say a relative risk reduction of 20%), more than 150,000 participants are required. The total number of participants included in this review was only 1801 participants. Thus, the absence of significant difference between the two groups may either be due to lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. Although there was insufficient participants to identify clinically relevant differences in mortality and morbidity, one would have expected longer hospital stay in the 'no drain' group if the morbidity was higher. However, there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups. One can consider the confidence intervals to be narrow since the confidence intervals did not overlap 1 or -1 day as the minimal clinically relevant difference for hospital stay is one day. On the other hand, the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed lower in the drain group than the 'no drain' group in the only trial that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hawasli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hawasli 1994</LINK>). These findings suggest that the possibility of shorter hospital stay in the drain group versus the 'no drain' group (and hence a lower mortality and morbidity in the drain group compared to the 'no drain' group) may be unlikely.</P>
<P>The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group than the 'no drain' group but the difference was only five minutes, which does not appear to be clinically significant or result in increased resource utilisation. However, drain use may result in increased resource utilisation in a different way. Most of the trials in which the duration of drain was reported retained the drain for about 24 hours. This would mean that the patient has to either stay in hospital until the drain is removed or has to go home with the drain necessitating drain removal by a visit to the hospital on the next day or a community nurse visiting the patient at home on the next day. This clearly involves additional resource utilisation. Considering that there is no evidence for any benefit for the drain, this additional resource utilisation does not appear to be justified.</P>

<P>Most of the trials included in this review included only adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (nine of the twelve trials). So, this review is applicable only in adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence to suggest that the rationale for drain use is any different in children or in patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy (one trial showed that there was no evidence for any benefit from drain use in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis (<LINK REF="STD-Lucarelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lucarelli 2012</LINK>)).</P>

<P>We performed a thorough search of literature. However, we cannot rule out trials not being reported because of lack of benefit of drain use. This is unlikely to affect our conclusions. We imputed the mean and standard deviation when these were not available. Excluding the trials in which such imputation was performed did not alter the conclusions. Overall, the evidence from this review can be considered the best available evidence on this topic.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 1651 patients in the 10 trials, only 0.47% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, not even the conventional boundaries were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of serious adverse events </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 175,965 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.4%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 1113 patients in the seven trials, only 0.63% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, not even the conventional boundaries were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>
