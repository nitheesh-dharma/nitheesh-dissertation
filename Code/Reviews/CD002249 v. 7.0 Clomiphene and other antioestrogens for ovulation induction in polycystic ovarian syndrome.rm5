<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Do antioestrogens including clomiphene improve fertility in women with anovulation associated with polycystic ovary syndrome?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Subfertility due to the absence of ovulation is a common problem in women. Medical treatment may help these women ovulate. For example, oral antioestrogens such as clomiphene cause increased stimulation of the ovaries and aid ovulation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We added 13 new studies in the 2016 update, and the review now includes 28 trials (3377 women). Five of the 28 included trials reported live birth. Miscarriage, multiple pregnancy rates, and adverse events such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were poorly reported. The evidence is current to August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found evidence suggesting that clomiphene citrate improves the chance of a clinical pregnancy compared with placebo.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between clomiphene and tamoxifen, a similar antioestrogen drug. Women treated with clomiphene citrate were less likely to get pregnant or have a live baby compared with women who had received gonadotropins; there was no evidence for a difference in the chance of a multiple pregnancy. The numbers of women getting pregnant in these trials were very small, therefore we cannot be certain of the results.</P>
<P>Both dexamethasone (a steroid) and combined oral contraceptives are used to supplement clomiphene and show promise, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Few studies reported beyond the establishment of early pregnancy; given the reported risks of miscarriage with clomiphene treatment, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about effective treatment. We found evidence suggesting that a 10-day regimen of clomiphene citrate improved pregnancy outcomes when compared with a 5-day regimen, although the volume of data is limited and further research is required. There were insufficient data reported for early versus late regimens of clomiphene citrate to be able to make a judgement on differences for pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. The primary reasons for downgrading evidence were imprecision and risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:20:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Subfertility due to anovulation is a common problem in women. First-line oral treatment is with antioestrogens such as clomiphene citrate, but resistance may be apparent with clomiphene. Alternative and adjunctive treatments have been used including tamoxifen, dexamethasone, and bromocriptine. The effectiveness of these is to be determined.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-12-08 16:54:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the relative effectiveness of antioestrogen agents including clomiphene alone or in combination with other medical therapies in women with subfertility associated with anovulation, possibly caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:30:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a search of the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (all from inception to August 2016) to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and the references of relevant reviews and RCTs. We also searched the clinical trial registries for ongoing trials (inception until August 2016).</P>

<P>This is a substantive update of a previous review. We identified an additional 13 studies in the 2016 update. The review now includes 28 RCTs (3377 women) and five RCTs awaiting classification. Five of the 28 included trials reported live birth/ongoing pregnancy. Secondary outcomes were poorly reported.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. The primary reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision and risk of bias associated with poor reporting.</P>

</P>
<P>No data were reported for these outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical pregnancy rate</I>
</P>
<P>Clomiphene citrate was associated with an increased chance of a clinical pregnancy compared with placebo, though the size of the benefit was very uncertain (odds ratio (OR) 5.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.77 to 19.68; 3 studies; 133 women; low-quality evidence). If the chance of a clinical pregnancy was 5% in the placebo group, then between 8% and 50% of women would have a clinical pregnancy in the clomiphene group.</P>
<P>
<B>Clomiphene citrate versus tamoxifen</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Live birth rate</I>
</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of a difference in the chance of a live birth between the clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen groups (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.62; 2 studies; 195 women; low-quality evidence). If 20% of women in the tamoxifen group had a live birth, then between 13% and 40% of women in the clomiphene citrate group would have a live birth.</P>
<P>
<I>Miscarriage rate</I>
</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of a difference in the chance of a miscarriage between the clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen groups (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.12; 4 studies; 653 women; low-quality evidence). If 3% of women in the tamoxifen group had a miscarriage, then between 2% and 10% in the clomiphene citrate group would have a miscarriage.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical pregnancy rate</I>
</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of a difference in the chance of a clinical pregnancy between the clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen groups (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.85; 5 studies; 757 women; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 69%; low-quality evidence). If 22% of women in the tamoxifen group had a clinical pregnancy, then between 21% and 35% in the clomiphene citrate group would have a clinical pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple pregnancy rate </I>
</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence of a difference in the chance of a multiple pregnancy between the clomiphene citrate group (OR 2.34, 95% CI 0.34 to 16.04; 3 studies; 567 women; very low-quality evidence). If 0% of women in the tamoxifen group had a multiple pregnancy, then between 0% and 0.5% of women in the clomiphene group would have a multiple pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>OHSS</I>
</P>
<P>There were no instances of OHSS in either the clomiphene citrate or the tamoxifen group reported from three studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Clomiphene citrate with tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical pregnancy rate</I>
</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between groups (OR 3.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 91.60; 1 study; 20 women; very low-quality evidence). No data were reported for the other outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Other comparisons of interest</B>
</P>
<P>Limited evidence suggested that compared with a gonadotropin, clomiphene citrate was associated with a reduced chance of a pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, or live birth, with no clear evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rates.</P>
<P>The comparison of clomiphene citrate plus medical adjunct versus clomiphene alone was limited by the number of trials reporting the comparison and poor reporting of clinical outcomes relevant to this systematic review and by the number of adjuncts reported (ketoconazole, bromocriptine, dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive, human chorionic gonadotropin, hormone supplementation). The addition of dexamethasone or combined oral contraceptive suggested a possible benefit in pregnancy outcomes, but findings were very uncertain and further research is required to confirm this.</P>
<P>There was limited evidence suggesting that a 10-day regimen of clomiphene citrate improves pregnancy outcomes compared with a 5-day regimen. Data for early versus late regimens of clomiphene citrate were insufficient to be able to make a judgement on differences for pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-08 17:04:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found evidence suggesting that clomiphene citrate improves the chance of a clinical pregnancy compared with placebo, but may reduce the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy when compared with a gonadotropin. Due to low event rates, we advise caution interpreting these data.</P>
<P>The comparison of clomiphene citrate plus medical adjunctive versus clomiphene alone was limited by the number of trials reporting the comparison. The evidence was very low quality and no firm conclusions could be drawn, but very limited evidence suggested a benefit from adjunctive dexamethasone or combined oral contraceptives. Low-quality evidence suggested that a 10-day regimen of clomiphene citrate improves pregnancy rates compared with a 5-day regimen, but further research is required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-14 15:16:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 12:52:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anovulation and oligo-ovulation are estimated to be the cause 21% of female infertility. The World Health Organization (WHO) splits the causes into the following three categories (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Group 1: hypothalamic pituitary failure or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, accounting for around 10% of ovulatory disorders</LI>
<LI>Group 2: hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction or eugonadotropic, 85% of ovulatory disorders</LI>
<LI>Group 3: ovarian failure or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4% to 5% of ovulatory disorders</LI>
</UL>
<P>Group 2 is the subject of this review. This group consists predominantly of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but may also include women with hyperprolactinaemia and those with unexplained anovulation. PCOS is a common condition of uncertain aetiology occurring in 4% to 7% of women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2000</LINK>). The syndrome was first described in 1935 and was first known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome. In the past the diagnostic criteria for PCOS have varied. A recent consensus meeting between the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine decided on the criteria, based upon majority opinion and not clinical trial data (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE_x002f_ASRM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE/ASRM 2003</LINK>). Two of the following three factors are required for diagnosis of PCOS, with exclusion of other aetiologies such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumours, hyperprolactinaemia, and Cushing's syndrome:</P>
<UL>
<LI>oligo-ovulation or anovulation;</LI>
<LI>clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, or both;</LI>
<LI>polycystic ovaries as seen on ultrasound scanning.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Common symptoms and signs of PCOS include hirsutism, acne, irregular menstrual bleeding, and obesity. Investigations of women with PCOS may show raised luteinising hormone (LH) and free testosterone levels. Features on ultrasound scanning are enlarged ovaries (volume greater than 10 mL) or equal to or greater than 12 follicles 2 mm to 9 mm or greater in size diffusely distributed on one or both ovaries, or both (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE_x002f_ASRM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE/ASRM 2003</LINK>). Women with PCOS may be at increased risk of pregnancy loss and complications and endometrial carcinoma. Their cardiovascular risk is also raised due to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and altered serum lipid profiles (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2000</LINK>). Women with PCOS are more likely to be diagnosed with infertility and to undergo in vitro fertilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>During normal menstruation, oestrogen levels are low, while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH levels begin to rise. This stimulates the development of an ovarian follicle which produces androgens (male sex hormones), some of which are bound to sex hormone binding globulin and some of which circulate freely in the bloodstream. Some androgens are converted to oestrogens. This causes a rise in the level of oestrogen, which in turn causes a fall in FSH and LH levels. The oestrogen levels continue to rise, eventually causing an LH surge, which triggers ovulation. Following ovulation a corpus luteum is formed which produces progesterone as well as oestrogen. The purpose of the corpus luteum is to prepare the endometrium for embryo implantation and for the maintenance of early pregnancy.</P>
<P>In PCOS there is a state of chronic anovulation characterised by small ovarian cysts, elevated ovarian production of androgens, and sometimes hypersecretion of LH. PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. With the new criteria being wider than previously accepted definitions, its diagnosis is even more frequent (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE_x002f_ASRM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE/ASRM 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hyperprolactinaemia (which is included in the WHO group 2 category) is not included in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen</HEADING>
<P>Medical ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate is currently the first-line treatment for anovulatory women. Clomiphene citrate is an antioestrogen and competes for receptor-binding sites with endogenous oestrogens. Recently published United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines state that first-line treatment for WHO group 2 anovulation should be clomiphene citrate (or tamoxifen) for up to 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). The recommended daily dose of clomiphene citrate is 50 mg to 100 mg with a maximum of 250 mg. However, clomiphene resistance (failure to ovulate after taking clomiphene) is common, occurring in approximately 15% to 40% of women with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Kousta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kousta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pritts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2000</LINK>). Definitions of clomiphene resistance vary, but the NICE definition is: "Anovulatory women who do not ovulate while receiving the 150 mg dose of clomiphene citrate" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Resistance is associated with an increased body mass index, and weight loss programmes improve the success rates of clomiphene citrate therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kousta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kousta 1997</LINK>). Alternative and adjunctive treatments have been sought due to the high incidence of clomiphene resistance.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dexamethasone as an adjunct</HEADING>
<P>Addition of oral dexamethasone, a steroid hormone, to clomiphene citrate has been advocated in order to improve the chances of ovulation and subsequent pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Bromocriptine as an adjunct</HEADING>
<P>Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist used to treat hyperprolactinaemia, has been studied as an adjunctive treatment to clomiphene-induced ovulation in anovulatory women with PCOS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Aromatase inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>The use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) to treat anovulatory infertility is a new indication. Proponents of AIs believe that they are superior to, and safer than, clomiphene citrate. The latest form of these drugs ('third generation' anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) are currently being used as a treatment for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Mitwally-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitwally 2004</LINK>). Aromatase inhibitors are not included in this review, as they are the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Franik-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franik 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">CYP17a inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>Ketoconazole is a CYP17a inhibitor. It inhibits a different part of the cytochrome P450 complex to AIs. Ketoconazole inhibits aromatase activity in the gonads (<LINK REF="STD-Hassan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hassan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsanezhad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsanezhad 2003</LINK>), and therefore may have similar effects to AIs with added antiandrogenic effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Metformin and other insulin-sensitising agents alone or as an adjunct</HEADING>
<P>A feature of PCOS is hyperinsulinaemia due to insulin resistance. This is thought to increase androgen production by the ovaries. Metformin and other insulin-sensitising agents (e.g. troglitazone, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol) are thought to help correct this and therefore increase ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2012</LINK>). Use of insulin-sensitising agents such as metformin are not included in this review, as they are the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Gonadotropins</HEADING>
<P>Gonadotropins are a long-standing treatment for clomiphene-resistant women. A variety of injectable drugs are available (human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), urinary FSH, and recombinant FSH). These all have problems related to cost, risk of multiple pregnancy, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is also sometimes used. This involves pulsatile GnRH infusion by intravenous or subcutaneous route using a portable pump. Cost and effect are likely similar to that of hMG treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bayram-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayram 2004</LINK>), but there may be a reduced risk of multiple pregnancy and OHSS (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1996</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen </HEADING>
<P>By blocking receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, clomiphene citrate interferes with the feedback mechanism of endogenous oestrogen on the pituitary and hypothalamus. The result is an increase in FSH and LH secretion by the pituitary, which stimulates the production of ovarian follicles and ovulation. Estimates for numbers of women conceiving with clomiphene therapy vary from 30% to 50%, in <LINK REF="REF-Kousta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kousta 1997</LINK>, to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Approximately 7% of pregnancies resulting from clomiphene-induced ovulation are twin pregnancies, and 0.5% are triplet pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2000</LINK>). Miscarriage rates of 13% to 25% have been reported with clomiphene-induced conceptions (<LINK REF="REF-Kousta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kousta 1997</LINK>). This proportion may be higher than in women with normal fertility and unassisted conception, but this is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2013</LINK>). A more advanced age may be responsible, and beyond that it is not possible to separate the adverse effects of treatment from the underlying process leading to subfertility. OHSS has been reported rarely following clomiphene citrate use. Tamoxifen has been used to induce ovulation but is used much less frequently than clomiphene citrate (<LINK REF="REF-Messinis-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messinis 1982</LINK>); its mode of action is similar to that of clomiphene citrate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dexamethasone as an adjunct</HEADING>
<P>The proposed mechanism of action of dexamethasone in PCOS is suppression of the adrenal production of androgens, which should augment the action of clomiphene. It has also been suggested that dexamethasone may facilitate the growth of ovarian follicles by causing an increase in FSH levels. A third mechanism of action may be to reduce the high pulsatile levels of LH seen in PCOS and which contributes to anovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Brann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brann 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Bromocriptine as an adjunct</HEADING>
<P>Dopamine can reduce elevated LH levels in PCOS and has also been reported to lead to a return in cyclical ovarian activity in normoprolactinaemic women with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Leblanc-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leblanc 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebel 1984</LINK>).</P>

Three trials used a 2 mg dose of dexamethasone (<LINK REF="STD-Elnashar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Elnashar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmaeilzadeh-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Esmaeilzadeh 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsanezhad-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Parsanezhad 2002a</LINK>), and one trial used a 0.5 mg dose (<LINK REF="STD-Daly-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1984</LINK>). The removal of the <LINK REF="STD-Daly-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1984</LINK> trial did not affect the direction of the treatment effect or the statistical significance.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clomiphene citrate versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Analysis of the three trials comparing clomiphene with placebo showed that clomiphene improves the chance of pregnancy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clomiphene citrate versus tamoxifen</HEADING>
<P>Five trials comparing clomiphene with tamoxifen showed no clear evidence of a difference in live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or multiple pregnancy rate. No cases of OHSS were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen versus clomiphene citrate</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen with clomiphene citrate alone. The evidence was insufficient to determine whether there was a difference in clinical pregnancy rates. No other outcomes were reported for this comparison (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clomiphene citrate versus gonadotropin</HEADING>
<P>Three trials compared clomiphene citrate with gonadotropins. Clomiphene citrate was associated with a reduced chance of a clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, or live birth. There was no evidence of a difference between groups for chance of a multiple pregnancy, although event rates were very low and therefore data should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clomiphene citrate plus medical adjunct versus clomiphene citrate</HEADING>
<P>Data were reported for six different medical adjuncts used with clomiphene citrate and compared with clomiphene citrate alone (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>One small study of 80 women reported limited evidence using ketoconazole as an adjunct. There was no evidence of a difference between clomiphene plus ketoconazole and clomiphene alone for miscarriage, clinical pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy. Event rates were low and therefore data should be interpreted with caution. The results are open to some misinterpretation, as the trial authors moved women who failed to respond to 150 mg clomiphene to hMG treatment. No data were provided on the numbers from each group, however it would be reasonable to assume that more women from the control group, with its higher rates of clomiphene resistance, required this.</P>
<P>Two trials reported the use of bromocriptine as an adjunct. There was no evidence of a difference for clinical pregnancy rates between groups. No other relevant outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>Four trials reported using dexamethasone as an adjunct. Clomiphene citrate plus dexamethasone was associated with an increased chance of a clinical pregnancy when compared with clomiphene citrate alone. Three of the four trials used a dose of 2 mg dexamethasone. There was no evidence of a difference between groups for multiple pregnancy. None of the trials used the same protocol for treatment, which could explain the observed heterogeneity. Despite this, dexamethasone shows potential as an inexpensive and non-invasive treatment option for women with PCOS, perhaps especially those who have failed to respond to standard therapy.</P>
<P>One small trial reported on combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill used as an adjunct. Clomiphene citrate plus COC was associated with an increase in clinical pregnancy, with no evidence of a difference in miscarriage or multiple pregnancy rate when compared with clomiphene citrate alone. Event rates and sample size (n = 48 women) were small and therefore data should be interpreted with caution. Further trials are needed to establish if COC is indeed a safe and effective adjunct to clomiphene citrate.</P>
<P>The use of hCG as an adjunct showed no evidence of a difference in miscarriage, clinical pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy rate when compared with clomiphene citrate alone.</P>
<P>Two studies reported hormone supplementation as an adjunct, finding no evidence of a difference in miscarriage or clinical pregnancy. No events were reported for multiple pregnancy or OHSS.</P>

<P>Clomiphene citrate given for 10 days was associated with an increased chance of live birth and clinical pregnancy compared with a 5-day regimen. There was no evidence of a difference for multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data for early versus late regimens were insufficient to be able to draw any conclusions regarding the benefits of one over the other.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-18 11:22:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe we have used rigorous methods to identify published and unpublished trials by searching multiple electronic databases with no restriction on language. Trials were reported from various countries. Many of the comparisons included in this review only had one or two relevant trials, and the sample sizes were small, which increases the risk of imprecision. In particular, data for multiple pregnancies were very limited. The trials that compared an antioestrogen with no treatment or placebo did not report multiple pregnancy as a clinical outcome. There were no data on self reported adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>All of the trials included in this review have methodological flaws, including lack of clarity around randomisation and allocation concealment, lack of blinding, and attrition, which weaken the results.</P>
<P>Using GRADE methodology, we judged the evidence to be of low quality for the comparisons of antioestrogen versus no treatment or placebo (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and antioestrogen versus antioestrogen (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We downgraded much of the evidence for risk of bias and imprecision. More rigorous RCTs are required for all of the interventions.</P>
<P>Live birth rate is the gold-standard primary outcome for RCTs of this nature (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). Only five of the 28 included trials in this review reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Boonstanfar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boonstanfar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elsedeek--2014" TYPE="STUDY">Elsedeek 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homburg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Homburg 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seyedoshohadaei-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Seyedoshohadaei 2012</LINK>). Using pregnancy rate as a surrogate endpoint is of dubious accuracy. Other poorly reported outcomes included adverse effects and incidence of OHSS. OHSS is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ovulation induction therapy; it is an important outcome, but if it did not occur in the trial populations it may not have been reported. Multiple pregnancy was poorly reported, and where data were available, event rates were low, making it uncertain if the interventions were influencing the outcome.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-08 17:02:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have not found strong evidence in favour of one antioestrogen or adjunctive agent. We found evidence supporting the effectiveness of the current first-line treatment, clomiphene citrate, in terms of pregnancies, although there is a reduced chance of clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, or live birth when compared with gonadotropins. It is unclear whether there is a difference in effect between clomiphene plus tamoxifen and clomiphene alone, as the number of women studied was too small to be conclusive. We could find no trials comparing tamoxifen and placebo.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to determine the place of ketoconazole, tamoxifen, bromocriptine, human chorionic gonadotropin, or hormone supplementation as an adjunct to clomiphene versus clomiphene alone in anovulatory, normoprolactinaemic women. Due to the limited reporting of multiple pregnancy as a clinical outcome, we are unable to judge the effect of antioestrogens on this outcome and therefore suggest that the monitoring of ovulation induction with serum hormones and preferably vaginal ultrasound should be considered in order to minimise the risk of multiple gestation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-13 10:28:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clomiphene is currently widely accepted as an effective treatment, and it is unlikely that further trials against placebo will be conducted. Large, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed comparing the long-standing interventions such as clomiphene with the medical adjunctive drugs (in particular dexamethasone), and the newer drugs such as aromatase inhibitors. In addition, studies on the duration of treatment with clomiphene should be planned. Differentiation between results by aetiology of anovulation is also needed in new trials. </P>
<P>We suggest further research is required to confirm the potential benefit in the improved clinical pregnancy rate observed in a single trial comparing a 10-day with a 5-day regimen.</P>
<P>This review reports that currently available trials are often of poor quality and have potentially serious methodological and selective-reporting flaws, primarily due to lack of data on live birth. Randomised controlled trials should follow the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Trials should be of sufficient duration to have live birth as their primary outcome and should ideally report all secondary outcomes listed in this review, in particular incidence of multiple pregnancy and miscarriage. All rates should be reported per woman, not per cycle, and in actual numbers of participants, not percentages.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-12-08 17:31:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In the 2009 review we widened the inclusion criteria of this review from that of the original protocol (women with anovulation attributed to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)) to include all World Health Organization (WHO) group 2 causes of anovulation, but excluding hyperprolactinaemia. We included trials that were non-specific but appeared to describe PCOS-like anovulation (e.g. women with progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding). Due to the age of many of the trials, particularly for the comparison of clomiphene versus placebo, the most likely cause of anovulation was not fully described. In particular, the currently utilised diagnostic criteria for PCOS were not able to be met. These trials would have been excluded under the criteria of the protocol. We felt that their results were valid and important, and so widened the background and inclusion criteria sections of this review.</P>
<P>In the 2009 review we removed aromatase inhibitor comparisons from this review, as they have been addressed within a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Franik-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franik 2014</LINK>)</P>
<P>In the 2009 review we changed the title from 'Oral anti-oestrogens and medical adjuncts for subfertility associated with anovulation' to 'Clomiphene and antioestrogens for ovulation induction in polycystic ovarian syndrome'.</P>
<P>In the 2016 update we removed as an outcome 'ovulation rate (per woman), where ovulation was defined as evidence of serum progesterone in the luteal range for the reference laboratory or a basal body temperature rise by &gt; 0.4 ºC for 10 days or more as measured by a basal body temperature chart'.</P>
