<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:48:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with cerebral palsy can have problems with sucking, chewing and swallowing. This can make it difficult to eat and lead eventually to undernutrition or problems caused by food going down the wrong way and getting into the lungs. Mealtimes may be long and distressing for the child and for their carer. Increasingly, feeding by a surgically-inserted tube into the stomach (gastrostomy) or via a tube inserted into the middle of the small intestine (jejunostomy) is used to provide such children with nutrition. These processes can be costly, as well as being emotionally difficult for families, and complications are possible. We searched 12 databases in July 2012 but did not find any studies that randomly put children into two groups to investigate the effects of tube feeding via gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) compared to feeding by mouth only. Well-designed studies are needed to help medical professionals and families make difficult decisions about how to treat children with cerebral palsy and physical difficulties in eating.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-30 10:18:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with cerebral palsy can be significantly disabled in terms of their ability to suck, chew and swallow. This can lead to significant impairment in feeding and, eventually, to undernutrition. It can also result in aspiration of food into the lungs. Length of feeding time may be considerably increased and, instead of being an enjoyable experience, mealtimes may be distressing for both child and carer. For children unable to maintain a normal nutritional state feeding by mouth, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are increasingly being used to provide the digestive system with nutrients. A gastrostomy tube is a feeding tube inserted surgically through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach. A jejunostomy feeding tube is inserted into the jejunum, part of the small intestine, either directly or via a previous gastrostomy. Although gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement may greatly facilitate the feeding of children with cerebral palsy, many carers find it very emotionally difficult to accept this intervention. Moreover, the intervention is costly and there is the possibility of complications. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment requires further assessment. This review is an update of one previously published in 2004.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:40:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:40:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-23 15:13:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) can be significantly disabled in terms of their ability to move. This disability may affect not only walking and hand function but also speech and the ability to suck, chew and swallow. This can lead to significant impairment in feeding ability and, eventually, to undernutrition. It can also result in food going down the wrong way (aspiration) and getting into the lungs. Feeding time may be considerably increased and, instead of being an enjoyable experience, mealtimes may be distressing for both the child and the carer. The only alternative, at present, to feeding by mouth is to deliver nutrients by a tube inserted into the stomach. This can be via a tube passed through the nose (nasogastric or 'NG' tube). The NG route is still used for long-term nutritional support in some circumstances but now it is generally recommended that tube feeding via gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) should be considered if non-oral feeding is likely to be required for longer than six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 10:01:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increasingly, for children with cerebral palsy who have very severe difficulties in eating and who are therefore unable to maintain a normal nutritional state feeding by mouth alone, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are being used to provide nutrients (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rempel-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rempel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corwin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darwish-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darwish 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2005</LINK>). A gastrostomy tube is a feeding tube inserted surgically through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach. A jejunostomy feeding tube is inserted into the jejunum (a part of the small intestine), either directly or via a previous gastrostomy. The surgical technique used may vary according to the specific needs of each child. Sometimes it is necessary to open the abdomen to insert the tube and this is usually the case when an additional procedure (a fundoplication) is required to treat vomiting. More commonly, the gastrostomy tube is placed using a fibreoptic endoscope inserted through the mouth and this procedure (a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or 'PEG') avoids open abdominal surgery. Although gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement may greatly facilitate feeding of children with cerebral palsy, many carers find it very difficult to accept this intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Spalding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spalding 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2006</LINK>). Because eating (by mouth) is seen as normal and delivering food to one's child via a hole in the stomach is seen as abnormal, the decision to place a gastrostomy often involves deep emotions for parents (<LINK REF="REF-Thorne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spalding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spalding 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls_x002d_Sleigh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls-Sleigh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gastrostomy is not only used to provide nourishment for children with cerebral palsy; it is used for people of all ages, from infants to the elderly, and for a wide variety of medical conditions. These include situations of rehabilitation where full recovery of eating ability may be anticipated, such as after head injury; and in other extreme situations of terminal care for people with progressive disease where the underlying condition itself carries an increased risk of death. Therefore the underlying medical condition affects the outcome. Children with cerebral palsy have a non-progressive disorder but the physical disability, which results in the eating difficulties, persists. The relevance for children with cerebral palsy of findings from studies that include a majority of adults or a majority of children with disorders other than cerebral palsy is unclear.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:40:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In practice, paediatricians consider use of gastrostomy tube feeding as an intervention for children with neurological impairment even though high quality research on its effects is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Paediatric-Society-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Paediatric Society 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NASPGHAN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASPGHAN 2006</LINK>). Two older systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Samson_x002d_Fang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samson-Fang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleigh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleigh 2004</LINK>), both including observational studies, reported severe methodological weaknesses in the studies they included. They concluded that implications for practice were therefore uncertain. The reviews highlighted specific gaps in knowledge about gastrostomy feeding for children with cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>Most children gain weight (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2005</LINK>) when tube feeding commences, but whether there are other benefits is less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleigh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleigh 2004</LINK>). There are some reports of improved mood and less irritability in children fed by gastrostomy tube following tube insertion (retrospective comparison) (<LINK REF="REF-Sleigh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleigh 2004</LINK>). While gaining weight makes the children look healthier (<LINK REF="REF-Thorne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls_x002d_Sleigh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls-Sleigh 2000</LINK>), however, the increased weight sometimes causes problems with handling and lifting (<LINK REF="REF-Nicholls_x002d_Sleigh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls-Sleigh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1998</LINK>) suggested that the risk of death was increased in children with cerebral palsy who were fed by gastrostomy tube, but other authors, reporting on case series studies, did not find any increased risk of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Plioplys-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plioplys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Fung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2002</LINK>) reported less chest (respiratory) illness in children with cerebral palsy who were fed by gastrostomy compared with children, also severely disabled with cerebral palsy, who took all their nourishment by mouth. <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2006</LINK> reiterated this. A possible explanation is that there was less gastroesophageal reflux (GOR) of acid stomach juices into the lungs following gastrostomy. However, a number of case studies have reported that GOR worsened following gastrostomy feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Heine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heine 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bachrach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachrach 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sulaeman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulaeman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A prospective study reported improved quality of life (using the SF-36 (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1992</LINK>)) for carers of disabled children following their child's gastrostomy (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2002</LINK>), while <LINK REF="REF-Fung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2002</LINK> reported that parental emotional well-being of the parents was lower in families feeding their child by gastrostomy compared with families whose children were fed by mouth. A more recent prospective longitudinal study of tube feeding in neurologically impaired children reported positive impact on the child's health but no improvement in quality of life for parents (<LINK REF="REF-Mahant-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahant 2009</LINK>). Qualitative studies (<LINK REF="REF-Thorne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spalding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spalding 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls_x002d_Sleigh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls-Sleigh 2000</LINK>) have described the emotional turmoil that families frequently undergo when faced with the decision about whether to accept gastrostomy feeding for their child. Qualitative studies have also suggested that the main benefit of gastrostomy for both children and families is the sense that pressure has been taken off oral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Thorne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsley 2000</LINK>); however, new and unexpected problems may arise, such as mothers' reports of feeling less social support and finding it less easy to get out and about (<LINK REF="REF-Brotherson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brotherson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spalding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spalding 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Townsley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsley 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>While no formal economic evaluation has been carried out, gastrostomy feeding is costly: the costs of the operation, provision of equipment, the special commercially prepared 'feeds' and the cost of pre- and post-operative professional support that are required, must be met. In the United Kingdom alone, there may be around 5000 children for whom this treatment is or could be applied (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2002</LINK>). With an estimated cost of between 3000 to 5000 GBP per child per annum, the annual cost of tube feeding disabled children could be between 15 million and 25 million GBP.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-24 14:58:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this review were to assess the beneficial or harmful effects that may occur as a result of gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube feeding for children with cerebral palsy, when compared with oral feeding alone. No randomised controlled trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. This does not imply that there are no benefits or hazards of such treatments, merely that there is no reliable evidence available from which to draw conclusions at present. The review says nothing about the relative risks and benefits of gastrostomy or oral feeding compared with nasogastric (NG) tube feeding. The main reason that NG feeding was not included in this review is that, although the NG route is still used for nutritional support in some circumstances, it is now unusual as a long-term strategy. It is generally recommended that tube feeding via gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) should be considered if non-oral feeding is likely to be required for longer than six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A stronger evidence base is required to guide families and their professional advisers through the difficult decision about feeding via a gastrostomy (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleigh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleigh 2004</LINK>). An RCT to assess both benefits and harms of gastrostomy feeding versus oral feeding alone for children with cerebral palsy is essential.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-04-19 10:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As shown by this systematic review and those of Sleigh and Brocklehurst (<LINK REF="REF-Sleigh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleigh 2004</LINK>) and Samson-Fang et al (<LINK REF="REF-Samson_x002d_Fang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samson-Fang 2003</LINK>), considerable uncertainty about the effects of gastrostomy for children with cerebral palsy remains. This makes it difficult for clinicians to guide parents when faced with the difficult decision about whether to accept or reject the offer of gastrostomy for a child who has cerebral palsy and difficulties with eating. Likewise, there are no reliable sources of information to which parents may be directed in order to find out information for themselves.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-24 15:00:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A well designed and conducted randomised controlled trial of gastrostomy feeding versus oral feeding for children with cerebral palsy should be undertaken to resolve the current uncertainties about medical management for children with cerebral palsy who have physical difficulties with eating. Barriers to such research include the complexity and costs of organising what would necessarily be a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial with power sufficient to detect moderate-sized treatment effects. In the continued absence of such a trial, a future update of this review may incorporate different study designs in order to analyse the available evidence. </P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Data extraction and management</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>It is planned to use paper data collection forms specially devised for use in this review to include information regarding study location, study quality, methods, participant characteristics at baseline (such as age, degree of disability and comorbidities), recruitment period, intervention, length of follow-up, loss to follow-up and outcome measures. The form will be piloted using one or two studies. Data extraction will be performed by two independent review authors for each study and will be scrutinised for disparity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>, section 7.2). Any differences will be resolved by discussion, contacting the authors of the study or independent arbitration as appropriate. Data will be entered into Review Manager software by one review author and checked by another.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of risk of bias</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Included studies will be independently evaluated for risk of bias by two review authors, each of whom will independently assess each study at as high, low or unclear risk of bias using the categories and guidance of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</P>
<P>Low risk of bias indicates that the report gives a clear description of the method used for random allocation and i) the method was adequate to prevent both the person assessing eligibility for trial entry and the participant from knowing what the allocation would be (for example, through allocation by a central office unaware of the subject characteristics, or use of sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); ii) the method was such that after assignment the allocation could not be altered and the decision about eligibility could not be changed.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias indicates uncertainty about whether allocation was adequately concealed, for example the description of the method for allocation was not clearly described in the study report. If the concealment method is unclear, the authors of the study will be contacted to obtain precise information where possible.</P>
<P>High risk of bias indicates that the description of the method for allocation was clearly described but the method was inadequate to guarantee allocation concealment (for example, open random number lists, or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even days of birth or hospital numbers).</P>
<P>
<I>Blinding</I>
</P>
<P>We do not anticipate that blinding to the study intervention for participants (child and family and physician) will ever be possible for this intervention, and blinding is difficult even for the outcome assessor. This is because the intervention is a surgical procedure and the stoma through which the feeds are given and either jejunostomy tube, gastrostomy tube or 'button' (a device at skin level through which feeds are administered) cannot easily be concealed during physical assessment such as weighing. It also involves giving different types of food to the children in the intervention and control groups. The main source of nutrition for the intervention group would usually be commercially prepared 'feeds' whereas the control group would usually be eating ordinary food (even if pureed or commercially prepared baby foods). Thus it would be very difficult for many of the outcomes to guard against performance and detection bias. Use of reliable, valid assessment scales where possible would thus be particularly important (see above under outcome measures). Study quality for this review must therefore be assessed primarily on concealment allocation and analysis using an 'intention to treat' basis. If authors report attempts at assessment blinding this will be discussed.</P>
<P>
<I>Selective outcome reporting</I>
</P>
<P>We will locate the protocols of any included studies to assess whether all outcomes measured have been reported on and the plan for analysis has been followed. </P>
<P>
<I>Incomplete outcome data</I>
</P>
<P>Studies should be able to account for all participants at follow-up. If not clearly reported, an attempt will be made to contact the authors for further information. We will establish whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, that is, on an intention-to-treat basis and on percentage loss to follow-up.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Measures of treatment effect</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Where included studies have measured similar outcomes, we plan to conduct a meta-analysis. For continuous data, and where studies have used the same measure for the outcome, the mean difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. Where a similar outcome has been measured using different instruments, the standardised mean difference with its 95% CI will be calculated, provided it is considered that combining these results makes clinical sense. For dichotomous data, the odds ratio and its 95% CI will be calculated.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Dealing with missing data</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>We will analyse data (where practical) on an intention-to-treat basis. Where insufficient data are reported, trialists will be contacted for further information.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Consistency of results will be assessed visually and by examining I (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), a quantity which describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. This will be supplemented with a test of homogeneity, to determine the strength of evidence that the heterogeneity is genuine. If heterogeneity is suggested by a marked difference of effect shown on the plotted results or if there are differences in the method, population, intervention or outcomes chosen that suggest important heterogeneity, a random-effects model will be used in addition to a fixed-effect model. The possible reasons for heterogeneity will be explored by scrutinising the studies and, where appropriate, performing subgroup analyses.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of reporting biases</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Should sufficient studies be identified in future, funnel plots will be drawn to investigate any relationship between effect size and study precision (closely related to sample size). Such a relationship could be due to publication bias, but may also be due to poor methodological quality of smaller studies or other systematic differences between small and large studies or may occur by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). If a relationship is found, clinical diversity of the studies will be further examined as a possible explanation.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Data synthesis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Assuming two or more studies that are suitable for inclusion are found in future, and assuming also that the study results are similar enough that they can be sensibly grouped together, a meta-analysis will be performed on the results. Both fixed-effect and a random-effects analyses will be performed as part of a sensitivity analysis.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Differences that might influence the effectiveness of gastrostomy feeding compared to oral feeding and that we will explore are:<BR/>*age<BR/>*presence of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or anti-reflux procedure<BR/>*level of disability (including learning disability)<BR/>*environmental factors</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analysis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to determine the impact of risk of bias on outcome if studies of different quality are identified and included (for example, studies whose allocation concealment remains unclear after trying to contact the authors).</P>
