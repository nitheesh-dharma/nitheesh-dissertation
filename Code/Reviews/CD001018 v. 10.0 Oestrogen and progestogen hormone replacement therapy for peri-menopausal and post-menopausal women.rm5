<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Hormone replacement therapy has no effect on body weight and cannot prevent weight gain at menopause.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to reduce the symptoms of menopause and bone loss after menopause. Some women decline to take HRT because they believe it causes weight gain. The review of trials found no evidence that unopposed oestrogen and combined oestrogen and progestogen have an effect on body weight additional to that usually gained at the time of menopause. The review did not find any evidence that HRT prevents weight gain experienced at menopause. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-02-08 10:52:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent post-menopausal bone loss. However, many women are concerned about hormonal replacement therapy because they believe that such treatment will result in weight gain. The effect of HRT on body weight and fat distribution has not yet been examined in systematic reviews. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effect of unopposed oestrogen or combined oestrogen and progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) upon the body weight and fat distribution of peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, Biological Abstracts and CINAHL, most recently in July 2005. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised, placebo or no-treatment controlled trials (RCTs) that detailed the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution. Previous HRT use should have ceased at least one month (in the case of patches, cream or gel) or three months (for oral preparations or subcutaneous pellets) before commencement of the study. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-02-08 10:52:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-eight RCTs with 28,559 women fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. Data was pooled for continuous variables and the weighted mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals reported.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Outcomes were evaluated separately for unopposed oestrogen and oestrogen combined with progestogen regimens. No statistically significant difference was found in mean weight gain between those using unopposed oestrogen and non-HRT users (0.03kg, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.67) and those using oestrogen with progestogen therapy and non-HRT users (0.04 kg, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.50). There was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI) between women using unopposed oestrogen and non-HRT users (-0.14, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.12) or oestrogen combined with progestogen and non-HRT users (-0.10, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.07). Insufficient data were available to enable meta-analysis of the effect of HRT on waist to hip ratio, fat mass or skinfold thickness. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence of an effect of unopposed oestrogen or combined oestrogen with progestogen on body weight and on the BMI increase normally experienced at the time of menopause. Insufficient evidence currently exists to enable examination of the effect of HRT on waist-hip ratio, fat mass or skinfold thickness. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-30 10:37:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent post-menopausal bone loss (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-and-Purdie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees and Purdie 2006</LINK>).

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-30 10:53:16 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence suggests that women increase in body weight with age, and this tends to begin at or near menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>). Additionally, body fat distribution changes with age, independent of weight gain, and these changes begin around the time of the menopause. There is an increase in body fat as a percentage of body weight and a redistribution of body fat with a relative increase in the proportion of abdominal fat (<LINK REF="REF-Tchernof-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tchernof 2000</LINK>). This centralised abdominal (android) fat distribution is recognised as an independent predictor of (or risk factor for) cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-30 10:53:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contrary to the widely held belief of increasing body weight, HRT may in fact prevent or at least limit an increase in the body fat of menopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassager-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassager 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>) and resist the redistribution of body fat so that a more gynaecoid, or pear-shaped, appearance is maintained (<LINK REF="STD-Haarbo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haarbo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gambacciani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gambacciani 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arabi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arabi 2003</LINK>). These effects may depend upon the mode of administration of HRT (<LINK REF="REF-Hanggi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanggi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Sullivan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Sullivan 1998</LINK>), in the same manner as are apparent for symptomatic and metabolic differences (for example, in lipids and lipoproteins) (<LINK REF="REF-Godsland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godsland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review is an update of a previous systematic review prepared in 1999. It is an important topic since some women decline oestrogen therapy due to their concerns about resultant weight gain and thus forego its potential therapeutic benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Baglia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baglia 2004</LINK>). Despite its benefits, HRT has been found to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-MWS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MWS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. To assess the likelihood of weight gain associated with hormone replacement therapy in peri-menopausal and menopausal women. <BR/>2. To assess the likelihood of a redistribution of body fat from the hips and thighs (gynaecoid) to the abdomen (android) associated with hormone replacement therapy in peri-menopausal and menopausal women. </P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>A trial was considered for inclusion if it detailed the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution, even if its main focus was on another outcome of HRT, for example change in the risk of osteoporosis. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-11-30 10:53:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women of any ethnicity who are either peri-menopausal or post-menopausal.</P>
<P>Peri-menopausal women are defined as those aged 45 years or more, or who have elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and who have menstruated intermittently within the last 12 months. Post-menopausal women are defined as those aged 45 years or more and who have not menstruated for more than 12 months. Also defined as menopausal are women of any age who have had menopause artificially induced by bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries) and whose oophorectomy took place at least one month before entry into a trial.</P>
<P>RCTs of women with pre-existing major disease have been excluded from consideration as are those studies where previous HRT was discontinued less than one month (in the case of patches, cream or gel) or three months (in the case or oral preparations or subcutaneous pellets) before commencement of the study.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All oestrogens with and without progestogens given as peri- or post-menopausal therapy versus placebo or no treatment for the control of menopausal symptoms. HRT is defined as unopposed oestrogen therapy (E) or oestrogen therapy with combined, cyclic or continuous progestogen therapy (E+P). Studies that combined HRT with another complementary therapy, such as vitamin or mineral supplementation or diet were included for consideration. The minimum period of treatment was three months with no upper limit to the period of treatment. Where answers to criteria for consideration were not readily available from a paper, first authors were contacted for further information. Other aspects of the intervention that were considered in relation to weight and body fat distribution change were dosage and length of the treatment follow-up period. </P>

<BR/>1. Outcomes relevant to this analysis, that is body weight, BMI, waist to hip ratio, skinfold measurements and body fat mass.<BR/>2. Primary outcomes of the trial which may have differed from the outcomes relevant to this analysis.<BR/>Three of the review authors (RJN, MR and EJK) are experienced in clinical issues. Additional information on trial methodology and actual original trial data were sought from the principal author of any trials that appeared to meet the eligibility criteria, where necessary. A number of requests for additional information are currently outstanding. As most of these requests are for endpoint body weight details, it has not been possible to include the studies in the analysis at this time. Details and subsequent eligible trials will be included in updates to this review, as responses are received.<BR/>This review includes eligible trials located as at July 2005. Study selection and assessment of methodological quality took place between July and December 2005, extraction of data and analysis were performed between January and February 2006 and the update was written between March and May 2006.<BR/>Results from trials that used E and those that used E+P have been separately analysed. Those trials that had two or more treatment arms consisting of differing dosages of E or E+P respectively had their results combined for an analysis of results arising from any dosage. Dosages were also broken down for analysis into low, medium and high-dose categories and equivalences based on moderate doses as follows.</P>

<I>Moderate dosages:</I>

<BR/>conjugated oestrogen: 0.625 mg to 1.25 mg;<BR/>17 beta estradiol: 1.0 mg to 2.0 mg;<BR/>micronized estradiol: 1.0 mg to 2.0 mg;<BR/>estradiol valerate: 1.0 mg to 2.0 mg;<BR/>transdermal estradiol: 50 µgm;<BR/>ethinyl estradiol: 15 µgm to 20 µgm.</P>

<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. RCTs that examined E and those that examined E+P were analysed separately. Six RCTs included both types of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Espeland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Espeland 1997</LINK>). As mentioned above, the Eplus P treatment arm of <LINK REF="STD-Espeland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Espeland 1997</LINK> has not been included in this analysis pending receipt of additional information from the researchers. Similarly, the E plus P treatment phase of <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987d</LINK> was not included in the analysis because of the absence of a washout period. One study included dietary therapy in the treatment (E+P) and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 1995</LINK>).<BR/>For all trials, duration of treatment ranged from three months to 96 months, with the majority of studies (10) being for 12 months. Except for <LINK REF="STD-Khoo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Khoo 1998</LINK> which specifically examined the effects of HRT on peri-menopausal women, all trials stated that their women were post-menopausal. However, seven studies, which did not report biochemical confirmation of post-menopausal status, included participants who had their last menstrual bleeding within a year of the trial; and thus some of these women may in fact have been peri-menopausal. In particular, the (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>), which was the largest unopposed oestrogen trial, considered prior hysterectomy to be equivalent to menopause whereas some women could have hysterectomy without oophorectomy (removal of ovaries).<BR/>No data were available for the outcomes skinfold thickness and body fat mass for any dose of E treatment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Haarbo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haarbo 1991</LINK>) that examined E plus P treatment provided data on fat mass but no study on E plus P had data on skinfold thickness. <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> provided body fat mass details for E plus P but these were not in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis because the effects reflected within person variation and were estimated by linear regression. Data were available for the outcomes: weight, BMI and waist to hip ratio for moderate doses of E or E plus P; weight was the only outcome to have data available for low and high dosages of E and E plus P.</P>
<P>
<I>Unopposed oestrogen studies </I>
<BR/>Nine RCTs of E versus placebo or no therapy, with a total of 10,194 women, were included in the review. The largest of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>) provided follow up for up to nine years but we included only the data recorded at the end of the fourth year because of the high proportion of missing data after this time. One trial comparing treatment with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lindheim-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindheim 1994</LINK>) has an outstanding query on endpoint data for one of the treatment arms, which combined HRT with exercise.<BR/>All of the trials provided baseline body weight details. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Espeland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Espeland 1997</LINK>) also provided baseline BMI and waist to hip ratio details. No trial reported on body fat mass or skinfold thickness outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Espeland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Espeland 1997</LINK> was the only trial that specifically addressed body weight and waist and hip girths; the others had lipid profiles, climacteric symptoms, bone density and muscle performance as primary outcomes.<BR/>Seven trials used an oral route of administration. Some women in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>) had their treatment administered via a gel. Results for these women and the remainder of the treatment group, receiving oral E, were combined for analysis by the researchers. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987d</LINK>), treatment was administered via a cream. One other study (<LINK REF="STD-Good-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Good 1996</LINK>) administered treatment via a patch. This study did not entirely comply with the protocol inclusion criteria in that the researchers required their participants to have discontinued oral hormone replacement therapy up to six weeks before the study followed by a two-week therapy-free screening period. Our protocol states that women should have discontinued oral therapy at least three months before entering a study. The numbers of women who had ceased oral E between three months and six weeks prior to study entry is unknown. Sensitivity analysis was performed with and without the inclusion of this study.<BR/>Seven of the trials used a moderate dosage of HRT, as defined earlier. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>) exclusively used a low, synthetic oestrogen dosage. <LINK REF="STD-Good-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Good 1996</LINK> had a high dosage treatment arm and a moderate dosage treatment arm, while <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987d</LINK> had a high dosage administered via a cream.<BR/>The no treatment control group in <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK> was given calcium plus parasympatholytics (drugs to ameliorate menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes) as needed. All treatment groups in two studies were supplemented with calcium (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>) and in another trial women were given calcium supplementation "if necessary" (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Combined oestrogen and progestogen studies </I>
<BR/>Twenty-three RCTs of E+P versus placebo or no therapy with a total of 18,365 participants were included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK> was the largest trial and alone contributed 13,204 participants. Although the study started with 16,608 participants, data on body weight and BMI were only available for 431 by the end of the trial, which took eight years. We therefore chose to analyse data after the fourth year when data on 13,204 participants were available. The second largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kanaya-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kanaya 2003</LINK>) contributed 2,763 participants to the analysis. For two of the trials on E+P treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987a</LINK>), we were able to extract high-dosage details but data for the combined dosages and other dosage levels is awaiting further information from the first author. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Myrup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Myrup 1992</LINK>) has an outstanding query for endpoint data on one of the treatment arms, which was combined with cholecalciferol. <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> (58 participants) is not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Seventeen out of 23 trials provided baseline body weight details. Other relevant baseline measures were BMI (12 trials), waist to hip ratio (one trial), abdominal skinfold thickness (one trial) and body fat mass (two trials). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haarbo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haarbo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Khoo 1998</LINK>) specifically addressed the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution measures. The remainder had lipid profiles, plasma homocysteine (elevated levels of this amino acid are associated with cardiovascular disease), bone density, endometrial effects, procoagulant (mediating the coagulation of blood) and inhibiting factors of haemostatic balance (successful blood clotting), coronary heart disease, invasive breast cancer and muscle performance as primary outcomes.</P>
<P>All trials had used an oral route of administration except for three: <LINK REF="STD-Writing-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Writing 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Jaraiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Jaraiz 1996</LINK> administered treatment via a patch and <LINK REF="STD-Wimalawansa-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wimalawansa 1995</LINK> administered treatment via a gel.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Khoo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Khoo 1998</LINK> has not entirely complied with the protocol in that some women (three out of 105 randomised) were on HRT up to one month prior to randomisation. To comply with the protocol, those taking oral HRT should have ceased therapy at least three months before randomisation. It is not possible to ascertain whether these women were using oral, patch or pellet regimens, or whether they were part of the withdrawals from the study (there was no-intention-to-treat analysis). Sensitivity analysis was performed with and without the inclusion of this study.</P>
<P>Twenty of the 23 included trials used a moderate dosage, as described earlier. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>) used a low dosage exclusively. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987a</LINK> compared a high dosage to a moderate dosage; these studies are currently only able to have high dosage details extracted pending further information from the first author.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK> gave women supplements of calcium "if necessary".

<I>Unopposed oestrogen: results overview </I>
<BR/>Sufficient data are currently available to enable a meta-analysis of the effect of unopposed oestrogen on body weight and BMI. The result indicates that the use of unopposed oestrogen has no significant effect on weight gain compared to women not on HRT (MD 0.03 kg, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.67). Similarly, there was no significant difference in BMI between women using unopposed oestrogen and non-HRT users (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.12). Insufficient data were available for meta-analysis of waist to hip ratio, and no data were available for analysis of body fat mass or skinfold thickness.</P>
<P>
<I>Unopposed oestrogen: weight </I>
<BR/>Nine RCTs with a total of 10,194 participants provided weight data. All studies included in this meta-analysis showed that women using E gained an average of 0.03 kg compared to those women not using HRT. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups (95% CI 0.61 to 0.67). The same trend was apparent when sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding studies that had B and C allocation scores; although the mean weight gain for those on E was greater than those who were not, the confidence intervals indicated that the results were not statistically significant. Sensitivity analyses excluding no treatment studies and the one study not comparable for weight at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>) made no difference to this trend; nor did the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Good-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Good 1996</LINK>, which had not entirely complied with the review protocol.<BR/>All individual studies bar one had statistically insignificant results. <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK> found that women on E gained an average of 2.02 kg more than those not on HRT, a borderline significant result (CI 0.003 to 4.04). This study is the only one included in the meta-analysis which used a synthetic hormone, ethinyl estradiol. Sensitivity analysis performed with this trial excluded from the meta-analysis resulted in women taking E losing an average of 0.20 kg less than those not using HRT, but this is not statistically significant (95% CI -0.87 to 0.48).<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were also performed excluding those studies with a withdrawal or loss to follow up rate of at least 10% and no-intention-to-treat analysis. Four studies were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987d" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>).

<P>
<I>Unopposed oestrogen: dosage categories </I>

When the two studies with high dosage levels were combined, there was similarly no significant difference in mean weight increase between the two groups of women (MD 0.89 kg, 95% CI -1.75 to 3.54). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Espeland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Espeland 1997</LINK>) contributed data to the BMI and waist to hip ratios in the medium dosage category, with non significant findings, but additional data are needed to enable a meta-analysis.

<BR/>Sufficient data were available to enable a meta-analysis of the effect of an E+P regimen on body weight and BMI. Results indicated that the use of the combined regimen of E+P had no significant effect on mean weight gain, compared to women not using HRT (MD 0.04 kg, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.50). The meta-analysis also indicated that a combined E+P regimen had no significant effect on mean BMI increase, compared to not using HRT (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.07). Insufficient data existed to enable meta-analysis of waist to hip measurements and skinfold thickness (one study only). Body fat mass results were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> who found that the percent of body fat increased in both treatment and placebo groups, with the greatest increase in the E+P group although this was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<I>Combined oestrogen plus progestogen (E+P): body weight </I>
<BR/>Thirteen RCTs with a total of 18,365 women provided body weight data, although <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> has been excluded from the meta-analysis (58 women). Combined dosage data could not be extracted from an additional two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987a</LINK>) pending further information from the first author. These studies are, therefore, excluded from the following presentation of results.<BR/>The meta-analysis indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in mean weight gain for those taking E+P and women not taking HRT (MD 0.04 kg, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.50). Exclusion of studies with a B and C allocation scores did not change this trend (MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.52). A sensitivity analysis excluding no treatment trials did not show any significant difference in mean weight gain between groups (MD 0.02 kg, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.48). The exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Khoo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Khoo 1998</LINK>, because the study had not entirely complied with the review protocol and participants were frankly peri-menopausal, made no difference to this result. Exclusion of the two studies where groups were unbalanced for weight at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>) resulted in no difference in mean weight gain (0.002 kg) between E+P and non-HRT users.<BR/>All individual studies bar three had results that were not statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK> showed that women using E+P gained, on average, significantly less weight than non-HRT users (MD -7.01 kg, 95% CI -13.45 to -0.56). However, there was a statistically significant difference in baseline weight parameters at the P = 0.05 level between treatment groups, with the HRT treatment group being heavier than the non-HRT group. The loss to follow up for this study was also high (&gt; 20%). <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> reported a statistically significant increase in body weight in those women using E+P compared to women who were not. This result was estimated by logistic regression. <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK> reported an almost statistically significant mean weight gain of 1.86 kg for E+P users compared to non-HRT users (95% CI -0.17 to 3.89). As mentioned earlier in the presentation of unopposed oestrogen results, this is the only study included in the meta-analysis that used synthetic oestrogen in the HRT treatment regimen. Sensitivity analyses performed with <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK> excluded again indicated no significant difference in mean weight gain between E+P and non-HRT users (MD 0.02 kg, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.45).<BR/>A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding those studies (nine out of thirteen) with a withdrawal or loss to follow up rate more than 10% and no-intention-to-treat analysis. The result showed no statistical difference in mean weight gain between E+P users and non-HRT users (MD -0.10 kg, 95% CI -1.01 to 0.80).<BR/>As with the unopposed E trials, further sensitivity analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether trials with a duration of 12 months or longer resulted in any difference in body weight gain between E+P and non-HRT users. Eight trials were excluded leaving five trials with durations of 24 (two trials), 30 (one trial) and 48 (two trials) months in the analysis. The results continued to show no significant difference in mean weight gain (MD 0.26 kg, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.76).</P>
<P>
<I>Combined oestrogen plus progestogen: BMI </I>
<BR/>Ten RCTs with a total of 17,728 women provided BMI data. The meta-analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in mean BMI gain between E+P users and those women not taking HRT (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.07). Exclusion of the one study with a C random allocation and exclusion of HRT treatment versus no treatment trials did not change this result.<BR/>Nine studies had withdrawals of more than 10% and no intention-to-treat analysis. When they were excluded, in a sensitivity analysis, women not taking HRT continued to show a non significant mean increase in BMI compared with women taking E+P. Nine out of the ten trials included in the BMI outcome did not have an intention-to-treat analysis.<BR/>Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether exclusion of trials with a duration of 12 months or less resulted in any significant difference between the groups with regard to increase in BMI. Four trials were excluded, leaving six trials with durations of 15 (one trial), 30 (one trial), and 48 (four trials) months in the analysis. The analysis indicated no significant difference between E+P and non-HRT users (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.10).<BR/>Combined oestrogen plus progestogen: waist to hip measurements and abdominal skinfold thickness<BR/>It is currently not possible to perform a meta-analysis on these outcomes as only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 1995</LINK>) measured the waist to hip ratio and one (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>) the abdominal skinfold thickness. Both studies had A randomisation allocation scores but small participant numbers. Neither study found any statistically significant difference between women taking HRT and those not taking HRT.<BR/>Combined oestrogen plus progestogen: body fat massIt was not possible to perform a meta-analysis on this outcome as there was only study (<LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK>). In any case, this data could not be included in the meta-analysis because the effects were estimated by linear regression and precise means and standard deviations were not available. The researchers found that the percent of body fat increased from baseline measurements in both the E+P and placebo groups, with the greatest increase in the E+P group although this was not statistically significant.<BR/>Combined oestrogen plus progestogen: dosage categoriesBody weight was the only outcome that had data available in the low dosage category. Two studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>) and results indicated a statistically non significant increase in mean weight for women on low dosage E+P compared to women not using HRT (MD 1.71 kg, 95% CI -0.27 to 3.70). The two studies contributing data on body weight in the high dosage category (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987a</LINK>) are awaiting additional information requested from the first author. They showed that E+P users did not, on average, gain as much weight as non-HRT users (MD -0.41kg, 95% CI -3.78 to 2.95) but this result was not significant.</P>
<P>The majority of studies (10 trials) contributed data towards the body weight outcome in the moderate dosage category. Meta-analysis indicated no significant difference in mean weight for women not using HRT compared to those using medium dosage E+P (MD -0.08 kg, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.39). Sensitivity analysis was performed with two studies excluded due to the significant difference in baseline weight parameters between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>). Meta-analysis again indicated no significant difference in mean body weight between E+P users and non-HRT users (MD 0.00 kg, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.47). <LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK> found a statistically significant weight increase in HRT users compared to non-users, but this result was not available in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis.<BR/>All studies that provided information on the effect of HRT on BMI were in the moderate dosage category. Results have been discussed previously.</P>
<P>Other outcomes are in the medium dosage category of waist to hip ratio, skinfold thickness and body fat mass. However, only one study was included in each (<LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 1995</LINK>) and all have statistically non significant findings.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-30 11:12:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed the effect of unopposed oestrogen and oestrogen combined with progestogen on a number of weight and fat distribution outcomes when administered to peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women. The two outcomes that currently have sufficient data to enable meaningful meta-analysis are body weight and BMI. The inclusion of the Women's Health Initiative trials (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>) markedly raised the number of participants giving sufficient power to determine the effect of HRT on body weight and BMI.</P>
<P>In summary, most of the studies identified showed no statistically significant difference in mean weight or BMI gain between menopausal HRT users and non-users. Those that did had groups that were not comparable for relevant outcomes at baseline, used synthetic oestrogen within the contraceptive range or had their results estimated by logistic regression. Meta-analysis of eligible trials has indicated no difference in mean weight or BMI gain between unopposed or combined oestrogen therapy users and non-users, and this result is reflected in sensitivity analyses. This finding strongly suggests that there is no evidence of an effect of HRT on body weight and, just as strongly, suggests that there is no evidence of a preventive effect of HRT on the weight gain normally experienced at menopause.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-11-30 11:15:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although meta-analysis may have shown a positive trend to gain for women with and without HRT, depending on the category and outcome, almost none of the results were statistically significant. This finding held when placebo controlled and no treatment trials were combined and when placebo controlled trials were analysed separately. The result also persists when trials with a range of randomisation quality scores are combined and when those with A randomisation scores are analysed separately. The one outcome that indicated a significant difference in weight gain between non-users and users (E+P, moderate dosage category) showed no difference when trials with treatment groups that were not comparable at baseline were excluded. One other trial showed a significant gain for E+P users compared to non-users (<LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK>); unfortunately this trial contained data in a form that could not be entered into the meta-analysis but clearly this result does not support the conclusion of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Overall, meta-analysis strongly suggests that there is no evidence of an effect of unopposed oestrogen or combined oestrogen and progestogen therapy on body weight. Two unopposed oestrogen trials provided data on BMI. The meta-analysis of these studies as well as studies with combined oestrogen plus progestogen therapy indicate the same finding, that is that there is no evidence of an effect of combined hormonal therapy on BMI.<BR/>The result of this meta-analysis also strongly suggests that there is no evidence of a preventive effect of HRT on weight gain or increase in BMI associated with the menopause. Currently, insufficient evidence exists to examine the effect of HRT on waist to hip ratio, body fat mass or skinfold measurement. Consequently, the review authors were unable to address objective two of this review, to assess the likelihood of a redistribution of body fat from the hips and thighs to the abdomen associated with HRT. This objective may be more effectively investigated through a separate meta-analysis of studies which compare one mode of administration against another given recent research which has found that the route of HRT therapy has an effect on fat mass and lean body mass (<LINK REF="REF-Hanggi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanggi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Sullivan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Sullivan 1998</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-11-30 11:14:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Almost all of the 28 trials included in this analysis individually indicated a non significant effect of HRT on body weight parameters. Of the two trials included in the meta-analysis that individually found a significant effect, one had groups that were unbalanced at baseline for weight (<LINK REF="STD-Limpaphayom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Limpaphayom 1996</LINK>) and the other was the only trial that used synthetic oestrogen (<LINK REF="STD-Speroff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speroff 1996</LINK>). The third study estimated the effects of HRT on body weight by the use of logistic regression (<LINK REF="STD-Aloia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aloia 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was not possible to produce meaningful results for all dosage levels. Results for the moderate dosage level basically reflect the findings of the combined (any dose) categories, not surprisingly given that the majority of studies used a moderate dosage. Meta-analysis of a moderate dosage of E+P did not reach statistical significance for both body weight and BMI. Similarly, none of the categories bar one reached statistical significance. The category of low dosage of E with one trial using synthetic oestrogen reported a borderline statistically significant weight gain for women using HRT compared to non-users.<BR/>A large number of studies are still awaiting further information from the first authors and it may appear that a substantial amount of data are missing from the review. However, very few of these RCTs have the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution as a primary outcome. Because most studies are addressing other HRT factors, a number of correspondents may well inform the review authors that relevant (for the purposes of this review) endpoint data do not exist.</P>
<P>There are a number of limitations to the results of this analysis that should be borne in mind. Because the likelihood exists that a large number of RCTs using HRT as treatment will contain baseline body weight details, the search strategy by necessity has to be sensitive rather than specific, resulting in a large number of possibly relevant trials being located on electronic databases. In many instances the searchers (IF and EK) had to deduce from the abstracts whether relevant details were likely to be included in the paper before obtaining the complete article. These abstracts were scrutinised very carefully but some possibly relevant trials may have been overlooked. The review authors believe that this possibility has been kept to a minimum by searching citation lists of included trials, conference abstracts and review articles for details of relevant original research.<BR/>There exists the likelihood of some additional omission of information due to the disappointing lack of response by pharmaceutical companies to the request by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group to provide details of in-house randomised controlled trials. It is likely that there have been trials conducted for registration purposes that have not been published. Certainly, Internet web sites such as Centerwatch (http://www.centerwatch.com) contain details of numerous trials concerning HRT for which participants are being recruited, and in all probability a number of these trials are being sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.<BR/>Comparatively few of the studies included in this analysis or awaiting assessment specifically address the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution. This has meant that, for most studies, relevant baseline parameters of activity, dietary, smoking habits and type of menopause have not been controlled for or recorded.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-11-30 11:15:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the majority of the trials were placebo controlled and blinded, the presence or absence of bleeding might have led to unbinding of participants. Level of participation in some trials was checked by counting tablets at each visit but nevertheless lack of blinding to treatment may have led to some bias. The fact that the majority of studies included in the meta-analysis (18 out of 26) were not analysed on an-intention-to-treat basis (including four out of the five trials that specifically addressed body weight distribution factors) and a number of placebo controlled studies (10) had withdrawals or losses to follow up of more than 15%, may also have led to some bias.<BR/>The maximum duration of the trials included in this analysis is four years and so the possibility exists that HRT may, over the longer term, either cause or minimise additional weight gain to that normally experienced after menopause. One of the placebo controlled trials awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Nachtigall-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nachtigall 1979</LINK>) followed 168 women over ten years, and found that women had identical weight gain after ten years regardless of whether they had received oestrogen or placebo. This trial cannot be included in the meta-analysis until additional endpoint data have been received from the first author. A long-term observational trial had the same finding. <LINK REF="REF-Kritz_x002d_Silverstein-96" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kritz-Silverstein 96</LINK> followed up a group of 671 women 15 years after they had originally been enrolled in the Rancho Bernardo study and found that HRT, whether used intermittently or continuously for 15 or more years, neither explained nor prevented the weight gain and central obesity commonly observed in post-menopausal women. Similarly, the end-of-trial data following eight years of follow up in the Women's Health Initiative trials (<LINK REF="STD-WHI-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHI-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WHI 2004</LINK>) showed that there was no difference in weight gain and BMI between the HRT user and non-users. We decided to include only data recorded in the fourth year of these trials because after that year a high proportion of women did not have their weight and BMI recorded. The Women Health Initiative Study reported an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer in women taking HRT. Following these findings, long-term use of HRT has declined and HRT is now limited to short-term use for menopausal symptoms.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Luoto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luoto 1998</LINK> hypothesised that those women who have undergone surgical menopause may gain special benefits from HRT use if they are already overweight. Five of the nine unopposed oestrogen trials described in this analysis included women with natural menopause, thereby making it difficult to perceive any relationship between weight, hysterectomy and hormone use.<BR/>Perception of weight gain may be due to the altered fat distribution that tends to occur at menopause. Studies which have examined the effect of differing modes of administration of HRT on body fat mass and lean body mass have not included a randomly selected placebo group and there have been too few placebo controlled trials addressing this aspect. As <LINK REF="REF-Burger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 1998</LINK> has pointed out, definitive studies of the effect of HRT on body weight should include measurement of fat distribution in addition to total weight.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 13:32:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials that the use of either unopposed oestrogen or combined oestrogen plus progestogen therapy causes extra weight gain in addition to that normally gained at the time of menopause. There is evidence from one trial that synthetic oestrogen does cause extra weight gain compared to not using HRT. </P>
<P>Additionally, meta-analysis has found no evidence that the use of HRT actually prevents the weight gain normally experienced at menopause. There is insufficient evidence available from randomised studies to be able to ascertain whether HRT use prevents or at least limits the menopausal tendency towards redistribution of body fat from a pear shape to an apple shape. It should be noted, however, that few randomised trials have specifically addressed the issue of the effect of HRT on body weight or fat distribution, and trials that have had a different primary research outcome may not have properly controlled for relevant parameters such as diet, physical activity and smoking habits. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-10 13:32:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>To date, few randomised trials have focused on the influence of HRT on body weight with proper control for relevant parameters. Future trials should ensure baseline equality of lifestyle parameters and control for socio demographic and lifestyle characteristics. They should also be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.<BR/>Studies of the effect of HRT on body weight should include measurement of fat distribution in addition to total weight. Further research is also needed to address the effect of HRT on body weight and fat distribution in women who have surgical menopause.<BR/>The results of the one trial using synthetic oestrogen indicated a statistically significant weight gain for those women using HRT compared to non-users. This trial used low doses of ethinyl oestradiol, which were in the contraceptive range. Placebo controlled trials using this form of HRT and controlling for relevant body weight parameters could help elucidate whether the use of synthetic oestrogen does tend to increase weight gain in post-menopausal women.<BR/>As mentioned earlier, there were insufficient data to enable any findings on whether HRT prevented or limited the redistribution of fat to a more android shape, because few placebo-controlled trials have addressed this aspect. Such investigation may be more effectively investigated through a separate meta-analysis of studies which compare one mode of administration against another given that some researchers have found that there is a differential impact on body fat distribution.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomisation achieved by a computer-generated random number table to produce balanced blocks of participant numbers within each centre. A 1:1:1 treatment allocation was used.<BR/>Number of centres: 8.<BR/>Design: Parallel, placebo-controlled.<BR/>Blinding: designed to be double-blind, although the placebo group became unblinded due to lack of bleeding. Laboratory staff were kept blind.<BR/>No. of women randomised: 255.<BR/>No. of women analysed: 188.<BR/>No intention-to-treat analysis.<BR/>Withdrawals and losses to follow up: 67 discontinued the study early, mainly because of poor participant levels (n = 19) or adverse reactions (n = 19; skin irritation at patch application site (8), breast tenderness (5), abnormal bleeding (3), abdominal pain and weight gain (2), low back pain (1). Other reasons for discontinuance were unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (5), withdrawal of consent (10), and loss to follow-up (14).<BR/>Power calculation performed.<BR/>Source of funding: No source of funding stated.<BR/>
