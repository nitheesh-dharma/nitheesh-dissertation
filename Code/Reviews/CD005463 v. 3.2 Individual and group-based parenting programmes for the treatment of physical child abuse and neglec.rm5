<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Physical abuse and neglect of children are significant problems and changing parenting practices may be an important means of addressing them. This review examines the extent to which parenting programmes (relatively brief and structured interventions that are aimed at changing parenting practices) are effective in treating physically abusive or neglectful parenting. A total of seven studies of mixed quality were included in the review. The findings show that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of parenting programmes to reduce physical abuse or neglect (i.e. using objective assessments of abuse such as reports of child abuse; children on the children protection register etc). There is, however, limited evidence to show that some parenting programmes may be effective in improving some outcomes that are <I>associated</I> with physically abusive parenting. There is an urgent need for further rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of parenting programmes that are specifically designed to treat physical abuse and neglect, either independently or as part of broader packages of care. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Child physical abuse and neglect are important public health problems for which there are currently few effective treatments. Many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect are not amenable to change in the short term. Intervening to change parenting practices may, however, be important in its treatment. Parenting programmes are focused, short-term interventions aimed at improving parenting practices, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of physically abusive or neglectful parenting.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of group-based or one-to-one parenting programmes in addressing child physical abuse or neglect. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A range of biomedical and social science databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Sociofile, Social Science Citation Index, ASSIA, the Cochrane Library, Campbell Library (including SPECTR and CENTRAL), National Research Register (NRR) and ERIC, from inception to May 2005.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials or randomised studies evaluating the effectiveness of standardised group-based or one-to-one parenting programmes aimed at the treatment of physical child abuse or neglect were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The results for each outcome in each study have been presented, with 95% confidence intervals. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of seven studies of variable quality were included in this review. Only three studies assessed the effectiveness of parenting programmes on objective measures of abuse (e.g. the incidence of child abuse, number of injuries, or reported physical abuse), and only one of these found significant differences between the intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Data were also extracted on over fifty outcomes that are used as predictive measures of abusive parenting. These measured a range of aspects of parenting (e.g. parental child management, discipline practices, child abuse potential and mental health), child health (e.g. emotional and behavioural adjustment) and family functioning, thereby precluding the possibility of undertaking a meta-analysis for most outcomes for which data were extracted. While none of the programmes were effective across all of the outcomes measured, many appeared to have improved some outcomes for some of the participating parents, although many failed to achieve statistical significance. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of parenting programmes to treat physical abuse or neglect. There is, however, limited evidence to show that some parenting programmes may be effective in improving some outcomes that are associated with physically abusive parenting. Further research is urgently needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-24 16:23:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Child physical abuse and neglect are important public health problems. A recent UK population-based survey showed that 6% of individuals aged 18-33 years had been subject to serious physical neglect at home and 7% had suffered serious physical abuse at the hands of a parent or carer (<LINK REF="REF-Brooker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooker 2001</LINK>). Child maltreatment is one of the most serious events undermining healthy psychological development, and no other social risk factor has a stronger association with developmental psychopathology (<LINK REF="REF-Brooker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooker 2001</LINK>). The negative sequelae have been documented across a range of domains including cognition, language, learning, socio-emotional development, mental and physical health (<LINK REF="REF-Cicchetti-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicchetti 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect are either not amenable to change in the short term (i.e. maternal youth, parental history of abuse) or insufficiently specific to represent an efficient target for intervention (e.g. single parents, frequent relocation) (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1997</LINK>). Many of targets are also not amenable to interventions that can be delivered by health, education or social services. Parenting attitudes, beliefs, and practices, which are significant in the aetiology of child maltreatment are, however, amenable to such intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Trickett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trickett 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pianta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pianta 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1978</LINK>). Maltreating and abusive parents are less positive, supportive and nurturing of their children, and more negative, hostile, and punitive than non-maltreating parents (<LINK REF="REF-Pianta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pianta 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1978</LINK>). They also react more negatively to ordinary parental challenges such as a crying infant (<LINK REF="REF-Frodi-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frodi 1980</LINK>), frequently have inappropriate expectations of the child, an inability to be empathically aware of the child's needs, a strong belief in the value of punishment (which can be haphazard, uncontrolled and often represents an impulsive discharge of aggression on the part of the parent), and significant role reversal in which the parent looks to the child for the satisfaction of their own emotional needs (<LINK REF="REF-Bavolek-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bavolek 1989</LINK>). There is also some intergenerational continuity in parenting problems of this nature (around 30%) (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-27 13:00:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The parenting programmes that are the focus of this review are short-term interventions aimed at improving the quality of the parent-child relationship by changing parenting practices, aspects of parental functioning such as mental health, attributions and cognitions, the child's emotional and behavioural adjustment, and family functioning more generally. Parenting programmes are now being offered in a variety of settings, and a number of recent systematic reviews suggest that they are moderately effective in the short term in improving maternal psychosocial health (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2002a</LINK>), and the emotional and behavioural adjustment of infants and toddlers (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2005</LINK>), and older children (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2000b</LINK>). There is also evidence to suggest that they are effective in improving outcomes for both teenage mothers and their children (<LINK REF="REF-Coren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coren 2001</LINK>). A recent review of parenting programmes by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence indicated that parenting programmes are cost effective in the treatment of conduct disorder (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-24 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of the effectiveness of both group-based and individual parenting programmes in reducing abuse and neglect is needed for a number of reasons. First, although there have been a number of reviews conducted addressing the effectiveness of family-based interventions in reducing child abuse (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Edgeworth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgeworth 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oates-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Werkele-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werkele 1993</LINK>; Wolfe 1993), none of these have focused solely on parenting programmes, some were narrative reviews only, and all were limited in terms of the databases that were searched. Second, there is debate as to whether standard parenting programmes alone i.e. without additional components to address risk factors such as parental anger and stress or parental constructions and attributions, are sufficiently effective to address child abuse and neglect with parents who have a history of such abuse (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1997</LINK>). There is a need to explore the types of parenting programmes that are currently being used to treat such parenting, and to identify the core components necessary for a successful outcome. Third, a recent systematic review of the evidence suggests that parenting programmes maybe cost-effective methods of intervening with families (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). However, the majority of families with children on the child protection register do not currently receive any formal intervention to either improve their parenting skills or to protect the child (other than the removal of the child from the home). This situation may reflect the paucity of evidence concerning both effective interventions generally, and the benefits of parenting programmes for high-risk groups of parents more specifically, in addition to financial constraints. A systematic review may therefore provide the research basis for improved policy and practice and a focus for further studies in this area.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-18 12:24:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials in which participants were randomly allocated to either an experimental or a control group, the latter being a waiting-list, no-treatment or placebo control group. Studies that randomised participants to an intervention and alternative treatment group (i.e. without a control group), have also been included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if the intervention was provided directly to parents of children aged 0 - 19 years. Programmes had to have targeted parents who have a history of physical abuse or neglect.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of brief (i.e. between 6 and 30 weeks) individual or group-based parenting programmes that were provided on a targeted basis (i.e. to parents with a history of abuse or at high-risk of abuse) with a view to preventing the (re)occurence of child maltreatment were eligible for inclusion irrespective of the theoretical basis underpinning the programme. </P>
<P>Parenting programmes were defined as standardised interventions that are delivered to parents with the aim of changing parenting attitudes and practices, improving parenting skills, reducing parenting stress, improving maternal psychosocial functioning, improving family dynamics or reducing child behavioural problems. The review included parenting programmes that have been modified to meet the specific needs of high-risk parents by for example, adding components focused on anger management, stress management or that involved structured interaction with children. </P>
<P>Multifaceted programmes in which it is not possible to assess the independent affect of the parenting programme and intensive home visiting programmes were excluded from this review. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>To be eligible for inclusion in the review, studies must have included as an outcome at least one indicator of abuse, neglect or maltreatment (e.g. placement on the child protection register; maltreatment recorded in medical records), non-organic failure-to-thrive or out of home placement of the child/change in primary caretaker or measures of outcomes that are strongly associated with abuse such as for example parental psychopathology, parenting attitudes and practices, and family functioning.</P>

<P>Unblinded critical appraisal of the included studies was conducted independently by two reviewers (JB, IJ). Studies were allocated to one of three quality categories according to the following criteria used in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Category 'A' indicated the use of an adequate method of allocation concealment (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes). Category 'B' indicated uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment was not known). Category 'C' was used to indicate that the method of allocation was not adequately concealed (for example open random number lists or quasi-randomisation using alternate numbers). Other aspects of study quality were also assessed including use of intention-to-treat analysis, standardised outcomes, blinding of assessors, distribution of confounders and numbers of participants.</P>

<B>1.1 Populations<BR/>
</B>Five of the treatment studies comprised physically abusive parents (<LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Egan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>). One study included physically abusive and neglectful parents (<LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>), and a further study failed to specify the type of abuse (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>1.2 Interventions<BR/>
</B>The two most recent studies were conducted in 2004 (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>). One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>), compared the effectiveness of a standard community-group psychoeducational (didactic) programme comprising sessions about listening, the influence of the parents' own upbringing, child development, positive discipline, and anger management with parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) (or PCIT plus individualised enhanced services - not included in this review). The PCIT programme comprised six group-based sessions focused on increasing parental motivation, followed by clinic-based individual parent-child dyad sessions focusing on enhancing skills and establishing daily positive parent-child interaction, followed by command-giving and positive discipline using live coached parent-child dyad sessions. Both programmes were delivered over three modules (comprising thirty sessions). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>) evaluated the effects of the Webster-Stratton Incredible Years programme on the parenting skills of maltreating mothers and on the autonomy of their children. The programme was delivered over the course of eight two-hour weekly sessions and was designed to assist parents in learning how to modify their parenting practices following home visits to assess parent-child interaction.</P>
<P>The two next most recent studies were conducted in the nineties (<LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>). The first of these (<LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>) evaluated the effectiveness of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) designed to change patterns of dysfunctional parent-child relationships. The programme was delivered over fourteen weekly sessions and comprised behaviour management and communication skills training. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>) compared the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed to modify risk factors associated with child physical abuse with an ecologically-based family therapy (FT) programme focused on family interaction. Both services comprised twelve one-hour weekly clinic sessions with follow-up home sessions to evaluate progress.</P>
<P>The remaining three studies were conducted in the eighties (<LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>; Egan 1983; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK> compared the effectiveness of eight weekly group-based parent-training sessions of 1.5 hours duration, focused on human development and child management skills with the use of a clinic-based multi-systemic family therapy comprising individual family-tailored behavioural management strategies. Egan 1983 compared a behavioural child management programme with a stress management training aimed at improving parental emotional control and including relaxation skills training and cognitive restructuring (n.b. this study also includes a combined stress and child management group, but the results for this are not reported separately). <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of a group-based parenting programme comprising instruction in child management techniques, problem solving and modelling of appropriate child management using videotaped vignettes, and self-control using deep muscle relaxation. The intervention also included individualsed home-based training procedures in which the families were visited once a week at home to encourage the implementation of new techniques.<BR/>

<B>Outcomes<BR/>
</B>Three studies provided an objective assessment of abuse by examining the impact of the intervention on incidence of child abuse (i.e. reported or suspected by caseworkers) (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>), number of injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>), or reported (school staff, relatives or family members) physical abuse (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>). The remaining studies all provide assessments of proxy measures of abusive parenting only. Most studies used parent reports of a range of outcomes including parental psychopathology, anger, stress, depression, social skills, child abuse potential, and family functioning. One study also included child reported outcomes (e.g. parental anger; family problems) (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>). Four treatment studies reported independent assessments of parental outcomes such as researcher observed child management skills (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Egan 1983</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>USE OF RANDOMISATION</B>
<BR/>Of the 7 included studies, four were randomised controlled trials in which parents were randomly allocated to a treatment group or a no-treatment/waiting list control group (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>; Egan 1983; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>). The three remaining studies randomly allocated families to an intervention group or alternative treatment control group (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>). One study randomised families to a control group or three alternative treatment groups but only reported the findings for the treatment groups (Egan 1983).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT</B>
<BR/>None of the included studies provided information regarding the method of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>INTENTION-TO-TREAT</B>
<BR/>None of the studies analysed participants in the groups to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they dropped out or were lost to follow-up (i.e. intention-to-treat). </P>
<P>One study failed to provide details about whether participants dropped out of the evaluation or were lost to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>). The average dropout appeared to be in the region of 10% with as many as 23% in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>). In one study dropout was associated with baseline measures of parents experiencing less stress and having fewer problems (<LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>), and in a second with with being younger, better educated and less depressed, but having less social support (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>STANDARDISED OUTCOMES</B>
<BR/>The majority of included studies used standardised measures. Two studies used non-standardised outcome measures that were designed specifically for the purpose of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>BLINDING OF ASSESSORS</B>
<BR/>In trials of parenting programmes it is not possible to blind either facilitators or parents to the type of treatment being implemented or received. One of the methods of minimising bias arising from failure to blind parents and study personnel is to blind assessors of clinical outcomes. Only three studies report that independent assessment was undertaken blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brunk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brunk 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>). No independent assessments of outcome were undertaken by <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1996</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Terao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Terao 1999</LINK>. One study submitted the coding of parent-child interaction for independent assessment by a panel of experts to reduce bias but makes no mention of blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>). One study used independent assessment but did not state that blinding was undertaken (Egan 1983). </P>
<P>
<B>DISTRIBUTION OF CONFOUNDERS<BR/>
</B>While the use of randomisation should in theory ensure that any possible confounders are equally distributed between the groups, the randomisation of small numbers of study participants may result in an unequal distribution of confounding factors. All studies provided information about the distribution of possible confounders (i.e. to what extent the control and intervention groups were similar at the start of the trial).</P>
<P>
<B>NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS <BR/>
</B>The number of participants in each study ranged from 16 (<LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1981</LINK>) to 110 (<LINK REF="STD-Chaffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chaffin 2004</LINK>). Some of the studies may therefore have been underpowered.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Overall, only three of the included studies assessed the impact of the programme on objective measures of child abuse. This may reflect the fact that such assessments require long-term follow-up, and the majority of included studies provided immediate post-intervention assessment only. Small numbers precluded the possibility of drawing any definitive conclusions, but one study suggests that parent-child interaction therapy can reduce re-reports of physical abuse.</P>
<P>Data were extracted on a range of measures that may be used as proxy assessments of abusive parenting. The effect sizes obtained are on the whole only small to medium. Furthermore, while most of the results favoured the intervention group, many also failed to achieve statistical significance. This result was possibly due to the small sample sizes in many of the included studies. However, due to the large number of diverse outcomes that were used it was not possible to test this using meta-analysis. </P>
<P>There is in addition, some variability in the results across trials, and this may be due to the fact that the quality of the included studies is variable. Four studies used an alternative treatment group as opposed to a control group, and many of the studies failed to provide details about allocation concealment or whether the analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The results from these studies, should therefore, be treated with caution.</P>
<P>In terms of the applicability of the results, the studies mostly comprised physically abusive parents, and the results of this review may not therefore apply to neglectful parents. While many of the included papers provide further information about the broader risk status of the parents in terms of poverty, education and ethnicity, it is not clear to what extent the included parents were homogenous in terms of their use of physical abuse. This makes it difficult to know exactly which group of physically abusing parents are most likely to benefit from a parenting programme. </P>
<P>The studies that used an alternative treatment group (as opposed to a control group) permitted some assessment as to whether programmes that incorporate additional components aimed specifically at addressing factors such as parental anger, motivation, and parent-child interaction, are more effective than standard programmes. While many of the findings failed to achieve significance, some of the effect sizes in the region of 0.3 - 0.4 favoured programmes that had either additional components or that were based on the use of theoretical approaches specifically aimed at addressing problems associated with abusive parenting. For example, one parent-child interaction therapy parent training (PCIT) programme that focused specifically on increasing parental motivation followed by sessions focused specifically on parent-child interaction was shown to be more effective than a standard psychoeducational (didactive) parent-training programme. These results are, however, confounded by the fact that the PCIT programme was provided on a one-to-one basis in a clinic while the psychoeducational programme was provided on a group-basis in the community (i.e. the enhanced results for PCIT may be due to the use of one-to-one sessions rather than the content of the sessions). One further study that compared stress training with child management training produced slightly better results for the stress group in terms of child positive affect. This is an interesting finding and may point to the fact that the use of child management techniques on their own i.e. without changing other aspects of the parents behaviour such as mood or stress, are less effective in terms of the child's wellbeing. This study also showed that the group that combined both stress and child management training faired less well in comparison with the stress management or child management groups independently, but this may be due to the fact that it only comprised half of both of the 'pure' training programmes. Overall, these comparative studies suggest that parenting programmes that incorporate additional components aimed specifically at addressing problems associated with abusive parenting (e.g. excessive parental anger, misattributions, poor parent-child interaction) may be more effective than parenting programmes that do not incoporate these. However, further research is needed to assess which components should be provided as core components of parenting programmes for physically abusive parents. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Studies that have incorporated measures of the incidence of physical abuse (e.g. reports of chid abuse, numbers of injuries) provide no evidence to support the use of parenting programmes to treat physical abuse. There is limited evidence that some parenting programmes may be effective in improving some outcomes that are associated with physically abusive parenting. There is also limited evidence to suggest that programmes that provide additional components aimed specifically at addressing factors associated with physically abusive parenting such as anger and stress, may be more effective compared with parenting programmes that do not include such components. In the absence of a robust meta-analysis, these conclusions are, however, impressionistic. Very few of the included studies targeted neglect, and the results of this review may therefore not apply to neglectful parents.</P>
<P>The available evidence points to the potential value of programmes that are based on approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy and child-parent interaction therapy. Other well recognised interventions such as the Webster-Stratton programme - itself within the cognitive-behavioural paradigm - also appear to have a role in treating outcomes that are associated with abusive parenting. While behavioural child management programmes appear to have some benefit, they may need to be more broadly focused to secure improvements in other aspects of parenting such as positive child affect (Egan 1983). Examples of other components include those that address parental mood or stress. </P>
<P>While none of the programmes were effective across all of the outcomes measured, many appeared to have improved some outcomes for some of the participating parents. Parenting programmes, particularly those that are group-based, are increasingly being recognised as being a cost-effective way of intervening to improve parenting (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>), and to provide parents with access to other sources of peer-based support. Overall, while the evidence in inconclusive, there are few other interventions that have better established levels of empirical support as regards intervening with physically abusive parents. The use of parenting programmes that are based on some of the theoretical models (e.g. parent-child interaction therapy and CBT) evaluated as part of the current review may therefore be justified.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Child abuse is a hugely important problem for which there is currently little evidence available of effective treatments. The findings of this review are suggestive that parenting programmes may improve some of the outcomes associated with physically abusive parenting, but the quality of much of the included research failed to meet accepted standards. There is an urgent need for more rigorous evaluations of the effectiveness of parenting programmes in the treatment of physical child abuse, and also neglect. Future research should address some of these methodological deficiencies including the use of random allocation, and blinded assessment of outcome. More specifically, while the current review provided over fifty assessments of outcome, only a very limited number of these could be combined in a meta-analysis due to the absence of compatible measures. The majority of studies used measures of a range of outcomes focusing on different aspects of parental, child and family functioning, and very few included an assessment of the impact of the intervention on the use of physical force or injuries. This suggests the need for researchers to identify common outcomes that can be assessed using standardised measures, <BR/>and for the inclusion of objective assessments of the impact of parenting programmes on the incidence of child abuse using outcomes such as the number of children on the child protection register and number of injuries. Perhaps most importantly, such assessments will not be possible without the funding of much longer-term studies. Furthermore, the wide confidence intervals that were obtained for most of the included studies may have been due to the small sample sizes, and future research should involve the recruitment of larger samples thereby reducing the likelihood of weak statistical power. There was also an increased likelihood of type I errors due to the testing of multiple outcomes, pointing to the need for future studies to focus on specific outcomes on which it has been hypothesised that the intervention will have an impact.</P>
<P>A number of important questions remain to be addressed concerning the effectiveness of parenting programmes in the treatment of physical child abuse and neglect. These include which type of programme is most effective in improving outcomes for abusive parents (it seems likely that programmes focusing on abusive parenting will be less suitable to address the problems of neglectful parents), and what are the key components of effective programmes; whether different programmes vary in the impact they have on the different outcomes; whether some high risk parents are more likely to drop out of parenting programmes and what can be done to increase their compliance. Further research is also needed about the additive effect of parenting programmes that are provided in conjunction with other prevention or treatment programmes e.g. home visiting; family therapy.</P>
<P>Research is also needed that focuses on the process of programme delivery. Few of the included studies made any reference to this issue. <LINK REF="REF-Buttigieg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttigieg 1995</LINK> describes difficulties in evaluating parenting programmes for vulnerable clients and describes the use of 'hard outcome measures' as limited when compared with qualitative outcomes such as support, empowerment and the relationship between the professional and the client. Furthermore, Buttigieg suggests that in many cases, this type of factor can play an important role in influencing outcomes such as the risk of child abuse or reception into care, and that future evaluation should include their assessment.</P>
