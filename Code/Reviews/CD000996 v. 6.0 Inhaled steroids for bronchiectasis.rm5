This is ready for publication now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that the disease population may be a little unclear. There are now too distinct groups of patients with bronchiectasis. The patients with bronchiectasis who are largely non smokers and&amp;#160; have bronchiectasis for a variety o reasons , the largest groups being post infection and idiopathic (worth quoting Rob Wilson&amp;#8217;s data from Shoemark et al&amp;#160; Respiratory Medicine 2007 ,&amp;#160; which is an update on the Pasteur paper&amp;#160; Am J Respir Crit Care 2000)&amp;#160; However there is a new group of patients with COPD associated bronchiectasis who may respond differently (as alluded to in the text)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this needs to be made clearer in the background paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion is well balanced. Again it is worth emphasising the point that bronchiectasis is not the same as COPD or CF .The discussion of the Martinez paper is appropriate and again serves to emphasise that bronchiectasis in the context of COPD may have a different response to non smoker&amp;#8217;s bronchiectasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no mention of the potential adverse effect of pneumonia which has become a feature of recent studies of ICS in COPD. This should be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for practice in terms of not recommending inhaled steroids for routine use are fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement that surveillance sputum bacteriology is recommended following the statement that a side effect is increasing bacterial density is odd. In clinical practice quantitative culture is not routinely available and no advice is given regarding a threshold for stopping treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is probably more practical to say that patients should be kept under regular follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 27th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could Anne respond the Peer Review Feedback please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 19th CJC recheck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the data for cough was not entered correctly for Martinez and I have changed this to 15 patients in the 1000 group and 16 in the placebo group (not 8 and 15). Can you check that you agree with this? I have also modified the change from protocol section to make clear that no placebo was used in the Martinez study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with these minor changes we can send this out for peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS (technical): Toby could you switch off the totals for single study outcomes please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr Cates&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks a lot for your comments on the review. As suggested by you, we have made the following changes in the review&lt;br&gt;1.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Added a note in the ?Change from protocol? that the Martinez study did not have a placebo arm.&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;For the Martinez study, the reason why we utilised data from the 1000 microgram has been explained since this was in uniformity with the three Tsang studies that used the same dose.&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;The 500 microgram data has been included in the sensitivity analysis.&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;The withdrawals in the Martinez study have been accounted for by the ITT in the way that it has been presumed that the withdrawals did not have the favourable outcome. For example, in the 1000F group, 14/29 had &amp;gt; 50% reduction in sputum volume. We have accounted for the two withdrawals as not having &amp;gt; 50% reduction. So it becomes 14/31. So, to get those without &amp;gt;50% reduction in sputum, we got, 17/31. Similarly for other parameters. We had to change the variable to negative in these two instances (50% reduction in sputum and dyspnea score) to get the direction correctly on the graph, or we would have had to make separate graphs.&lt;br&gt;5.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Added a note about the outcome variables that were added post hoc.&lt;br&gt;6.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;The data used from the figure 4 gives the actual volume of sputum and not the change in volume as written below the figure. This becomes clearer if you see the figure in correlation to Table 1.&lt;br&gt;7.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;We have removed the variable sputum volume of the TSANG 2005 study from the analysis, after further advice from Toby&lt;br&gt;8.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;We have completely removed the comparison 3 (combined data from short term and the long-term studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 August 2008 CJC editorial comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the hard work that has gone into this review. Thanks also for sending through the data from the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTINEZ STUDY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I note that the original version included only double blind studies and Martinez would not have been included. This needs to be mentioned in the changes from protocol. Also the decision to only use the 1000 FP arm needs to be explained (it looks as if this could have been driven by the results). I think the 500 arm should be included in the review, at least as senstivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a problem with the Martinez data as you have not accounted for the withdrawals so you cannot just subtract the number of patients who did have a 50% reduction from the total. You might want to use the reported outcome and change the labels on the graph (for all the dichotomous outcomes in comparison 1). Was this a prespecified outcome in the protocol - if not you need to say this was post hoc! The same applies to the dyspnoea score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Martinez exacerbation must be skewed (SD same as mean) but this may not matter too much as this is a negative outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did you choose not to use the change in sputum with its SD as reported in Martinez?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSANG 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot enter Median results into RevMan. The Mean and CI are given for the sputum volume difference in Table 3 and this could be entered instead using Generic Inverse Variance. As the data are skewed this comes with a health warning but Toby could help you with this if you want to do it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL TIMES OUTCOMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot combine results using different scales as the SD units are not compatible. TSANG 2005 is % predicted and the SD is much bigger than the other studies. You must either use SMD or not combine the short and long studies for this outcome. I would favour removing this Comparison completely. The amount of sputum is much higher in Martinez than Tsang!&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-03-09 11:41:26 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="IST-BRO" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.25" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:32:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>People with bronchiectasis have significant morbidity (e.g. cough, wheeze, sputum production) and have more rapid lung function decline. As asthma like symptoms are common in people with bronchiectasis, the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids is potentially beneficial in reducing exacerbations, symptoms and pulmonary decline. The review found that there is insufficient evidence for the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids in people with bronchiectasis. While inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial in a subgroup of people with bronchiectasis, its use has to be balanced with adverse effects that include potential increase in commensal bacterial density in the sputum.</P>

<P>Bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries and in some ethnic populations of affluent countries.

<P>There were no paediatric studies. Six adult studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of the 303 randomised, 278 subjects completed the trials. In the short term group (ICS for less then 6 months duration), adults on huge doses of ICS (2g per day of budesonide equivalent) had significantly improved forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), forced vital capacity (FVC), Quality of life (QOL) score and sputum volume but no significant difference in peak flow, exacerbations, cough or wheeze, when compared to adults in the control arm (no ICS). When only placebo-controlled studies were included, there were no significant difference between groups in all outcomes examined (spirometry, clinical outcomes of exacerbation or sputum volume etc). The single study on long term outcomes showed no significant effect of inhaled steroids in any of the outcomes. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-31 06:40:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of inhaled steroids in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. While a therapeutic trial may be justified in adults with difficult to control symptoms and in certain subgroups, this has to be balanced with adverse events especially if high doses are used. No recommendation can be made for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state) as there were no studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:01:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Bronchiectasis, previously termed an 'orphan disease' is increasingly recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Karadag-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karadag 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Karakoc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karakoc 2001</LINK>) and in some ethnic populations of affluent countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2000</LINK>). The underlying aetiology of bronchiectasis varies from post recurrent respiratory infections to rare immune deficiencies. Other causes include primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Mycobacterial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Shoemark-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemark 2007</LINK>). However, bronchiectasis is also a common pathway for a variety of diseases. Thus, the presence of bronchiectasis is also increasingly recognised in common (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>) and uncommon respiratory diseases (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>) and sarcoidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>)) as well non primary respiratory (e.g. autoimmune) diseases. When bronchiectasis is present with another underlying disorder, it increases the morbidity and mortality of the underlying diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>). For example, in diseases like COPD the presence of bronchiectasis has been reported in 29-50% (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>) of cohorts and when present, increases the severity (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>) and frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Gursel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gursel 2006</LINK>) of respiratory exacerbations. Thus, management of the symptoms and severity of bronchiectasis is important.</P>
<P>The dominant symptoms and signs of bronchiectasis are productive or wet cough, dyspnoea on exertion and presence of other respiratory signs (clubbing, chest wall deformity, respiratory noises such as wheeze or crepitations on auscultation). In the long term, pulmonary decline may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Twiss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twiss 2006</LINK>). In both children and adult cohort studies, asthma-like symptoms in people with bronchiectasis have been described and when present, is associated with accelerated pulmonary decline when compared to those with bronchiectasis but without asthma-like symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>Like patients with COPD, children and adults with bronchiectasis also suffer from recurrent acute exacerbations, some of whom require hospitalised treatment. Effective management regimes for bronchiectasis would reduce the frequency or severity of respiratory exacerbations, and/or the long term pulmonary decline. Based on Cole's 'vicious circle hypothesis', microbial colonization/infection is important in the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis as it leads to bronchial obstruction and a normal or exaggerated inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>). Neutrophilic airway inflammation is dominant in people with bronchiectasis and COPD and ICS is likely beneficial in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2006</LINK>). However use of ICS is associated with adverse events in children and adults that range from mild (candidiasis) to serious (adrenal insufficiency, osteoporosis, cataracts) events. Thus a systematic review on the efficacy of ICS in the management of children and adults with bronchiectasis would help guide clinical practice. This current review was significantly revised from a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2000</LINK>).<BR/>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 11:46:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, two reviewers (NK, AC) independently reviewed the literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text using specific criteria, the same two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion. Agreement was measured using kappa statistics. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-26 12:33:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible subjects), inclusion and exclusion criteria, other symptoms, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, dose and type of intervention, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data were extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information was requested from the authors but only two (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2004</LINK>) responded with limited further information.</P>

<P>We assessed the risk of bias for each of the studies included in the review independently (by two reviewers: NK &amp; AC).</P>
<P>Four components of quality were assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment. Trials were scored as: Adequate concealment (low risk of bias); Unclear (unclear risk of bias); clearly inadequate concealment (high risk of bias).</LI>
<LI>Blinding. Trials were scored as: Participant and care provider and outcome assessor blinded and/or outcome assessor blinded (low risk of bias); unclear (unclear risk of bias); no blinding of outcome assessor (high risk of bias).</LI>
<LI>Reporting of participants by allocated group. Trials were scored as: Progress of all randomised participants in each group described (low risk of bias); Unclear or no mention of withdrawals or dropouts (high risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>Follow-up. Trials were scored as: Outcomes measured in &gt;90% (where withdrawals due to complications and side-effects are categorised as treatment failures, low risk of bias), Grade B: Outcomes measured in 80-90%, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: Outcomes measured in &lt;80%.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-18 06:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, odds ratio (OR) was calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that participants not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) is reasonable. This took into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
<P>Results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest were included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were calculated (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 5). For cross-over studies, mean treatment differences were calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed effects generic inverse variance (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% confidence intervals. In cross-over trials, only data from the first arm were included in meta-analysis when the data were combined with parallel studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference was used. Any heterogeneity between the study results was described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model were included whenever there are concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>

All studies were double blind studies except <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK> which did not have a placebo arm and blinding was done only for comparing two dosages of ICS. The baseline values for lung functions, sputum amount and sputum inflammatory markers were significantly different clinically in <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1998</LINK> and thus were subject to bias. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK>) reported the progress of all randomised subjects in each group described whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2004</LINK> there was no mention of withdrawals or dropouts. As the pre crossover arm data could not be extracted, data from <LINK REF="STD-Elborn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 1992</LINK> could not be included in any of the meta-analysis. The follow up was between 80-90% in <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK> and was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2004</LINK>.

<P>Inclusion of only those patients who had a significant post bronchodilator response in <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2004</LINK> biased the study in favour of response to ICS since those with positive bronchodilator response are more likely to improve with ICS due to the asthma like reversibility in their airway.</P>

Using ITT analysis, the number of subjects without sputum reduction as well as without improvement in dyspnoea (comparison 1.1.3 and 1.1.4) were significantly more in the control arm compared to the ICS arm. Subjects in the ICS group were significantly better than the control arm in the parameters of sputum volume reduction (OR of 7.69, 95%CI 1.92 to 30.70) and improvement in dyspnoea (OR of 3.33, 95%CI 1.17 to 9.43).

<P>a) <I>Sputum volume per day </I>: As an overall effect, ICS had no effect on the 24 hour sputum volume when given for a period of 52 weeks though the data for this outcome was not included in the analysis because only median and interquartile range were available and the data was very skewed. As a subgroup analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK> report a significant improvement in the amount of sputum volume/ day in the subgroup of patients with sputum volume &lt; 30 ml/ day, exacerbation frequency &lt;= 2/year, and sputum purulence score score &gt;5 (Data not available).</P>
<P>b) <I>Sputum purulence score (Outcome 2.3.1)</I>: Sputum purulence was scored as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8 (absence of, completely transparent, almost transparent, translucent but colourless, opaque and milky white grey, pale green, moderately green, and dark green sputum, respectively) in <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK>. After 52 weeks, there was no difference in the purulence scores between the ICS and placebo group; MD (fixed) = 0.2 ( 95% CI -0.94 to 1.34)</P>
<P>c) <I>FeNO at 52 weeks (Outcome 2.3.2)</I>: <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2004</LINK> showed no change in the FeNO between the two groups at 52 weeks with a MD (fixed) of -1.20 [95% CI -6.82 to 4.42]</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>As mentioned in comparisons 1 , removing the study with a poor quality score (no placebo) altered the results for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC from being significant to non significant between the ICS and control groups. On replacing the data from the fluticasone 1000µg arm of <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK> with the 500µg data in the meta-analysis, improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> still favoured the ICS group with a mean difference (fixed) of 0.06 (95% CI 0.01, 0.10) though the effect was less, whereas the effect of ICS became non significant for the parameter of FVC (mean difference of 0.05, 95% CI -0.03, 0.12). For the clinical data, the difference between the groups was still significant (favouring ICS group) for number of subjects without sputum volume reduction of &gt;50% (OR of 0.19, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.79) though the variable of amount of sputum became non significant with MD (fixed) = -5.7 (95% CI -14.9, 3.5). For the outcomes of wheeze (OR of 0.65, 95%CI 0.22, 1.87) and cough (OR of 0.59, 95%CI 0.21, 1.62), there was still no difference between the groups. For the outcome of dyspnoea, actual data was not provided for the 500µg arm but the authors mentioned that there was no difference between groups. Hence it is assumed that the significant effect present for the 1000µg/day group (outcome 1.1.4) was no longer present for the 500µg/day group. Also, there was no change (i.e. no difference between groups) in the other outcome variables (diffusion capacity, residual volume, total lung capacity and exacerbation frequency)..</P>
<P>Analysis using random effects did not alter the significance of any of the outcomes. None of the other planned sensitivity analysis were relevant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:01:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The meta-analysis based on six studies involving 303 adults has shown that use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids in patients with non CF bronchiectasis leads to a statistically significant though clinically minor improvement in the lung function indices of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC but not for peak flow. However when the study that was not placebo-controlled was excluded, there was no significant difference between groups in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or FVC. Also there was no difference between groups for the other outcomes (exacerbations, sputum volume, clinical symptoms and FeNO).</P>
<P>The three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1998</LINK>) included in the short term effect of inhaled steroids in bronchiectasis showed a clinically small benefit of ICS on lung function parameters of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC. Two of the studies reported no significant difference between groups and the major contribution with a positive effect was that from <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>. Thus not surprisingly when Martinez&#8217;s study was excluded based on quality (no placebo), the groups no longer differed. Also there was no difference between groups for PEFR, diffusion capacity and TLC. Nevertheless, <LINK REF="STD-Elborn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 1992</LINK> data which could not be included in the meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in the FEV<SUB>1</SUB> as well as the 24 hour sputum volume in the ICS group compared to placebo group.</P>
<P>Data on the short term effect of ICS on clinical parameters of cough, wheeze, dyspnoea and sputum volume was available only from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>). This showed a significant improvement in dyspnoea and sputum volume for the higher dose of fluticasone (1000µg/day) compared to the control group The lack of a placebo arm in this study makes assessment of these outcomes biased. The effect was also lost when data from 1000ug/day fluticasone was substituted by that for 500µg/day. Data on sputum volume from <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1998</LINK> was not included in the analysis in view of clinically significant difference in the baseline values. <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK> showed a significant improvement in the quality of life score in the ICS group using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire but was not included in the final analysis since it encompassed all the symptoms already included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Recurrent acute pulmonary exacerbations form part of the disease progression in patients with bronchiectasis and many of these exacerbations require hospital admission. Recurrent exacerbations not only lead to progressive deterioration of lung functions (<LINK REF="REF-Ellerman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellerman 1997</LINK>) but are also one of the strong predictors of poor quality of life in bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1997</LINK>). In this review, short term use of ICS did not significantly influence frequency of exacerbations . Prolonged ICS administration also did not significantly influence exacerbation frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK>).This becomes more relevant with the fact that ICS actually increased the bacterial density in the airways (<LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1998</LINK>) and most exacerbations in bronchiectasis are likely of infective in origin. Though exacerbation was defined in a similar manner in all three studies, its definition in bronchiectasis, specially paediatric bronchiectasis, is not standardized (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2008</LINK>). For further research into prevention and treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbation to be useful, we need a consensus on the definition of exacerbation.</P>
<P>Administration of inhaled steroids for a longer duration (<LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2005</LINK>) significantly increased the number of subjects who had a more than 20% reduction in the 24 hour sputum volume but did not have any beneficial effect in the other clinical or spirometric parameters. This lack of effect again suggests that infection and not pure inflammation, is probably the more relevant underlying pathogenic mechanism of disease progression in bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>Persistent inflammation plays a role in deterioration of lung function in bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Ip-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ip 1993</LINK>). Studies in adults with CF suggest that ICS treatment improves bronchial hyper-responsiveness and spirometric parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Haren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Haren 1995</LINK>). Thus it is theoretically possible that ICS may improve the lung functions and with it clinical parameters in non CF bronchiectasis as well. However this review has shown that any benefit from ICS is inconsistent. However given the increased presence of airway hyper-responsiveness in patients with non CF bronchiectasis, it is possible that ICS may have a role in this subgroup.</P>
<P>Moreover, even in CF, the clinical benefits of ICS have been difficult to demonstrate. A Cochrane review of ICS in CF concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine if they are beneficial or harmful (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 2000</LINK>). In a large prospective, multicenter study, withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids for 6 months was not associated with significant worsening of CF lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour 2006</LINK>). Patients in whom steroids were discontinued did not have a change in lung function over time, an increased need for oral or intravenous antibiotics, or a shorter time to pulmonary exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nearly 50% of adults with COPD have bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2008</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2007</LINK>) concluded that ICS administration reduce the rate of exacerbations as well as the rate of decline in quality of life in patients with stable state COPD. As the <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK> study included subjects who were smokers, there is a possibility that some of these subjects had COPD and this may influence the positive findings in that study. It also indicates that COPD associated bronchiectasis may respond differently to treatment modalities when compared to bronchiectasis associated with other causes.</P>
<P>Also, the beneficial effect if any of long term administration of high dose ICS has to be weighed against the potential adverse effects associated with it. High dose ICS use is associated with adverse events in children and adults that range from mild events (candidiasis) to serious events (pneumonia, adrenal insufficiency, osteoporosis, cataracts), <LINK REF="REF-Sobieraj-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobieraj 2008</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK> reported dry mouth, local irritation and transient dysphonia as the most common adverse effects. None of the other studies reported any adverse effects.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of the Review</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review is limited to 6 adult studies with variable designs, variable doses and length of study. Also data extraction was limited to only one to 4 studies for the outcomes examined. The small sample size (max 101) for the meta-analysis is also a significant limitation. The major contributor to the benefit of ICS was from a non-placebo controlled study.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-23 03:07:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of inhaled steroids in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2006</LINK>) that showed a benefit was a non-placebo controlled trial. In a second study benefit was found only with subgroup analysis and very high doses were utilised. While a therapeutic trial may be justified in patients with difficult to control symptoms, this has to be balanced with adverse events especially if high doses are used. In bronchiectasis, the adverse effect of ICS includes increased bacteria density and thus surveillance sputum bacteriology is recommended. No recommendation can be made for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation, or in children (for any state) as there were no studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:01:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Further studies are required to examine the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on short and long term outcomes for children and adults with non-CF bronchiectasis. Outcomes should include exacerbations (rate and hospital admission), symptoms, quality of life, lung function indices and inflammatory parameters and bacteriology. Studies are required in both stable state and during an acute exacerbation state. A validated and standardised definition of acute respiratory exacerbation is also required. Adult studies should clearly differentiate co-existent COPD as the presence of this may influence effect of ICS. A priori analysis for those with AHR should also be defined since its presence may influence ICS response.</P>
