<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-16 06:27:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive fungal infections are a significant problem for children whose immune system is not functioning properly. The majority of the children have cancer. Antifungal medications can be given when these children develop a fever (for example a fever occurring when the white cells or neutrophils are low during chemotherapy) or when an infection has been formally identified (as in candidaemia, candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis). The antifungal agents that were compared appear equally efficacious. Pooling the data from the few studies that were available suggest kidney damage was less likely with a lipid preparation of amphotericin B compared with conventional amphotericin B. It is reasonable to recommend a lipid preparation of amphotericin B, if cost permits. No significant differences have been observed in children when other antifungal agents have been compared. More studies in children evaluating available antifungal are required to further clarify any benefits with regard to the risk of dying, prospects of complete recovery and drug toxicities.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2008), EMBASE (1980 to September 2008) and CINAHL (1988 to September 2008) without language restrictions.

<P>We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing a systemic antifungal agent with a comparator (including placebo) in children (one month to 16 years) with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infection.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-16 06:11:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. We synthesised data using the random-effects model and expressed results as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-16 06:47:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials of antifungal agents in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia (suspected fungal infection) and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis (proven fungal infection). Four trials compared a lipid preparation of amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B (395 participants), one trial compared an echinocandin with a lipid preparation of amphotericin B (82 participants) in suspected infection; one trial compared an echinocandin with a lipid preparation of amphotericin B in children with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis (109 participants) and one trial compared different azole antifungals in children with candidaemia (43 participants). No difference in all-cause mortality and other primary endpoints (mortality related to fungal infection or complete resolution of fungal infections) were observed. No difference in breakthrough fungal infection was observed in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia.</P>
<P>When lipid preparations and conventional amphotericin B were compared in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia, nephrotoxicity was less frequently observed with a lipid preparation (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.90, P = 0.02) however substantial heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%, P = 0.06). Children receiving liposomal amphotericin B were less likely to develop infusion-related reactions compared with conventional amphotericin B (chills: RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.64, P = 0.0005). Children receiving a colloidal dispersion were more likely to develop such reactions than with liposomal amphotericin B (chills: RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.85, P = 0.02). The rate of other clinically significant adverse reactions attributed to the antifungal agent (total reactions; total reactions leading to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or change in therapy; hypokalaemia and hepatotoxicity) were not significantly different. When echinocandins and lipid preparations were compared, the rate of clinically significant adverse reactions (total reactions; total reactions leading to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or change in therapy) were not significantly different.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-17 03:49:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited paediatric data are available comparing antifungal agents in children with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infection. No differences in mortality or treatment efficacy were observed when antifungal agents were compared. Children are less likely to develop nephrotoxicity with a lipid preparation of amphotericin B compared with conventional amphotericin B. Further comparative paediatric antifungal drug trials and epidemiological and pharmacological studies are required highlighting the differences between neonates, children and adults with invasive fungal infections.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-16 06:50:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive fungal infections (IFI) cause significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of IFI is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Groll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groll 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marr 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>). Most children who develop fungal infections have received chemotherapy for a malignancy or have undergone a haematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant. The incidence of IFI in these groups is between 5% and 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Groll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groll 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2005</LINK>). A minority of children developing IFI have a congenital or acquired immunodeficiency such as chronic granulomatous disease or HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Dvorak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dvorak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinbach-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinbach 2005a</LINK>). Mortality is high in those who develop IFI and is influenced by the type of fungus, site of disease and presence of ongoing immunosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Dvorak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dvorak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Definitive diagnosis by tissue microscopy and culture is difficult in the early stages of infection. Using host factor and microbiological and clinical criteria, current definitions exist for proven, probable and possible invasive fungal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ascioglu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascioglu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Pauw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Pauw 2008</LINK>). In practice, IFI is often suspected in those with persistent fever and neutropenia who fail to respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, within three to five days, and in whom a reasonable attempt has been made to exclude bacterial and viral infections. As mortality is high, early and aggressive treatment of suspected infections with empiric antifungal therapy is common (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>). Empirical antifungal therapy is associated with a lower incidence of IFI yet no demonstrable survival benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2008</LINK>). As many of the patients with persistent fever and neutropenia who receive empiric therapy do not have a fungal infection, there is increasing interest in biological markers and radiological imaging to identify those at highest risk of IFI (<LINK REF="REF-Cordonnier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordonnier 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maertens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maertens 2005</LINK>). There are currently insufficient data to support this approach in children.</P>
<P>Conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate is a broad spectrum antifungal agent that has previously been the treatment of choice for most IFI. Its use is complicated by nephrotoxicity and infusion-related reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Gallis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallis 1990</LINK>). More recently, lipid formulations of amphotericin B have become available and have less toxicity. Triazole derivatives (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole) and echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) have increased the number of available agents. The role of biological agents (for example antiHSP90 monoclonal antibodies, Mycograb®) is being explored (<LINK REF="REF-Pachl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pachl 2006</LINK>). The increasing use of combination antifungal therapy adds further complexity to decision making about treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Marr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mukherjee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukherjee 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared different antifungal agents in immunocompromised adults, as empirical treatment in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentice-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winston 2000</LINK>), treatment of invasive aspergillosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbrecht-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbrecht 2002</LINK>) and invasive candidal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Kuse-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuse 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mora_x002d_Duarte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mora-Duarte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reboli-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reboli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rex-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 1994</LINK>). Many differences, particularly with respect to antifungal toxicity and cost, have been demonstrated. As significant variation exists between adult and paediatric antifungal pharmacokinetics (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brammer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brammer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2005</LINK>) cautious interpretation of the efficacy, toxicity and economic endpoints from these trials is required when managing children with IFI. It remains unclear which is the most appropriate antifungal agent to treat children with proven, probable or suspected IFI.</P>

<P>Infants and children (age older than 28 days and up to 16 years) with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infection were included.

Proven or probable invasive fungal infection was defined as a clinical illness consistent with infection plus either radiological, histopathological or microbiological evidence of invasive fungal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ascioglu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascioglu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Pauw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Pauw 2008</LINK>).

<P>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic and hand searching were downloaded to a reference management database and duplicates removed. Two review authors (CCB, KH) were responsible for handsearching, examination of electronic search results and identification of potentially eligible studies. Full reports of these studies were retrieved and reviewed independently for inclusion by the same two review authors. Any differences were resolved by discussion with and referral to two further review authors (PP, TO). We contacted authors for clarification of trial methods and to request individual patient data when required. The reasons for exclusion of studies that were reviewed as full texts were recorded.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-18 11:09:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Two review authors (CCB, KH) graded the selected studies independently. Every study was assessed following the criterion grading system described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 5.0.0 (updated September 2009) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). The results were summarised in the risk of bias tables for each included study. The grading was compared and any inconsistencies between the review authors in the interpretation of inclusion criteria and their significance to the selected studies were discussed and resolved.<BR/>
<BR/>The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the following six questions.</P>
<P>(1) Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>Each study was graded as yes (that is allocation sequence was adequately generated with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is allocation sequence was not adequately generated with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear. Adequate allocation sequence generation included: random number tables, computer random number generators, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice or drawing of lots.</P>
<P>(2) Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>Each study was graded as yes (that is allocation sequence was adequately concealed with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is allocation sequence was not adequately concealed with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear. Adequate allocation concealment included: central allocation methods (for example telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation), sequential numbered drug containers of identical appearance or sequentially numbered, opaque or sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>(3) Was knowledge of the allocation interventions adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>Each study was graded as yes (that is knowledge of the allocation interventions was adequately prevented with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is knowledge of the allocation interventions was not adequately prevented with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear. Knowledge of the allocation interventions was adequately prevented when blinding of participants and outcome assessors were maintained for objective outcomes, and both of these groups plus the healthcare workers involved were blinded for subjective outcomes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>(4) Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>Each study was graded as yes (that is incomplete outcome data were adequately address with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is incomplete outcome data were not adequately address with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear. Incomplete outcome data were adequate addressed if: outcome data were not missing, the reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to true outcomes, missing outcome data were balanced in numbers across the intervention groups with similar reasons for missing data across groups, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate (dichotomous outcome data), the plausible effect size among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the observed effect sizes (continuous outcome data) or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>(5) Were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>Each study was graded as yes (that is the reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is the reports of the study were not free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear. The reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting if: the study protocol was available and all of the study's pre-specified outcomes that were of interest in the review had been reported in the pre-specified way; or if the study protocol was not available, it was clear that the published reports included all expected outcomes including those that were pre-specified.</P>
<P>(6) Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias?</P>
<P>We recorded any such problems. Specifically we looked for potential sources of bias related to the study design, early trial cessation due to some data-dependent process (for example formal-stopping rule), extreme baseline imbalance between comparator groups and financial considerations (for example withdrawal of participants because they could not pay for drugs). Each study was graded as yes (that is the study was apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias with a subsequent low risk of bias), no (that is the study was not apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias with a subsequent high risk of bias) or unclear.<BR/>

<P>All analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.0 software. As an estimate of the statistical significance of a difference in proportional outcomes between experimental and control interventions, we calculated the relative risk (RR) for benefit using antifungal therapy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed a statistically significant difference between the experimental intervention and control intervention if the 95% CI of the RR did not include the value 1.0. As an estimate of the clinical relevance of any difference between experimental and control interventions, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) with 95% CI, as appropriate. For continuous variables, we converted data to the mean difference (MD) using the inverse variance method and calculated an overall MD. We used a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies (see below), and employed a random-effects model when such heterogeneity was likely.</P>
<P>We pooled data for individual agents as applied to specific fungal infections or described clinical syndromes (that is candidaemia or invasive candidiasis, prolonged fever and neutropenia). We considered the appropriateness of groups of both agents and fungal types for pooled analysis based on the clinical interpretation of the comparisons made. Below are details of each outcome considered, with any specific variation to this approach.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>1. All-cause mortality (defined as death of any randomised patient regardless of cause): we intended to extract the hazard ratio (HR) and variance from trial reports, however only absolute numbers of case fatalities were reported in the included studies. We therefore compared the case fatality rates at specific times (end of therapy, 12 weeks and six months) to estimate the RR between groups.</P>
<P>2. IFI-related mortality (defined as death of a patient diagnosed with IFI whose death was attributable to IFI). IFI-related mortality was analysed in the same way as for all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>3. Complete resolution of invasive fungal infection (defined as complete resolution of clinical symptoms, with or without radiological or microbiological findings that led to diagnosis of IFI, enabling cessation of antifungal medication). We dichotomised participants into complete resolution and not resolved.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>4. Partial resolution of invasive fungal infection (defined as any improvement in clinical symptoms with or without radiological findings that led to diagnosis of IFI yet not fulfilling criteria for complete resolution).</P>
<P>5. Resolution of fever in suspected fungal infection (defined as absence of temperature &gt; 38 °C for more than 72 hours or another closely-related definition of resolution of fever).</P>
<P>6. Progression of disease requiring change or addition of an antifungal agent (defined as progression of existing symptoms, with or without radiological or microbiological findings, that were of enough concern for a clinician to change antifungal dose or add a new antifungal agent).</P>
<P>7. Breakthrough fungal infection requiring change or addition of an antifungal agent (defined as new clinical symptoms or signs, with or without radiological or microbiological findings, that were of enough concern for clinicians to change antifungal dose or add a new antifungal agent).</P>
<P>8. Any clinically significant adverse reactions attributed to the antifungal agent resulting in discontinuation, dose reduction or change in the therapy.</P>
<P>9. Any adverse reactions attributed to the antifungal agent including:<BR/>a. abnormal renal function (a number of definitions were accepted including a raised creatinine, a reduced glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance as compared with normal or baseline values);<BR/>b. electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalaemia;<BR/>c. abnormal hepatic function (a number of definitions were accepted including raised transaminases or bilirubin greater than normal or baseline values for age);<BR/>d. infusion-related reactions such as chills, rigors or anaphylaxis;<BR/>e. gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea;<BR/>f. neurological disturbances such as blurred vision or dizziness;<BR/>g. haematological disturbances such as anaemia, granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>10. Length of stay (days). We intended to compare mean length of stay between the groups.</P>
<P>11. Quality of life (QOL). We intended to compare mean QOL scores between the groups.</P>
<P>12. Cost. If available, we intended to discuss the results and implications of any cost analyses reported in any of the included trials.</P>

<P>We examined the data for statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We considered an I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 30% as an indication that an important proportion of the variability between studies could be due to heterogeneity between studies. In that case, or when we suspected significant clinical heterogeneity, we considered the appropriateness of meta-analysis and employed a random-effects model. In the absence of any such indication, we used a fixed-effect model. In the presence of important statistical or clinical heterogeneity we also considered the appropriateness of subgroup analysis for the following factors.</P>
<P>1. Age (infant versus older child).<BR/>2. Underlying immunosuppressive condition (e.g. hematopoietic stem cell transplant, neutropenia, HIV/AIDS, congenital immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive medication).<BR/>3. Concomitant or pre-existing organ dysfunctions (e.g. renal and hepatic impairment).<BR/>4. Purpose of therapy (antifungal therapy for proven or probable infection or empiric therapy for suspected infection).<BR/>5. Site of infection.<BR/>6. Dose of medication.<BR/>7.

<P>All four trials comparing lipid preparations of amphotericin B and conventional amphotericin B in children with fever and neutropenia reported nephrotoxicity endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK>). Nephrotoxicity (defined as &#8805; 100% rise in serum creatinine) occurred in 10 of 48 children (20.1%) receiving liposomal amphotericin and 9 of 47 children (19.1%) receiving conventional amphotericin B (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>). Nephrotoxicity (defined as &#8805; 100% rise in serum creatinine) occurred in 8% of children receiving liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day), 11% receiving liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day) and 21% of children receiving conventional amphotericin B (<LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK>). Absolute numbers were not published by <LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK> so, for pooled analyses, absolute numbers have been calculated from percentages. Three of 25 children (12.0%) receiving ABCD (4 mg/kg/day in both trials) and 11 of 21 (52.4%) receiving conventional amphotericin B (0.8 mg/kg/day in both trials) developed nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK>). Nephrotoxicity was defined in both trials as doubling in serum creatinine level from baseline, an increase of 88 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) in the serum creatinine level from baseline, or a &#8805; 50% decrease in the calculated creatinine clearance from baseline during study drug administration. It should be noted that rates of nephrotoxicity in <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK> were the same. As many children enrolled in the study were treated at the same institutions during similar time periods, it is possible that data have been duplicated in these publications. Clarification from the authors was not forthcoming.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK> was performed. Treatment with a lipid preparation decreased the risk of nephrotoxicity by 57% compared with conventional amphotericin B (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.90, P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%, P = 0.06). The number of children needing to receive a lipid preparation of amphotericin B to avoid one child developing nephrotoxicity was 6 (95% CI 3.9 to 11.8). A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of missing data. Lipid preparations were significantly less toxic in both best-case (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89, P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) and worst-case scenarios (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90, P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). If <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK> were excluded from the analysis (allowing for the possibility of duplicated reporting) the treatment effect was not preserved (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.18, P = 0.12).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-17 03:43:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using data from RCTs comparing antifungal agents in adult populations is a challenge for paediatricians due to differences in comparators, conditions, populations, power and duration of follow up. The paucity of paediatric studies compounds this. Limited data are therefore available to guide paediatricians when managing neonates and children with invasive fungal infection.</P>
<P>Data were available from seven randomised controlled trials enrolling children from two distinct populations, children with candidaemia and invasive candidiasis (that is proven invasive fungal infection) and children with prolonged fever and neutropenia (that is suspected invasive fungal infection). Lipid preparations of amphotericin B (liposomal amphotericin B or amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD)) were compared with conventional amphotericin B in children with prolonged neutropenic fever; echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin) were compared with liposomal amphotericin B in children with prolonged neutropenic fever and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis respectively; and itraconazole was compared with fluconazole in children with candidaemia and invasive candidiasis. No differences in all-cause mortality and other primary endpoints (invasive fungal infection (IFI) related mortality or complete resolution of fungal infections) were observed in indiividual trials or pooled analyses.</P>
<P>The only significant differences in secondary endpoints identified in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia were i) reduced nephrotoxicity with lipid preparations of amphotericin B (liposomal amphotericin B or ABCD) compared with conventional amphotericin B; ii) reduced chills with liposomal amphotericin B when compared with conventional amphotericin B; and iii) increased chills with ABCD compared with conventional amphotericin B. No significant differences were identified in other analyses. The finding of reduced nephrotoxicity with lipid preparations of amphotericin B needs to be interpreted with caution as significant heterogeneity was observed (I <SUP>2 </SUP>= 59%) and it is possible that duplicated reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK>) occurred.</P>
<P>This is the first attempt to use a meta-analytical approach to guide antifungal use in paediatric patients. The comprehensive search for published trials, rigorous attempts to obtain unpublished paediatric data, use of strict outcome definitions and analysis of both individual drugs and drug classes strengthen the findings of the analysis.The studies included were of moderate to high quality as sequence generation was judged to be adequate in five studies, allocation concealment was present in five and blinding used in six of seven included trials.</P>
<P>Numerous limitations exist. In pooling data from the seven trials, low numbers limited power to detect real differences between comparators. Despite attempts to obtain unpublished data, included in combined adult and paediatric trials, this was not always possible. Paediatric patients were enrolled in studies comparing conventional amphotericin B with placebo in the setting of prolonged fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Pizzo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pizzo 1982</LINK>); and numerous studies comparing amphotericin B based products with triazoles in the setting of prolonged fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viscoli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Viscoli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 2000</LINK>), candidaemia or invasive candidiasis (<LINK REF="STD-Kullberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kullberg 2005</LINK>) and invasive aspergillosis (<LINK REF="STD-Herbrecht-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Herbrecht 2002</LINK>). Trials comparing amphotericin B preparations and echinocandins in prolonged fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007</LINK>) and different formulations or dosages of amphotericin B products in prolonged fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Wingard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wingard 2000</LINK>) and invasive aspergillosis (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cornely-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cornely 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1998</LINK>) also enrolled children. As paediatric subgroup analysis was not made available for these trials, it is possible that only significant results have been reported. Furthermore, as unpublished data were only obtained from one study in febrile neutropenic participants (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>) and one study in children with candidaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Mondal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mondal 2004</LINK>), selective reporting may have influenced results. Attempts to overcome this by comparing mixed studies with children-only studies (data not shown) were confounded by the different percentages of children and age ranges in each study. Requests for further data from the relevant companies, not available at the time of publication, may be forthcoming and will be included in any further amendments.</P>
<P>Definitions of treatment success and toxicity varied in different trials making comparison difficult. Differences in duration of follow up in children with fever and neutropenia (seven days in <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; 30 days in <LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>) and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis (12 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Queiroz_x002d_Telles-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Queiroz-Telles 2008</LINK>; median eight weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Mondal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mondal 2004</LINK>) are another source of potential bias. The shorter studies may under-report important outcomes such as invasive fungal infection, death or toxicity. In most studies in febrile neutropenic participants (including <LINK REF="STD-Maertens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Maertens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1998" TYPE="STUDY">White 1998</LINK>) treatment success was measured by a composite endpoint. Key features of the composite endpoints include survival, resolution of fever and the absence of breakthrough fungal infection. Definitions varied however between trials. The relevance of the composite endpoints is debatable, particularly when resolution of fever is a main contributor (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Pauw-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Pauw 2006</LINK>). Minor differences in definition of fever may be relevant, and the resolution of fever is not specific for fungal infection. The power needed to detect real differences in individual endpoints remains a problem as most studies are not of adequate size to do this. Pooling data goes some way to overcoming this. Using data from three trials of children with febrile neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>) greater treatment success was observed with lipid preparations of amphotericin compared with conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.93, P = 0.01, data not shown). This was not defined a priori in our protocol and, therefore, we have not presented it in the results. Cautious interpretation of this finding is necessary as only three trials were included in the analysis, treatment success was defined differently in the different trials, different doses of conventional amphotericin and liposomal amphotericin B were used and no other difference in efficacy endpoints including mortality and breakthrough fungal infection were observed. Moreover, as initial placebo-controlled trials of conventional amphotericin B in prolonged fever and neutropenia were underpowered (<LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pizzo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pizzo 1982</LINK>) and recent meta-analyses have demonstrated no survival benefit when using empiric antifungal therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2008</LINK>), some authors question the role of empiric antifungal therapy in the setting of prolonged fever and neutropenia. A pre-emptive approach to diagnosis of IFI using biological marks and radiological imaging has been studied as an alternative to empiric antifungal therapy in prolonged febrile neutropenia in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Cordonnier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordonnier 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maertens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maertens 2005</LINK>). In the absence of any paediatric data, it is likely that empiric antifungal therapy for suspected antifungal infection will continue to be used in the future.</P>
<P>The analysis of paediatric data yields very similar results to previous adult studies and meta-analyses. No difference in mortality has been demonstrated when lipid preparations of amphotericin B and conventional amphotericin B (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2000</LINK>) or amphotericin B based products and echinocandins (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2004a</LINK>) are compared in the setting of prolonged fever and neutropenia. No difference in mortality has been demonstrated in the setting of candidaemia or invasive candidiasis when amphotericin B based products and echinocandins (<LINK REF="REF-Kuse-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuse 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mora_x002d_Duarte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mora-Duarte 2002</LINK>) or different triazole preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Kullberg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kullberg 2005</LINK>) have been compared. A reduced rate of nephrotoxicity with lipid preparations in children is consistent with previous adult studies and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girois-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girois 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>). Children generally tolerate the renal effects of amphotericin B better than adults due to increased nephronal reserve (<LINK REF="REF-Steinbach-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinbach 2005b</LINK>). The relevance of a doubling of serum creatinine equating to nephrotoxicity is debatable, however it was the most commonly used definition. Less extreme changes in serum creatinine may also be clinically relevant in certain populations, particularly high-risk patients with multiple co-morbidities receiving concurrent nephrotoxins (for example haematopoietic stem cell recipients).</P>
<P>There are numerous deficiencies in the paediatric literature. Paediatric data are insufficient to determine the role of triazole drugs particularly in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis. Despite the increasing use of mould-active triazoles and echinocandins, particularly in children with confirmed or suspected invasive mould infections, little comparative paediatric data exists to guide therapy. The costs of antifungal agents are real considerations for many centres when choosing antifungal therapy. No studies specifically addressed this.</P>

<P>Few significant differences were observed in paediatric antifungal trials in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis. No differences in mortality and efficacy were observed. Conventional amphotericin B was more likely to be associated with nephrotoxicity in children than a lipid preparation. Given the paucity of data and the findings of previous meta-analyses, it is reasonable to recommend a lipid preparation of amphotericin B in this population if cost permits. In studies comparing children receiving an echinocandin and liposomal amphotericin B, no significant differences in efficacy and toxicity were observed. Echinocandins may be considered for use in children with fever with neutropenia and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis as efficacy and safety compared with amphotericin B based products have been demonstrated.</P>

<P>Numerous questions remain unanswered when managing invasive fungal infection. Further epidemiological studies highlighting differences between neonates, children and adults with invasive fungal infection are needed to allow accurate interpretation of the published literature. Further randomised controlled antifungal trials enrolling children are required. The two recent paediatric studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maertens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Maertens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Queiroz_x002d_Telles-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Queiroz-Telles 2008</LINK>) have given hope that more RCTs in paediatric mycology will be undertaken, enabling evidence-based choice when selecting an antifungal agent.</P>
