<P>Exercise, dietary changes and medications are frequently used in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, it is difficult to determine the independent effect of exercise from some trials because exercise has been combined with dietary modifications or medications, or compared with a control which includes another form of intervention. The review authors aimed to determine the effect of exercise on blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>This review found that exercise improves blood sugar control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss. Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programmes is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body's reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids. Quality of life was only assessed in one study, which found no difference between the two groups. No significant difference was found between groups in blood levels of cholesterol or blood pressure. A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were assessed. These included 377 participants and compared groups that differed only with respect to an exercise programme intervention. The duration of the interventions in the studies ranged from eight weeks to one year. Two studies reported follow-up information, one at six months after the end of the six month exercise intervention and one at twelve months post-intervention. Generally, the studies were well-conducted, but blinding of outcome assessors was not reported and although all studies reported that randomisation was performed, few gave details of the method.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>No adverse effects with exercise were reported. The effect of exercise on diabetic complications was not assessed in any of the studies.</P>
<P>The relatively short duration of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation was the small number of participants included in the analyses for adiposity, blood pressure, cholesterol, body's muscle and quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P &lt; 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:37:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from defective insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see 'Additional information' provided by the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in<I> The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About The Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> .</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:52:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>In non-diabetic participants, studies have shown that exercise reduces hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and provides a protective effect against cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Despr_x00e9_s-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Després 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2001</LINK>). Exercise, in addition to diet modification and medication, has long been recommended as one of the three main components to diabetic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Joslin-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joslin 1959</LINK>). People with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to increase physical activity, because studies in people without diabetes suggest it may reduce hyperglycaemia and body fat and improve protection against developing cardiovascular complications. The low cost and non-pharmacological nature of exercise enhances its therapeutic appeal.</P>
<P>Even though exercise is recommended as part of diabetic therapy, its effects in type 2 diabetes are not well documented and there have been no large studies with adequate statistical power to guide practitioners in recommending exercise programmes for the management of type 2 diabetes. Published exercise intervention trials, using different types of intervention, usually have small sample sizes since they are difficult and expensive to conduct. The findings have varied.</P>
<P>The optimal type, frequency, intensity and duration of exercise for achieving therapeutic goals in type 2 diabetes are not known. Aerobic exercise, which is the repetitive cyclical movements caused by contraction of the large muscle masses relying on aerobic energy pathways, is the usual intervention in exercise studies. In aerobic exercise, the muscular and cardiorespiratory systems are involved (for example brisk walking, cycling, swimming, and jogging). Resistance training, which is exercise using muscular strength to move a weight or to work against a resistive load (for example exercise with free weights or weight machines) may also be used as an intervention. Resistance training increases muscle strength and size when performed regularly at a sufficient intensity.</P>
<P>In type 2 diabetes, the promotion of weight loss is one mechanism through which exercise may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Ivy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallberg_x002d_H.-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallberg-H. 1998</LINK>) since obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with metabolic abnormalities in diabetes. However, studies in both diabetic and non-diabetic people demonstrate that, even without any weight loss, exercise may still be beneficial. For example, a single bout of exercise lowers plasma glucose levels and increases insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Wallberg_x002d_H.-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallberg-H. 1998</LINK>). Insulin sensitivity can be measured, using radioimmunoassay, over the period of a three hour oral glucose tolerance test, with blood specimens being tested every half hour (<LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>). The incremental area under the insulin curve thus obtained indicates the degree of insulin sensitivity. The adaptations to a single bout of exercise are short lived (<LINK REF="REF-King-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1995</LINK>) and some of the benefits from exercise training may be due to the repeated acute improvements which follow individual exercise sessions (<LINK REF="REF-Albright--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exercise is usually a general recommendation prescribed for people with type 2 diabetes, especially in the early stages. The longer the disease has been present, the greater likelihood there is of disease complications, which may limit exercise. Possible adverse effects of exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus may include an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise or problems related to foot care (<LINK REF="REF-Constantini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constantini 2005</LINK>). Exercise capabilities may be limited by the presence of retinopathy, neuropathy or nephropathy.</P>
<P>In a review of different weight loss strategies in type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>), the effect of aerobic exercise on diabetic control was reported. Of the 89 studies included, 10% had exercise interventions, but only five studies had a control group. It was concluded that exercise caused a reduction in glycated haemoglobin and a decrease in body mass. A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Boule-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boule 2001</LINK>) addressed the effect of exercise on glycaemic control and body mass in type 2 diabetes and concluded that exercise training reduces glycated haemoglobin, but not body mass. However, Boule et al included some non-randomised controlled trials, and also some trials in which diet was a co-intervention with exercise in the intervention group, while the same diet was not also applied to the control group. Hence, it was not possible to measure the effects of the exercise per se.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:38:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The object of this systematic review was to explore the independent effect of exercise in people with type 2 diabetes. All randomised controlled trials in which the only difference between the intervention group and the comparison group was that the intervention group performed well-documented exercise were included. Our review included a range of outcome measures. We assessed the effects of different types of exercise interventions by performing subgroup analyses, to provide explanations for variations found in individual trials and evaluated the scientific evidence to support or refute the role of exercise interventions.</P>

<P>We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial duration</HEADING>
<P>We included trials of eight weeks or longer, because we wanted to evaluate the effect of ongoing exercise training rather than acute single bouts of exercise. A training period of less than eight weeks would be too short to show alteration in either glycated haemoglobin concentrations or body mass. A post-intervention follow-up of at least six months would have been ideal to specify also, however this was not an absolute criterion for study inclusion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Single bout exercise interventions; studies where the intervention involved only the recommendation of increased physical activity, without further detail; studies where the exercise intervention was not either directly supervised or well-documented; studies where there was a co-intervention in the experimental group such as a dietary alteration or counselling that was not also applied to the control group.<BR/>Studies where the same diet was applied to both the intervention group and the control group and hence the exercise in the intervention group was the only difference between the two groups, were not excluded.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-10-03 14:55:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The participants were males and females with type 2 diabetes. Ideally, the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus should have been described in the trial. To be consistent with changes in classification and diagnostic criteria of diabetes through the years, the diagnosis should have been established using the standard criteria valid at the beginning of the trial. Acceptable diagnostic criteria included those described by: the National Diabetes Data Group standards (<LINK REF="REF-NDDG-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDDG 1979</LINK>), the World Health Organisation standards (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>) or the American Diabetes Association standards (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997b</LINK>). The major difference between the different standards is that the ADA cutoff point for diabetes is a fasting blood glucose level of equal to or more than 7.0 mmol/L whereas the other two standards use a cutoff of equal to or more than 7.8 mmol/L. Changes in diagnostic criteria may have produced variation in the clinical characteristics of the people included in trials as well as in the results obtained.</P>
<P>Studies performed on people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were not included in the analysis. Where studies reported the combined results for people with type 2 diabetes and IGT, we contacted the authors requesting individual data. If these data were not provided, the trial was excluded.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 23:56:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The included studies prescribed an exercise intervention, defined as a pre-determined program of physical activity. Physical activity can comprise any body movement produced by skeletal muscle, resulting in an increase in energy expenditure. In contrast, exercise prescriptions include specific recommendations for the type, intensity, frequency and duration of physical activity with a specific objective (that is, increase fitness or health) (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1994</LINK>). Studies that stated they simply recommended increasing physical activity were not included in the analyses unless it was possible to quantify the exercise stimulus.</P>
<P>We intended to measure the effect of exercise, hence only included studies where the only difference in interventions between groups was exercise. Using this inclusion criteria, studies involving dietary or medication changes were eligible for inclusion only when the same treatments were applied to both the control and intervention groups. The review includes studies involving three types of intervention:</P>

<P>This review focused on clinically important outcomes, measured using physiological variables associated with diabetes and its complications. The secondary outcomes hyperinsulinaemia dyslipidaemia and hypertension are also associated with cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Despr_x00e9_s-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Després 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamarche-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamarche 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yki_x002d_Yarvinen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yki-Yarvinen 1998</LINK>).

<P>Variations in data extraction were resolved by consensus, referring back to the original data.</P>
<P>We contacted three authors, two for clarification and one to request raw data.</P>
<P>When data were available only in graph form, the best estimate of the mean and SD was obtained. When post-intervention measures of dispersion (SD, SEM or 95% CI) were not available (for example when post-intervention information was expressed as percentage change from baseline values) the measure of dispersion at baseline was used as the post-intervention value. However, this extrapolation was only performed when other pre- and post- measures of dispersion were similar for the same outcomes in other trials. Variation at baseline should be greater than at post-intervention, hence any such replacement should be conservative.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:40:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The methodological quality of each included randomised controlled trial was assessed independently by two authors (DT and GN), based on quality criteria specified by Schultz and Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>). The following factors were studied:<BR/>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was the analysis by intention-to treat?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of detection bias - were the outcome assessors blind to the intervention?<BR/>Blinding of the people administering the intervention, as well as the participants actually doing the exercise is impossible in exercise intervention trials, so only the blinding of outcome assessors was assessed.<BR/>
<BR/>We had planned a sensitivity analysis based on classification of the studies into three categories (<I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>):<BR/>A - low risk of bias: all quality criteria met;<BR/>B - moderate risk of bias: one or more of the quality criteria only partially met;<BR/>C - high risk of bias: one or more quality criteria not met, as well as exploring the effect of the individual quality criteria. However, as there were insufficient data, this was not done.</P>
<P>We assessed each trial independently for quality, and for any differences of opinion we had planned to calculate the level of inter-rater agreement using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>), resolving the differences by discussion. However, there was no disagreement on quality assessment.</P>

<BR/>For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) between the post-intervention values of the intervention and control groups were used to analyse the size of the intervention effects.

<P>All data were initially analysed with a fixed effect model. We tested for heterogeneity between trial results using a standard chi-squared test to observe whether any variation in study results was compatible with the variation expected by chance alone. A significance level of alpha = 0.1 was used for the test of heterogeneity. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>parameter was used to quantify any inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP> = [(Q-df)] x 100%, where Q is the chi-squared statistic and df is its degrees of freedom) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>Three authors were contacted for further information. Professor Sato was contacted for clarification on whether the participants had been randomised in the <LINK REF="STD-Yamanouchi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanouchi 1995</LINK> study . We received a rapid response, confirming that the trial had been a<B> </B>controlled clinical trial<B> </B>and randomisation had not been possible under the circumstances. We also contacted <LINK REF="STD-Bogardus-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bogardus 1984</LINK>, to ask if they had separate data for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) participants, since these are combined in the paper and impaired glucose tolerance was one of our exclusion criteria. We received an efficient response informing us that no raw data for this trial were available. These studies are included in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:43:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>From the initial search, 2101 records were identified, and from these, 98 full papers were identified for further examination. The other studies were excluded on the basis of their abstracts because they were not relevant to the question under study. Main reasons for exclusion were: exercise was not the sole intervention, articles were reviews, studies did not compare similar groups, (for example only one group had type 2 diabetes, all participants did not have type 2 diabetes, or participants with type 2 diabetes were indistinguishable from those with impaired glucose tolerance), the intervention was less than eight weeks, the paper was on prevention rather than treatment of type 2 diabetes or the study had no control group, no randomisation, or else insufficient data were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1987</LINK>).

<P>All final 14 studies selected for the review were randomised controlled trials. They were conducted in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Cuff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cuff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>), Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>), Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>), France (<LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>), Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>), Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>), New Zealand (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2003</LINK>), and USA (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>). The duration of the interventions ranged from eight weeks in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>) to one study using six months (<LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>). One trial had a post-intervention follow-up at 12 months after the end of the 12 week intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>). Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>) reported data from a one-year follow-up, but not as the exercise group versus the control group, rather as the self-reporting of exercise from all the participants available in the trial. The shorter studies mainly involved progressive resistance training (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>) and the exercise prescription in longer studies tended to involve moderate aerobic exercise such as walking (<LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>) or cycling (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>) or controlled endurance training combined with muscle strength training (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration</HEADING>
<P>Exercise interventions ranged from eight weeks duration (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>) to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>) reported post-intervention follow-up results, Raz et al at six months after the end of the six month intervention and Wing et al at 12 months post-intervention. The most common duration of the intervention was either eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>) or 16 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Cuff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cuff 2003</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>). In two studies the intervention was 10 weeks, (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>), in two studies over 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>) and in one study over 24 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>). One intervention lasted 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The duration of individual exercise sessions varied from at least 30 minutes for resistance training (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>) to 120 minutes for a Qi Gong program (<LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>). Approximately 60 minutes duration per exercise session was cited in seven studies. The number of weekly sessions in the interventions varied from one (<LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>) to seven (<LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>). Individual details are provided in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK> study had a design that enabled two sets of comparison groups within the one study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Frequency</HEADING>
<P>Most interventions involved three sessions per week with exercise occurring on non-consecutive days. This accords with recovery and adaptation principles of exercise programming. One recent study using Qi Gong involved one two-hour session per week (<LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>). Two studies required participants to complete one unsupervised session in addition to the three (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>) or two (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>) sessions supervised by researchers. Compliance with exercise five or more times per week was required in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>). One of these five weekly sessions studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>) was home-based rather than community based with compliance monitored using hidden counters on the cycle ergometers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of exercise</HEADING>
<P>The studies in this systematic review included various types of exercise interventions, both resistance and aerobic based. In some of the studies using aerobic training programmes, a choice of aerobic activities was made available to participants (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>). In some trials, additional unsupervised exercise sessions were also included (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>). In one study, the use of hidden counters on the cycle ergometers was a novel way of supervision and effectively measured compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>). In the studies using progressive resistance training, the loads imposed in recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>) were higher than in other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>). Usually loads are lighter for the first two weeks, after which they are increased (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>). In some studies, re-assessment of progression in resistance training programmes was routine (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>). In other trials, progression was determined on an individual goal attainment basis (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>). Detailed descriptions of the exact resistance training regimes used in more recent studies mean that these could be accurately duplicated (<LINK REF="STD-Cuff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cuff 2003</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>). One study provided the control group with short supervised stretching regimes (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intensity of exercise intervention</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally interventions were either progressive resistance training (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>) or moderate aerobic training (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>). Longer trials involved combinations of progressive resistance and at least some aerobic training (<LINK REF="STD-Cuff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cuff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>). Progressive resistance training prescriptions have been described with increasing accuracy over the past two decades and more recent studies describe the precise regime and duration of intervals between sets as well as the frequency of re-testing during the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cuff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cuff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Percentage of the maximal oxygen uptake (<LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>), peak oxygen uptake (<LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>), or peak heart rate (<LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>) were scales used to define the percentage effort required in the interventions. Exercise modalities included continuous and intermittent cycling (<LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>), progressive increases in walking (<LINK REF="STD-Dela-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dela 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>) and mixed aerobic sessions of running, cycling, skiing, and swimming (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:50:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>An exercise intervention resulted in a clinically significantly improvement in glycaemic control compared to controls. The decrease of 0.6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> (13 trials) was achieved over relatively short periods of time, since the shortest studies in the review were of eight weeks duration (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maiorana-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maiorana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mourier 1997</LINK>) and there were only two studies with an intervention of six months or more (<LINK REF="STD-Dunstan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dunstan 2002</LINK>) (six months) and (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>) (twelve months). Analysis of sub-groups showed a trend to the shorter trials producing a slightly more pronounced improvement in glycaemic control (-0.8% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> for studies of three months or less and -0.7% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> for all studies less than six months), compared to -0.6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> for all thirteen trials. This probably reflects both the higher intensity of the exercise in some of the shorter trials, as well as the difficulties of maintaining compliance with exercise regimes in longer term studies. Results from the fourteenth study (<LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>) also support the fact that exercise improved glycemic control. <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK> reported improved glycaemic control in seven of the eight participants in the exercise group, compared to only two out of eight participants in the controls.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that the improvement in glycaemic control can be maintained in the longer term. In the 12 month post-intervention follow-up reported by <LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>, the participants continuing to exercise maintained the improvement in glycaemic control, while the others had not. However, there were large losses to follow-up. In the only other study that reported a 12 month post-intervention follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>), they found that medication for participants in the exercise intervention group was more greatly reduced, than for those in the control group. However for this study also, there were losses to follow-up.</P>
<P>It is generally difficult to motivate people to exercise. A gradual increase in exercise, starting from low intensity and increasing to moderate exercise performed regularly may be a more successful approach to incorporate exercise into daily lives on a long term basis, than introducing more intense levels of exercise at the outset, which will be difficult to maintain in the longer term. The <LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK> study attributed the high rate of compliance in their study partly to the initial low intensity and gradual progression of the exercise, which was individualised for each person. The exercise intervention in this study, which started at low intensity walking and gradually increased to moderate walking or gentle jogging resulted in significantly improved glycaemic control and fitness, and decreased resting systolic blood pressure and fasting triglycerides.</P>
<P>The mean reduction of 0.6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> achieved compares well with reported reductions achieved through medications. Meta-analysis has shown that metformin can lower glycated haemoglobin levels by 0.9% (-0.9% HbA<SUB>1c </SUB>WMD, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.7) compared to placebo, and sulphonylureas have been shown to have a similar effect (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical significance of a 0.6% decrease in glycated haemoglobin can be gauged by studying the large prospective intervention studies examining morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. An epidemiological interpretation of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group data suggests that a 1% rise in glycated haemoglobin represents a 21% increase in risk for any diabetes-related endpoint (95% CI 17 to 24, P &lt; 0.0001), a 21% increase in risk for any diabetes-related death (95% CI 15 to 27, P &lt; 0.0001), a 14% increased risk for myocardial infarction (95% CI 8 to 21, P &lt; 0.0001) and a 37% increased risk for microvascular complications (95% CI 33 to 41, P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>). The group found that there was no threshold value of glycated haemoglobin for any adverse outcome and concluded that any reduction in glycated haemoglobin was likely to reduce the risk of complications, with the lowest risk being in those with normal glycated haemoglobin levels (less than 6%).</P>
<P>The impact of a decrease of 0.6 % HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> equates to a 30% improvement towards a target value of 7% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, and a 20% improvement towards a normal value of 6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, for a person diagnosed with 9% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>. Hence, possible improvements achievable through exercise are not insubstantial.</P>
<P>Improvements in glycaemic control were achieved over a range of exercise intensities. For example, improvements in glycated haemoglobin were observed following low intensity exercise such as a one hour weekly session of Qi Gong (<LINK REF="STD-Tsujiuchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsujiuchi 2002</LINK>), moderate intensity exercise such as walking three times per week at 60 to 79% of maximal oxygen uptake (<LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>) and high intensity exercise regimes that included progressive resistance training of three sets of ten to twelve repetitions of lifting weights that represented 70 to 85% of a maximum voluntary contraction load of a muscle group (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the decrease in glycated haemoglobin, there was also a significant decrease in fat mass and in visceral adipose tissue, thus exercise is contributing to decreasing one of the major risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. Despite the decrease in fat, there was no decrease in body mass and this probably reflects a significant increase in fat free mass or muscle mass. Participants in the exercise group are likely to have developed muscle, which is heavier than adipose tissue. In the early stages of an exercise programme, an increase in muscle mass would obscure any weight loss due to adipose tissue loss. Over time muscle mass does not keep increasing to the same extent as adipose tissue loss and eventually weight loss occurs due to loss of adipose tissue. The length of most of the included trials was too short to show change in body mass. Interventions for sustained weight change require durations of up to one year.</P>
<P>There was also a significant lowering of plasma triglycerides in the exercise intervention group compared with the controls, but there was no significant difference between groups in either total cholesterol or blood pressure. However, one study, not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Yeater-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yeater 1990</LINK>), did report a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure with exercise.</P>
<P>In the one study reporting insulin response, there was increased insulin sensitivity in the exercise intervention group, which would contribute to improved glycaemic control. However, it was observed in another study that no benefits could be expected in patients who already had poor metabolic control and weak insulin reserves (<LINK REF="STD-Ronnemaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ronnemaa 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality of life did not decrease when exercise sessions were included as reported in the study addressing quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Tessier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tessier 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no serious adverse effects reported as a result of any of the exercise interventions and no hypoglycaemic reactions or development of diabetic complications were reported in any of the trials in the exercise group. No trial aimed to observe mortality, due to the restricted study periods.</P>
<P>These results show a need to be process (engagement) rather than product (weight loss) focussed. In several studies, despite the lack of weight loss, good compliance and programme design resulted in lifestyle, biochemical, biological and other systemic benefits in people with type 2 diabetes. Feedback to people about these other important health outcomes may improve exercise adherence and hence the sustainability of the intervention. Variety, with a choice of the exercise activity, may also be important to ensure compliance with exercise programmes beyond the period of the intervention.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We identified fourteen randomised controlled trials (377 participants) which assessed exercise against no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes. These studies involved either aerobic or resistance training exercise interventions or a combination of both of these. The studies were conducted in nine different countries. Participants included both male and female adults of mean age over 45 years, hence the results particularly apply to the age group at most risk for type 2 diabetes.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:51:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Most studies included in this review were well-designed, even though there are some methodological limitations, some of which may be due to reporting standards prevalent in the year in which the study was performed. While all the included studies were reported as randomised, few reported the method of randomisation, or allocation concealment. However, in some of these studies, the same participants took part in both the intervention and control arms of the study. No study reported blinding of outcome assessors. Analyses for the results were not always performed on an intention-to-treat basis, however most studies reported on the reasons why people had dropped out of the study.</P>
<P>The length of trials prevented the reporting of any significant long term complications or mortality. Another limitation of the review was the small number of participants included in the analyses for visceral and subcutaneous adiposity, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, fat free mass and quality of life.</P>
<P>Exercise prescriptions are difficult for many people to maintain over the longer term. The longest study in this review was 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Loimaala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Loimaala 2003</LINK>), with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Raz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raz 1994</LINK>) having a one year post-intervention follow-up and another study (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988b</LINK>) reporting a one year general post-intervention follow-up, but not comparing the participants according to their original randomised groups. It is possible that the length of the trials included in the review was not sufficient to result in any loss in total body mass, even though a decrease in visceral adipose tissue was reported. Longer term trials are needed to evaluate whether long term exercise maintains the improved glycaemic control. Inclusion of regular exercise into daily routines requires a lifestyle change that could be justified, if long term trials demonstrated compliance and longer term benefits such as decreased rates of diabetic complications.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review found that exercise per se significantly decreased glycated haemoglobin levels (by 0.6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>), and hence improved glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus to a clinically significant degree. For a person diagnosed with a glycated haemoglobin value of 9% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, this represents a 30% improvement towards a target glycated haemoglobin value of 7% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, and a 20% improvement towards a normal value of 6% HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>. Hence, possible improvements achievable through exercise are not insubstantial.</P>
<P>Thus, exercise can be recommended in the management of type 2 diabetes, and can lead to amelioration of the diabetes. This can benefit the patient, by either lessening or even avoiding the requirement for medication. Adverse effects were neither stated as outcomes, nor reported for the intervention group, in any of the studies.</P>
<P>The significant improvement in glycaemic control, increase in insulin sensitivity and increase in fat free mass, and decrease in visceral adipose tissue, even though overall body mass did not decrease, is good feedback with a patient focus to enable discussion of benefits not necessarily seen on body weight scales. </P>
<P>Because the included studies had interventions involving different types of exercise, the most suitable type of exercise can be individually determined for a person, so as provide an acceptable low cost, convenient mode of activity. The easier the exercise is to maintain, the more likely it is that people will do it. Therefore, mild to moderate exercise performed regularly will be of more benefit, than short bursts of high intensity exercise, which would be difficult to maintain over long periods.</P>
<P>Dedicated exercise regimes should be prescribed in addition to lifestyle-based incidental types of activities for everyday life, such as cycling rather than using the car. Other examples of these incidental activities are taking the stairs rather than the lift, using facilities on different levels in multi-storey buildings, parking the car further away and carrying groceries rather than pushing them in a cart. A baseline sedentary population appears likely to gain health benefits from multiple opportunities to increase energy expenditure.</P>
<P>Interventions in which the exercise prescription involved a variety of activities were as effective as those interventions using a single mode of exercise. A variety of exercise types may thus be the key to making exercise more acceptable to people, increasing the sustainability of the exercise so as to obtain longer term health benefits. Programmes using a single mode of exercise may become too monotonous over long periods of time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As there is some evidence that the improvement in glycaemic control can be maintained in the longer term, further studies with longer exercise interventions and with post-intervention follow-ups of at least six to twelve months are required to assess whether exercise prescriptions can be maintained as part of a regular lifestyle. Long term intervention studies would be useful to determine whether the participants can continue with the exercise prescription and also whether the decrease in glycated haemoglobin and consequent improved glycaemic control is maintained over longer periods, as well as whether body mass eventually decreases.<BR/> <BR/>Variables that appear to be under-explored are exercise-related improvements in primary outcomes with a strong patient focus, including quality of life, attitudes to diabetes and overall cardiorespiratory health. With the increasing trend towards type 2 diabetes appearing at younger ages, even during childhood, there is a need for studies in these younger age groups. There is also a further need for studies with enough power and duration to detect effects for outcomes such as long term complications of diabetes.</P>

<P>We acknowledge expert diabetes advice from Associate Professor C Cowell, Head, Department of Endocrinology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead; contribution to the protocol by Mr. N Boule, Dr E Haddad, Dr G Kenny, Dr G Wells and Dr R Sigal, and thank Professor Y Sato, Dr C Bogardus and Dr P Boudou for responding to our queries. Dr Boudou kindly confirmed our deduction that both Boudou 2001 and Mourier 1997 belong to the same study, hence these two papers have been grouped together under Mourier 1997.</P>

<P>Papers excluded (n = 63)<BR/>After full papers had been retrieved and assessed, those on prevention, those with co-interventions, or in which the type 2 diabetes participants were indistinguishable from insulin impaired or normo-glycaemic participants, were excluded. Main reasons for exclusion were: exercise was not the sole intervention, articles were reviews, studies did not compare similar groups, e.g. only one group had type 2 diabetes, all participants did not have type 2 diabetes, the intervention was less than eight weeks, the paper was on prevention rather than treatment of type 2 diabetes, the study had no control group or the study had no randomisation<BR/>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>RCTs excluded from meta-analysis (n = 21)<BR/>Reasons: information provided by authors resulted in exclusion for this review, e.g. data for participants with impaired glucose tolerance could not be separated from those with diabetes type 2; control group intervention included exercise also; one had 6 weeks of supervised exercise, and thereafter 'encouraged by phone'; diet co-intervention was used, trial was not randomised, or insufficient data were provided<BR/>
