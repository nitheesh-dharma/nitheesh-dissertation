See additional amendments below in italic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W's notes 04/06/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - did you mean studies awaiting classification instead of 'excluded but relevant'? &lt;i&gt;Sorry, yes I did mean studies awaiting classification. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add goncalves to acknowledgments for providing raw data. &lt;i&gt;Added.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris, stats check - delete the following sentence: &amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Subjects in the exercise group experienced a clinically significant though statistically non-significant mean improvement in asthma control of 0.22 over the study period compared to a mean change of 0.73 in the sedentary control group&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot; and add &amp;quot;t&lt;b&gt;here was no significant difference in asthma control between the groups&amp;quot;.&lt;/b&gt; This comes from the paper, but the trial was testing the difference between groups NOT whether each individual mean change was significantly different from baseline (either clinically or statistically). &lt;i&gt;Amended. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma notes 24/02/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest not pooling PEFR as I2=96%. I have written this in the abstract so better make sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC August 24th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Kristen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This looks much better. I will pass it on to Emma on her return next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC August 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for amending this update. I have made some edits to the document. The SoF quality relates to Risk of Bias, Imprecision and so on, and this all needs to be entered into Grade Pro with reasons for downgrading. Lack of blinding might lead to a downgrade of all subjective outcomes for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective reporting is not currently satisfactory. The question is not whether data can be used in RevMan, but whether data was measured and then not reported in the paper. The risk of bias tables and this section of the text need revision. Might help to refer to the handbook on this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the review is getting on well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC additional comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small trial size is not a risk of bias (see Handbook 8.15) please review highlighted text in RoB tables. Done Generalisability is also not part of RoB so please take mention of this out of the ROB tables. Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How does the P value of the symptom-free days in Mendes compare to that in RevMan? Your imputed SD is much smaller than the other study, which needs explanation? Emma - think about whether of not you mistakenly entered the SE. You can fiddle about on RevMan by entering in different SDs until the confidence intervals match that of the published paper. Emma, not sure what to comment on here. Do you have any suggestions? Otherwise I will organise a meeting with Prof Esterman (our statistician) to discuss further. FYI Mendes paper reports P&amp;lt;0.001; RevMan meta-analysis P&amp;lt;0.00001; &lt;/span&gt;We think that you should discuss this with your statistician. If the P value you get from the imputed SD is thi different from the reported P value, then it is likely that your imputed P value is wrong.&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;As per previous correspondence, this has been discussed with Adrian Esterman and he re-assessed the analysis, however due to the possible duplication of subjects between studies this outcome is no longer being meta-analysed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surely the best way to describe PEFR is that there was a significant benefit in one study and not in the other, and we do not know why! - Has been amended to include 'unknown reason' however we would like to keep the 'possible reasons' sentence as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEV1 is not significantly different but the 95% CI is not tight enough to rule out a difference. Has been reworded - please check this is ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 12/05/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have left in quite a few of my tracked changes for style. I normally don't do this, but since Kristin is involved in so many reviews, I thought it might be helpful to see what kinds of changes we make to style. Once you have finished looking at the tracked changes, please accept them all and carry on editing your review. Thanks Emma, very useful for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I think this is a bit colloquial and doesn't have much meaning to me! &amp;quot;Patients with asthma should be able to participate in regular physical activity.&amp;quot; Can you revise thi sentence please. Revised, please check it is ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- When you say more research is needed in the plain language summary, isn't it better to suggest that it makes sense for people to undertakes some sort of physical exercise if they can manage this without making themselves ill as in general people should take exercise so they remain fit and healthy? The exercise may not have an effect on asthma outcomes, but presumably it is good for their overall well being and it would be sad if this review was used by people to avoid exercise as there isn't 'enough' research. (by doing this you are really only referring to this idea from the background &amp;quot;Thus a number of studies (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Clark 1988&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Clark 1988&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Garfinkel 1992&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Garfinkel 1992&lt;/a&gt;), but not all (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Santuz 1997&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Santuz 1997&lt;/a&gt;), have reported asthmatics to have lower cardiorespiratory fitness than their peers.&amp;quot;) Agree, revised please the revision is appropriate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assesment of reporting biases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - You should put what you had planned to do here, not describe the number of studies that were included etc ( which you should include in the results section). As the text in this paragraph was conflicting, I could not rewrite this for you. Please change this paragraph to something along the lines of: we planned to assess reporting biases by visual inspection of a funnel plot if we were able to pool ten or more studies in a single meta-analysis. (then you can put the bit about not being able to perform an inspection of a funnel plot/inspecting it under the heading &amp;quot;Overall completeness and applicability of evidence&amp;quot; in the discussion. Agree, now reworded in addition to sentences added to the discussion. You highlighted in text that this should be recorded under 'Quality of the evidence' heading, but here you suggest 'Overal... etc' I have put it under the quality section, but happy to move it. &lt;span&gt;That's great thanks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you define classification in the following sentence: Subgroup analysis would have been performed for each classification of intervention if a sufficient number of included studies had been available. Do you mean swimming vs running etc? You could perhaps put this in parenthesis after the word classification, but do try to quantify this please. (e.g., swimming, running) Parenthesis added with examples of classification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of bias.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I have added some text using tracked changes to explain your judgement to a reader that does not fancy scrolling down the review to try and work out at what risk of bias you determined each study to have. Can you please add a little more information throughout this section? More information added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I am not sure I understand what this sentence means &amp;quot;Selective reporting was inadequate in eight studies &amp;quot; you could say: we could not exclude the possibility of selective outcome reporting in eight studies. Reworded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. What do you think that the other sources of bias were in the two studies for which this could not be excluded? This sounds a bit ominous, but is essentially meaningless to the reader without more detail! More detail provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you please provide an upto date reference and link it in the text to National Heart, Lung and Blood Intitute Criteria; Done, but the link is for 2011. The context in which the reference was used predates 2009. Is this still okay?&lt;span&gt; emma: yes I think this is fine - readers should realise that the trialists couldn't have based their diagnoses on future guidelines, but they should still be directed to the latest version so that they are not being mislead about the most upto date treatment recommendation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you please have a look at your assessment of heterogeneity throughout. For HRmax you said there was significant heterogeneity (I2=38%), but for other outcomes you said there was no heterogeneity when it was actually 48% in some cases. Paragraph has been adjusted with the correct reports of heterogeneity in the appropriate context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was the reason for excluding the Counil study as a sensitivity analysis? Counil was excluded following visual inspection of the analysis (see figure in e-mail). &lt;span&gt;The Forest plot indicated that heterogeneity was due to one outlying study. According to pre-specified methods, sensitivity analysis was conducted on studies with high or unclear risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. Removal of the Counil study from the analysis removed the significant heterogeneity. I can add the Counil study back in and discuss the sensitivity analysis in text rather than showing the analysis excluding Counil if you think this would be better. Emma - I think that Van Veldhoven should also be removed as it is at unclear risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. I added in a figure (a risk of bias graph) which makes this clearer. &lt;b&gt;Done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned of the totals for comparison 1.10, 6MWD as there is only one study contributing to this 'meta-analysis'. Agreed, thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I activated some of the headings in the discussion. You may have already thought about this and decided not to use them, but if you have not, could you please reconsider reordering the discussion? We had considered this and decided not to use the headings, however I have restructured the discussion under three of the five headings to make it clearer. Otherwise, I would have to re-write the discussion to find more information for the other two headings. Hope this is okay. Emma - &lt;span&gt;Sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;CJC July 21st&lt;br&gt;Thanks Felix,&lt;br&gt;The what's new section is very clear and will help readers who want to know what new data has been found. I have added date of last search to the abstract and copied over the new study details from the what's new section to results.&lt;br&gt;I am happy for this to progress now.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;FSFR July 5, 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See reponses IN CAPS below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=========================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Edit by CJC June 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: Please complete this section with the names of the new studies, number of participants and whether the results or conclusions have changed. DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine. Were any details provided for those studies labelled adequate allocation concealment to indicate that once the group was chosen the participant could not then withdraw. This is important as blinding is not possible in this intervention. NO SUCH DETIALS PROVIDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Date of last search needs adding please. 10 MAY 2005, SEE DATES UNDER &amp;quot;WHAT'S NEW&amp;quot; ALSO ADDED IN TEXT NOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: fine, but significant added where needed and p values replaced with Confidence intervals. The heterogeneous outcomes are not significant when pooled using a random model of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: please return to Felix to complete the what's new section, add date of last search and add the details of the update to the results section. (EG how many abstracts, how many excluded, details of new studies found - I assume none were blinded). Then this can progress for the next submission.&lt;br&gt;Thanks fo r updating the review,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==============================================&lt;br&gt;16/05/2005: updated version of review submitted by FSFR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five additional studies included in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;Short title (no longer in use): Physical training in asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16/9/99 check by CJC&lt;br&gt;No contribution of reviewers text. The references have not transferred properly and the other authors have all drifted into the title field. These need cut and pasting into the correct lines. The format of the id of included studies is odd and should be in the form Cates 1999 (not 16,Sly), but as there are no links to the studies in the text this can be amended later.&lt;br&gt;The Metaview graphs can be labelled to show the direction of benefit of the treatment. See following:RevMan 4 allows the author of the review to select individual Metaview graph labels for each OUTCOME and to force the reader to see a particular statistical analysis for each outcome when they open up Metaview on the Cochrane Library. If you wish to change these settings, which are currently no labels and Peto OR, WMD as default stats then do the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you open up the comparisons table and single click on one of the outcomes you can then press the edit button at the top of the screen. This opens a new window with 3 tabs. The GENERAL tab shows what you have called this outcome and the labels for the experimental and control interventions which show at the top of a Metaview graph; these should not need to be changed. If you look at the STATISTICAL tab you can set the default statistic for that outcome (currently Peto for dichotomous and WMD for continuous data.) If you wish you can change the scale and you can set labels for the bottom of the meta-view graph for that outcome by looking under the GRAPH tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is useful if you want to force the reader to see SMD instead of WMD for an outcome when they open metaview, or if some outcomes are adverse and some not, in which case the labels in the GRAPH section will be the opposite way round for good outcomes : (&amp;quot;Treatment better&amp;quot; on the left and &amp;quot;Placebo better&amp;quot; on the right for good outcomes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do nothing at all the default stat will stay as Peto and WMD and there will be no labels at the bottom of the Metaview graphs.&lt;br&gt;CJC check 3/10/99&lt;br&gt;This looks great and ready for ModMan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: ++Physical training for asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: Physical training for asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Physical training for asthma UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 160505)&lt;br&gt;Old title: ++Physical training for asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Physical training for asthma UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 160505)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-09-11 17:08:18 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="PTR-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.6 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

Twenty-five studies were added to the excluded studies list. Maximum expiratory ventilation is now significantly better with physical training. This is in line with the increases previously seen in cardiopulmonary fitness as measured by increases in maximum oxygen uptake.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some people with asthma may show less tolerance to exercise due to worsening asthma symptoms when they exercise or other reasons such as deconditioning. This can prevent them playing sports or attempting to keep fit. Physical training programs for people with asthma have been designed to improve physical fitness, muscle coordination and confidence.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that exercise training (including running, gymnastics, cycling, swimming, weights and walking) was well tolerated among the study participants. This review also found that physical training improved cardiopulmonary fitness and showed some positive effects for health-related quality of life. However, physical training had no significant effect on resting lung function. In summary, people with stable asthma should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise training that is within their capacity without fear of worsening of their asthma symptoms.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with asthma may show less tolerance to exercise due to worsening asthma symptoms during exercise or other reasons such as deconditioning as a consequence of inactivity. Some may restrict activities as per medical advice or family influence and this might result in reduced physical fitness. Physical training programs aim to improve physical fitness, neuromuscular coordination and self confidence. Subjectively, many people with asthma report that they are symptomatically better when fit, but results from trials have varied and have been difficult to compare because of different designs and training protocols. Also, as exercise can induce asthma, the safety of exercise programmes needs to be considered.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>Twenty-one studies (772 participants) were included in this review with two additional 2012 studies identified as 'awaiting classification'. Physical training was well tolerated with no adverse effects reported. None of the studies mentioned worsening of asthma symptoms following physical training. Physical training showed marked improvement in cardiopulmonary fitness as measured by a statistically and clinically significant increase in maximum oxygen uptake (mean difference (MD) 4.92 mL/kg/min; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.98 to 5.87; P &lt; 0.00001; 8 studies on 267 participants); however, no statistically significant effects were observed for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), minute ventilation at maximal exercise (VEmax) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Meta-analysis of four studies detected a statistically significant increase in maximum heart rate, and following a sensitivity analysis and removal of two studies significance was maintained (MD 3.67 bpm; 95% CI 0.90 to 3.44; P = 0.01). Although there were insufficient data to pool results due to diverse reporting tools, there was some evidence to suggest that physical training may have positive effects on health-related quality of life, with four of five studies producing a statistically and clinically significant benefit.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jo Picot">
<P>This review demonstrated that physical training showed significant improvement in maximum oxygen uptake, though no effects were observed in other measures of pulmonary function. Physical training was well tolerated among people with asthma in the included studies and, as such, people with stable asthma should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise training, without fear of symptom exacerbation. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which physical activity impacts asthma management.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-11 17:07:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jo Picot">
<P>Asthma, a chronic respiratory condition affecting 300 million people globally (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>), causes inflammation of the lungs as well as structural and functional remodelling of the airways. It is characterised by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing with varying degrees of frequency and severity, which is caused by swelling of the bronchial tubes resulting in airflow limitation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Although the causes of asthma are not completely understood, risk factors are known to include inhaling asthma triggers such as allergens, tobacco smoke and chemical irritants. Asthma is incurable and the prevalence is increasing, particularly in children and young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Pawankar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawankar 2012</LINK>), however appropriate management can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy a high quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma is estimated to account for one in every 250 deaths worldwide, many of which are preventable (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of asthma varies between countries, with prevalence estimates of 18.4% in Scotland, 15.3% in England, 15.1% in New Zealand, 14.1% in Canada, 11.4% in Brazil, 10.9% in the United States of America, 9% in Israel, 8.1% in South Africa, 6.9% in Germany, 6.7% in Japan, 4.5% in Italy, 3.8% in Bangladesh, 2.6% in Taiwan, 2.3% in Switzerland, 1.9% in Greece and 1.1% in Indonesia (<LINK REF="REF-EFA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>). Asthma is reported to be the 10th leading contributor to the overall burden of disease in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2010</LINK>), affecting 14.7% of all Australians (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>) and as such it has been a National Health Priority since 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2008</LINK>). Globally, the healthcare costs associated with asthma management are significant and increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Bahadori-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadori 2009</LINK>), with estimated costs in developed countries estimated at USD 300 to USD 1300 per patient per year (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>) and EUR 1583 per patient in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Accordini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Accordini 2013</LINK>). With the healthcare burden of asthma increasing, confounding pressures are applied to healthcare systems, governments, families and the patients themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Masoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masoli 2004</LINK>) resulting in sub-optimal management (<LINK REF="REF-Kandane_x002d_Rathayake-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandane-Rathayake 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jo Picot">
<P>Physical activity is comprised of bodily movements produced by the skeletal muscles that result in an increased metabolic rate over that of resting energy expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 2012</LINK>). Physical training is defined by one 2012 publication as "... a form of leisure-time physical activity that is usually performed repeatedly over an extended period of time (exercise training) with a specific external objective such as the improvement of fitness, physical performance, or health" (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 2012</LINK>). For the purpose of improving health outcomes the mode, intensity, frequency and duration of activities need to be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 2012</LINK>). Physical training programmes have been designed for people with asthma with the aim of improving physical fitness (<LINK REF="STD-Arandelovic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arandelovic 2007</LINK>), neuromuscular coordination and self confidence, but the reported results have varied and have been difficult to compare because of different study designs and training protocols. Such protocols can include various types of aerobic exercise such as running, jogging, cycling, weight training, swimming, stretching and a combination of these activities amongst many other options (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A low level of habitual physical activity leads in turn to low levels of physical fitness. Thus a number of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garfinkel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garfinkel 1992</LINK>), but not all (<LINK REF="REF-Santuz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santuz 1997</LINK>), have reported people with asthma to have lower cardiorespiratory fitness when compared to their peers. For people with asthma, exercise can provoke bronchoconstriction in some individuals resulting in exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Research has also shown that inactivity as a result of breathlessness can lead to peripheral muscle deconditioning, which is an important factor limiting exercise capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Allard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laveneziana-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laveneziana 2006</LINK>).This is because deconditioning can result in further breathlessness, as atrophied leg muscles for example are more prone to fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Swallow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swallow 2007</LINK>), requiring increased ventilation for exercise to be maintained. Subsequently, this contributes to breathlessness in a spiraling cycle finally resulting in exercise avoidance and therefore further deconditioning of the skeletal muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Moxham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxham 2009</LINK>). Studies have shown that people with asthma are able to exercise and improve their fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Scichilone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scichilone 2012</LINK>), and that limitations in exercise capacity can sometimes relate more to lack of fitness than to air flow limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Sonna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonna 2001</LINK>). Habitual physical activity is associated with a reduction in asthma prevalence in children (<LINK REF="REF-Nystad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nystad 2001</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Huovinen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huovinen 2001</LINK>), and may lower the minute ventilation of mild and moderate exercise thereby reducing the likelihood of provoking EIA; whilst physical inactivity has been associated with negative health consequences and an increase in asthma-related difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>). Exercise training may also reduce the perception of breathlessness through a number of mechanisms including strengthening respiratory muscles. There are reports that exercise may have a protective effect against asthma development by reducing airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Eijkemans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkemans 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2002</LINK>) and increasing the patency of bronchioles (<LINK REF="REF-Eijkemans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkemans 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:35:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regular physical exercise and participation in sports are considered to be important components in the overall management of asthma, especially in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1996</LINK>). There is some evidence to suggest that regular physical exercise improves asthma symptom management, lung function and mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>). However, there is evidence that some people with asthma may avoid participation in exercise and sports due to shortness of breath or worsening asthma symptoms during exercise, or fear of experiencing such symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2013b</LINK>). Some may have a negative attitude to exercise due to reasons including organisational policies, family beliefs, healthcare advice or inaccurate symptom perception (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>). Subjectively, many people with asthma report that they are symptomatically better when fit but the physiological basis of this perception has not been systematically investigated.</P>

We addressed missing standard deviations by imputing data from the studies within the same meta-analysis or from a different meta-analysis providing these used the same measurement scale, had the same degree of measurement error and the same time periods between baseline and final value measurement (as per chapter 16.1.3.2 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Where statistics essential for analysis were missing (for example group means and standard deviations for both groups were not reported) and could not be calculated from other data, we attempted to contact the authors to obtain the data. We also asked study authors to provide data for unreported outcomes.

If we had found asymmetry in the funnel plots, we planned to include contour lines corresponding to perceived milestones of statistical significance (P = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 etc), which may help to differentiate between asymmetry due to publication bias from that due to other factors (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nine studies reporting results for 315 participants measured asthma symptoms according to different methods (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swann-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Swann 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varray-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varray 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wicher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wicher 2010</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2012</LINK> study reported asthma control as a composite value according to the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire that integrates common indicators of asthma management including the use of bronchodilators, nocturnal symptoms, cough, activity level and pulmonary function. There was no significant difference in asthma control between the groups. One participant in the intervention group did experience an exacerbation during her 12 weeks of exercise, however the authors reported that the exacerbation did not appear to be triggered by the exercise program and that her study data were eventually discarded due to faulty heart rate monitor recordings. Three studies on 151 people (which excluded the known duplications between <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>) reported on frequency of asthma symptoms, which was assessed by monthly sums of days free of asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>). The intervention groups in all three studies showed improvements in symptom free days over the controls; however, following attempts to meta-analyse the data, which suggested that it was not normally distributed, meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves 2008</LINK>: intervention 24.8 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 23 to 27) versus control 15.7 days (95% CI 9 to 21), P &lt; 0.02; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK>, days without symptoms 30 days after study commencement: intervention 21.36 days (95% CI 7 to 27) versus control 14.47 days (95% CI 6 to 24); 60 days after study commencement: intervention 22.71 days (95% CI 11 to 29) versus control 15.51 days (95% CI 10 to 24); 90 days after study commencement: intervention 23.11 days (95% CI 11 to 27) versus control 15.84 days (95% CI 9 to 26), P &lt; 0.001; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>, days without symptoms 30 days after study commencement: intervention 23.17 days (95% CI 20 to 25) versus control 14.63 days (95% CI 10 to 18); 60 days after study commencement: intervention 24.33 days (95% CI 22 to 26) versus control 14.25 days (95% CI 10 to 18); 90 days after study commencement: intervention 24.83 days (95% CI 23 to 27) versus control 15.63 days (95% CI 9 to 21)). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2010</LINK>) reported that asthma control (which was assessed by a six-point score, Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ)) was unchanged in either group during the intervention period, or after three months follow-up post-intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Varray-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varray 1991</LINK> reported that there was no change in frequency of asthma attacks during the intervention period, and the <LINK REF="STD-Swann-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Swann 1983</LINK> trial reported no difference between the two groups for the daily score of asthma symptoms during the study. In the study by Wang (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>), there was a statistically significant improvement in the severity of asthma in the experimental group compared with the control group (daily severity of asthma was monitored at the same time of the day based on National Heart, Lung and Blood Intitute Criteria (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2011</LINK>)). However, this outcome may have been biased by the fact that the intervention group had a greater compliance with controller medications. Authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Wicher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wicher 2010</LINK> study reported that the number of exacerbations for both groups was the same before and during the study, however no numerical data or P values were presented.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:50:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review examined the effects of physical training on people with asthma. Twenty-one randomised controlled trials satisfied the inclusion criteria, with the majority of the studies including small numbers of participants. Although all studies met the inclusion criteria they differed significantly in terms of intervention characteristics (including frequency, duration and type of intervention), reported outcomes and statistical presentation of data. The statistical presentation of results was a particular issue and limited the analysis as data were presented in such a way that they could not be meta-analysed without raw data being obtained (for example median values instead of means, change scores instead of total scores, and percentage predicted instead of absolute values). None of the studies evaluated longer term benefits of physical training in people with asthma.</P>
<P>According to the available data, physical training was well tolerated by the people with asthma with no adverse effects identified. Data from the available studies suggest that physical training improves asthma symptoms. None of the studies detected a worsening of asthma symptoms following physical training. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) was assessed in three studies. However, it was not one of our pre-specified outcomes for this review. Overall, physical training did not seem to change EIB severity.</P>
<P>Physical training improved cardiopulmonary fitness, as measured by an increase in maximum oxygen uptake (VOmax) and the work load achieved by a participant during exercise testing, without having a significant effect on resting lung function. Studies in healthy people have shown that VOmax may increase by up to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1996</LINK>), the extent being dependent upon initial fitness level, type of training and age. Asthma patients respond to physical training in a similar manner and degree to non-asthma participants (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1992</LINK>). Maximum heart rate (HRmax) significantly increased in the group that underwent physical training. A decrease in HRmax is the typical response to training (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1996</LINK>). The present finding may indicate that a maximum effort was not achieved in the baseline test or that non-cardiac factors limited exercise capacity initially. For example, training may result in a decrease in the perception of breathlessness resulting in greater maximum exercise effort.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data to meta-analyse the effects of physical training on health-related quality of life. However, this review does provide some limited evidence from available studies that physical training has positive effects on the quality of life of asthma patients. This may also contribute to other health benefits and improved psychosocial well being. Although these positive effects on quality of life could be a translation of improved cardiopulmonary fitness, further studies are required to evaluate this aspect in detail.</P>

In three out of the four studies that were successful in improving asthma symptoms, exercise was coupled with an asthma education program and breathing exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>). Therefore, the effects seen may represent those of a package of care, rather than exercise alone, although this cannot be definitely proven.</P>
<P>Currently, Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines do not provide recommendations for physical training or exercise therapy for asthma management (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2012</LINK>). It may be appropriate for people with asthma who have stable disease to participate in regular aerobic exercise training programs provided they are educated about prevention and treatment of exercise-induced asthma. This may improve asthma management and reduce the health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:50:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selecting only randomised controlled trials is a trade off, allowing higher quality evidence to be meta-analysed, on which to base future investigations and research. However, this does have the potential of introducing selection bias by excluding relevant studies which do not fulfil the strict criteria for inclusion within the review. In addition, this review, like all others, is potentially susceptible to publication bias, though attempts are made to reduce this as much as possible with the authors searching the relevant databases for published and non-published studies. Despite numerous attempts to contact study authors for raw data, the inability to obtain all relevant information might introduce a bias that has the potential to alter the outcome of the meta-analysis. Biases that occur due to poor reporting of trial methodology may not be adequately accounted for, despite the rigorous assessment by two independent review authors.</P>

<P>There are many studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dogra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dogra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mancuso-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancuso 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2010</LINK>) and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2011</LINK>) now reporting that physical activity does not exacerbate asthma symptoms or compromise asthma control, and associations with improvements in asthma are being observed. Likewise the review by <LINK REF="REF-Eijkemans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkemans 2012</LINK>, focusing on longitudinal studies, indicated that physical activity may produce a protective effect against asthma development and that individuals with higher levels of physical activity may have a lower risk of developing asthma. A 2012 review of asthma and aerobic exercise produced similar findings to this review in that regular aerobic exercise improved asthma symptom management, lung function and mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Avallone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avallone 2012</LINK>). This review included eight studies examining exercise habits, six examining exercise-related symptom perception and physiological responses, and nine looking at aerobic exercise as an intervention for asthma. Overall this empirical evidence also suggested that individuals with asthma are less likely to engage in physical activity than those without asthma; individuals with asthma are not biased in their subjective reporting of symptoms during aerobic exercise and physical inactivity among individuals with asthma has an association with negative health consequences and increased asthma-related difficulties. However, studies examining the mechanisms by which physical training may impact asthma outcomes are lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Eijkemans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkemans 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2013b</LINK>). Some studies included in this review have examined several biological indicators (serum IgE, histamine responsiveness, sputum and serum eosinophil cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels) suggesting that exercise may actually reduce airway inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mendes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wicher-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wicher 2010</LINK>). This paucity of data remains and needs to be addressed in order to advance the understanding of and ability to use physical activity to improve asthma care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:50:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>Physical training can improve cardiopulmonary fitness and may have positive effects on health-related quality of life in patients with asthma. These benefits are unrelated to effects on lung function. This review indicates that physical training is well tolerated in people with asthma. The intervention programmes that produced these benefits included aerobic conditioning using a treadmill, other aerobic exercises and swimming. In three of the four studies that were successful in improving asthma symptoms, exercise was coupled with an asthma education program and breathing exercises. There was no evidence of adverse effects caused by physical training on asthma symptoms. As such we found no reason for people with stable asthma to refrain from regular exercise.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:50:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jo Picot">
<P>There is a need for well conducted randomised controlled trials to assess clinical benefits of physical training in the management of bronchial asthma. The mechanisms by which physical activity impacts asthma remain broadly unknown and further research is required in this area to truly understand the role of exercise in asthma management. Trial sample sizes should be determined before the start of such studies. Specifically, there is a need for further assessment of effects of physical training on asthma symptoms, functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. It may also be beneficial to assess longer term effects (one year or more) of physical training and types of aerobic exercises that are more suitable and safer for people with asthma. The results of randomised trials should be reported following the CONSORT guidelines.</P>

<I>Intervention description: </I>Swimming sessions lasted 60 minutes over a period of three months, twice weekly producing a maximum of 24 lessons; Before exercise children underwent peak expiratory flow to detect any possible bronchial obstruction at time of swimming; This was followed by light stretching exercises, lower and upper limb warm-ups with global postural exercises and awareness of diaphragmatic breathing whilst subjects were lying on mats (approximately 15 minutes); Subjects were then taken to the pool where training was divided by skill level being: Level 1 &#8211; adaptation to the water environment, total immersion breathing, floating/treading water, moving underwater and elementary diving; Level 2 &#8211; Where children had already acquired the aforementioned skills and mastered body control in the water; Lessons included mastering the front crawl and backstroke</P>
<P>
<I>Control description: </I>Control group of non-swimmers</P>
<P>
<I>Duration of intervention: </I>12 weeks</P>

<P>We were unable to pool data for this outcome due to heterogeneity between study populations as per the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic; The results were originally analysed for two of the four studies assessing this outcome using the fixed-effect model, when the random-effects model was applied, the statistical significance disappeared. The minimally important difference is estimated to be a mean change of 11.9 (95% CI 7.3 to 16.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Karras-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karras 2000</LINK>), which has been met in both these analyses. Data from two studies showed no change in PEFR, however, we were unable to combine data due to a high dropout rate in one study and unsuitable data for imputation in the other. Possible sources of clinical heterogeneity include swimming versus gymnasium activities and 6 versus 12 week intervention duration.</P>
