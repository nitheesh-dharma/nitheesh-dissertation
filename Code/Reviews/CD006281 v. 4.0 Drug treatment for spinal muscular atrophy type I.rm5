<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-29 05:10:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disease with onset in childhood and adolescence that results in progressive muscle weakness. There are three main types of SMA. Drug treatment for SMA types II and III is discussed in a separate Cochrane review. The age of onset of SMA type I, also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, is before six months. Children with SMA type I will never be able to sit without support and usually die by the age of two years. It is one of the most important causes of death due to a genetic disease in childhood. There was only one small randomised trial in the original review, which assessed the efficacy of riluzole for 10 children with SMA type I. In this trial all three children in the placebo group died, but three of the seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48 and 64 months. However, none of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to roll, sit or stand. For several reasons the overall quality of the study was low, mainly because the study was too small to detect an effect and there were baseline differences that resulted in risk of bias. Evidence is insufficient to recommend riluzole for SMA type I. No further trials were identified for this 2011 update. No drug treatment has been shown to have significant efficacy for SMA type I.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-29 04:57:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Children with SMA type I will never be able to sit without support and usually die by the age of two years. There are no known efficacious drug treatments that influence the course of the disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-29 04:59:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>To evaluate whether drug treatment is able to slow or arrest the disease progression of SMA type I, and to assess if such therapy can be given safely. Drug treatment for SMA types II and III is the topic of a separate updated Cochrane review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-29 05:00:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (8 March 2011), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1991 to February 2011), EMBASE (January 1991 to February 2011) and ISI Web of Knowledge (January 1991 to 8 March 2011). We searched the Clinical Trials Registry of the U.S. National Institute of Health (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) (8 March 2011) to identify additional trials that had not yet been published.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-13 08:45:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA type I. Participants had to fulfil the clinical criteria and have a deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene (5q11.2-13.2) confirmed by genetic analysis.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was time from birth until death or full time ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were development of rolling, sitting or standing within one year after the onset of treatment, and adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 05:03:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Two authors (RW and AV) independently reviewed and extracted data from all potentially relevant trials. For included studies, pooled relative risks and standardised mean differences were to be calculated to assess treatment efficacy.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-29 05:09:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>One small randomised controlled study comparing riluzole treatment to placebo for 10 SMA type 1 children was identified and included in the original review. No further trials were identified for the update in 2011. Regarding the primary outcome measure, three of seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48 and 64 months, whereas all three children in the placebo group died; but the difference was not statistically significant. Regarding the secondary outcome measures, none of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to roll, sit or stand, and no adverse effects were observed. For several reasons the overall quality of the study was low, mainly because the study was too small to detect an effect and because of baseline differences. Follow-up of the 10 included children was complete.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-29 08:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder of childhood and adolescence with an annual incidence of 1 in 6000 to 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). It is caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells and is clinically manifested by progressive muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 2001</LINK>). Other parts of the peripheral nervous system such as the neuromuscular junction, and possibly the muscle, may also be affected by disruption in maturation and development, which is probably secondary to the deficiency of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cifuentes_x002d_Diaz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifuentes-Diaz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kariya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kariya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The typical pattern of muscle weakness in SMA is weakness of the limbs, which is proximal more than distal, with the lower limbs involved earlier than the upper limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroksmark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroksmark 2001</LINK>). Intercostal muscles also become involved but usually sparing the diaphragm. Survival depends primarily on respiratory function and not necessarily on motor ability (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>). There is often a fine tremor in the fingers (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). Although the face is often spared, tongue fasciculations and facial weakness are not unusual findings (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1993</LINK>). The cognitive function of SMA patients is normal and, at the end of the disease course, there is often a striking discrepancy between alertness and the ability to move (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). There is denervation and reinnervation on electrophysiological examination (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are three main types of SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type I is the most common form, and is also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, acute SMA and infantile-onset SMA. The age of onset is before six months. Children with SMA type I will never be able to sit without support and usually (without intensive supportive care) die by the age of two years (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2008</LINK>). It is characterised by severe progressive muscle weakness and hypotonia (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>). It is one of the most important causes of death due to a genetic disease in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type II is the intermediate type and is also known as intermediate SMA, juvenile SMA and chronic SMA. The age of onset is between six and 18 months. Children with SMA type II develop the ability to sit independently but never become able to walk without support. They often develop severe pulmonary and orthopaedic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>). The children survive beyond two years and may live into adolescence or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA type III is known as Kugelberg-Welander disease, Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease, and mild SMA. The age of onset is after 18 months. Children with SMA type III develop the ability to walk at some time, although many will lose this ability again around puberty. Life expectancy may be normal (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Classification of SMA according to the International SMA Collaboration is based on age of onset, maximal achieved motor function and age of death (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1992</LINK>). Although there are different subtypes, SMA has a broad clinical spectrum. There is overlap between subtypes; there are, for instance, children with SMA who are without the ability to sit but have a relatively long survival time (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>). There are children with SMA I who develop head control and other children with a chronic evolution from the onset. There are children with SMA with disease onset before six months and the ability to sit, and others with disease onset before 18 months and the ability to walk (<LINK REF="REF-Russman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>). The maximum function achieved predicts the natural course of the disease better than the age of onset (<LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russman 1996</LINK>). A very severe type of SMA has been described with onset before birth and death within a few months, known as SMA type 0 or congenital SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>). At the other end of the spectrum, a rare adult form of SMA, known as SMA type IV, has an age of onset after 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>SMA (type 0 to IV) is an autosomal recessive disease and these types of the disease have been mapped to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (<LINK REF="REF-Brzustowicz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brzustowicz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melki-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melki-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>). This chromosomal region contains a duplicate SMN gene, the telomeric SMN gene (SMN1 or SMNt) and the centromeric SMN gene (SMN2 or SMNc) (<LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). The product of the SMN gene is the SMN protein. The SMN1 gene is transcribed into a full-length form, which results in a large amount of stable SMN protein. The SMN2 gene is transcribed into a truncated form lacking exon 7 (90%), which results in an unstable SMN protein without function, and to a lesser extent into a full-length form (10%), which results in a small amount of stable SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lorson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cartegni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartegni 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In SMA, the SMN1 gene is deleted or mutated in 95% to 99% of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2000</LINK>). Consequently, there is no transcription of stable SMN protein from the SMN1 gene and the SMN2 gene is not able to produce enough stable SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Cobben-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). The clinical severity of the disease depends on the amount of SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veldink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veldink 2001</LINK>) and this is related to the number of copies of the SMN2 gene (<LINK REF="REF-Feldkotter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldkotter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harada-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harada 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swoboda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swoboda 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008b</LINK>). Approximately two copies of the SMN2 gene (± 20% stable SMN protein) very frequently produce SMA type I, three copies (± 30% stable SMN protein) mostly produce SMA type II, and four copies (± 40% stable SMN protein) of the SMN2 gene produce SMA type III and type IV (<LINK REF="REF-Melki-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melki 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cobben-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobben 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact cellular function of the SMN protein is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Sumner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumner 2007</LINK>). In motor neurons the mRNA splicing is probably dependent on the abundance of SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pellizzoni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellizzoni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gendron-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gendron 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablonka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablonka 2000</LINK>). SMN protein might be necessary for motor axon outgrowth (<LINK REF="REF-McWhorter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhorter 2003</LINK>), or SMN might have a protecting role in motor neurons against superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2007</LINK>). However, reduced amounts of functional SMN protein are found in all cell types of patients with SMA. The reason why abnormalities cause dysfunction of motor neurons and not other cell types remains to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>). Other hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of SMA include defective inhibition of apoptosis, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, defective axonogenesis and lack of neurotrophic factors in nerve or muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greensmith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greensmith 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crawford-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Russman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oprea-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oprea 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration of agents capable of increasing the expression of SMN protein levels may improve the outcome in SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Lorson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldkotter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldkotter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gavrilina-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gavrilina 2008</LINK>). Transcriptional SMN2 activation, facilitation of correct SMN2 splicing, translational activation and stabilisation of the full length SMN protein are considered as strategies for SMA therapy. Other strategies for therapy are improvement of motor neuron viability by neuroprotecting or neurotrophic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurmond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurmond 2008</LINK>). Recently, gene conversion from SMN2 gene to SMN1 gene in human cells from SMA patients has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-DiMatteo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiMatteo 2008</LINK>). In the future stem, cell therapy or gene therapy may compensate for the lack of sufficient SMN protein (<LINK REF="REF-Bertini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertini 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no known efficacious drug treatment for SMA type I or SMA types II and III (<LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicole 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iannaccone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannaccone 2003</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selecting trials for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>For this updated review, two authors (RW and AV) independently checked titles and abstracts obtained from the literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. From the full texts, the authors independently selected the trials that met the selection criteria for inclusion and graded their risk of bias. Authors were not blinded to the trial author and source institution. The authors resolved disagreement by reaching consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality assessment took into account allocation concealment, security of randomisation, intention-to-treat analysis, participant blinding (parent blinding), observer blinding, explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, explicit outcome criteria and how studies dealt with baseline differences between treatment groups. Each item was scored according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Risk of bias was graded as high, low or unclear. Two authors (RW and AV) graded the risk of bias independently. In the case of disagreement, the authors reassessed the studies and reached agreement by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to collect data from included trials</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (RW and AV) extracted data independently using a specially designed data extraction form. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. Disagreement did not occur, but would have been resolved by consensus with third party adjudication if necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>Only results of studies with the same class of drug treatment were to be pooled. For dichotomous data we would have calculated the relative risk for each study. To assess overall efficacy from all the studies, we would have calculated pooled relative risk estimates. If Chi<SUP>2</SUP> analysis had shown the data to be heterogeneous, we would have used a random-effects model with maximum likelihood estimation. If no heterogeneity was demonstrated, we would have used a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) method). For continuous data, we would have calculated mean differences between therapy and no therapy for each study. Mean differences (MD) were to be calculated if data were sufficiently comparable between studies; if not, we would have applied standard Review Manager (RevMan) generic inverse variance (GIV) analysis using treatment effect differences with their standard errors. Statistical uncertainty would have been expressed with 95% confidence intervals. Where studies had different follow-up periods appropriate adjustments would have been used, possibly with the RevMan GIV facility or, if necessary, Poisson regression allowing for the aggregate person time at risk in the study groups. For survival or time to full time ventilation we would have expected to obtain results from Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.<BR/>A sensitivity analysis would have been performed on the basis of the methodological quality of the studies. Statistical considerations would have involved a trade-off between bias and precision. Risk of bias will be assessed as 'unclear' when too few details are available to make a judgement of &#8216;high&#8217; or &#8216;low&#8217; risk; when the risk of bias is genuinely unknown despite sufficient information about the conduct; or when an entry is not relevant to a study. All studies will be described by a precise risk of bias. Formal comparisons of intervention effects according to risk of bias would be done using meta- regression. The major approach to incorporating risk of bias assessments would be to incorporate and restrict meta-analyses to studies at low (or lower) risk of bias.</P>

<P>For this updated review the number of studies found by the new, current search strategies were: MEDLINE 317 (85 new), EMBASE 89 (22 new), Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Specialized Register 30 (6 new), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 52 (11 new) and ISI Web of Knowledge 418 (23 new). We identified and assessed five studies (one new) for possible inclusion in the review. Four studies were excluded because they were not randomised or controlled, or clinical outcome measures were not assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brichta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brichta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2009</LINK>). See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>One study remained that fulfilled the selection criteria. This study was a randomised placebo-controlled study of riluzole in children with SMA type I (<LINK REF="STD-Russman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Russman 2003</LINK>). Details of the study are shown in &#8216;<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>&#8217;. The main outcome measure of the study was the occurrence of adverse events, the secondary outcome was mortality under the assumption that the life expectancy would be no more than 24 months. All children fulfilled clinical criteria for SMA type I, namely onset before the age of six months, never achieving the ability to sit independently and genetic confirmation of the diagnosis of SMA. The study investigators planned to include 30 children with randomisation in a 2:1 ratio (riluzole: placebo). Unfortunately, support from the pharmaceutical industry was withdrawn when Rhone-Poulenc was taken over by Aventis. From then on no more children were enrolled in the study and therefore the total number of included children was only 10.</P>

For several reasons the overall quality of the study was low. Only one-third of the intended enrolment was reached and there were baseline differences between the treatment groups that may have influenced the results: in the placebo group, the age at onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis and age at enrolment in the study were younger than in the riluzole group. The randomisation method and blinding of parents and observers were not clear. Allocation concealment and diagnostic criteria for SMA type I were adequate. The primary outcome was clear and follow-up of the 10 included children was complete.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 09:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>In SMA type I there was only one randomised controlled study (RCT) on drug treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Russman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Russman 2003</LINK>). This study compared treatment with riluzole versus placebo (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Riluzole is thought to have a neuroprotective effect on the motor neuron by blocking the presynaptic release of glutamate. Glutamate is released after presynaptic depolarisation and if the amino acid is not efficiently cleared it leads to increased levels of free radicals and eventually degeneration of motor neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merlini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merlini 2003</LINK>). Riluzole has been proven to be modestly effective in slowing disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motor neuron disease) (<LINK REF="REF-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riviere-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riviere 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Traynor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traynor 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2007</LINK>) with only minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Wokke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wokke 1996</LINK>). In a mouse model of SMA riluzole attenuated the disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Russman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Russman 2003</LINK>), three children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48 and 64 months, whereas in the placebo group all children died. It is not possible to conclude from this trial that riluzole is an efficacious treatment in SMA type I because the study did not have enough power due to the fact that support from the pharmaceutical industry was withdrawn and only 10 children were randomised in a 2:1 ratio. Also, the children in the placebo group were younger at the onset of symptoms, at diagnosis and at enrolment in the study compared to the children treated with riluzole. These baseline differences could imply that the placebo group was a subgroup of SMA type I with a worse disease course than the other children with SMA type I. However, it is intriguing that three out of seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at ages two, three and five years and used BiPAP ventilation support only at night. According to the clinical criteria for SMA type I they should have died before the age of two years. Children with a diagnosis of SMA type I who survive longer than two years may be considered to have SMA type II, but the children in this study did not achieve the ability to sit and therefore did not fulfil the clinical criteria for SMA type II.</P>
<P>Although the study had insufficient power and the treatment groups were not comparable at baseline, riluzole treatment in SMA type I appears to be safe and well tolerated. A larger trial with riluzole is needed to evaluate to what extent treatment with this drug could be efficacious.</P>
<P>Other drugs that have been tested in open and uncontrolled studies of children with SMA type I are valproate, hydroxyurea and recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brichta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brichta 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swoboda-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Swoboda 2009</LINK>). However, one trial with valproate studied human SMN expression in blood, not the disease course (<LINK REF="STD-Brichta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brichta 2006</LINK>). A multicentre phase I/II trial on treatment with valproate and carnitine of infants with SMA type I is ongoing, but this is an open uncontrolled study (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00661453" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00661453</LINK>). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disease of the motor neurons, there was no effect on disease course in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of valproate in 163 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Piepers-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepers 2008a</LINK>). The study with hydroxyurea in two participants with SMA type I, five participants with SMA type II and two participants with SMA type III demonstrated an improvement in muscle power and clinical improvement without side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>). A phase I/II trial using hydroxyurea in children with SMA type I has been completed, but the results have not yet been published (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00568698" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00568698</LINK>). An RCT on hydroxyurea in participants with SMA types II and III did not show any effect (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>). There are no trials on the effect of treatment with hydroxyurea in other neuromuscular diseases. A nonrandomised uncontrolled study on the safety and tolerability of recombinant ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) included 10 children with SMA type I (<LINK REF="STD-Franz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 1995</LINK>). Six children died; no change in muscle function and strength was noted and no differences could be made between disease course and side effects. Two randomised placebo-controlled trials of CNTF in 570 and 730 patients with ALS, and a meta-analysis, were negative (<LINK REF="REF-ACTS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACTS 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bongioanni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bongioanni 2004</LINK>). A multicenter, open label phase I/II trial on treatment with multiple dosage levels of phenylbutyrate to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest dose that can be safely given to children with SMA type I has been terminated due to extremely slow enrolment (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00439218" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00439218</LINK>). A similar trial with increasing dose of sodium butyrate in children with SMA types II and III also has been terminated because of poor compliance with the study drug administration (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00439569" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00439569</LINK>). There is an ongoing phase I/II study with phenylbutyrate in presymptomatic infants genetically confirmed to have SMA and to have probable SMA type I or type II (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00528268" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00528268</LINK>). </P>
<P>From these studies it is not possible to conclude whether treatment with the drugs used could have a beneficial clinical effect on the disease course of SMA type I. Other drugs that seem promising in open and uncontrolled trials in children and adults with SMA types II and III are described in the separate Cochrane review on drug treatment for spinal muscular atrophy type II and III (<LINK REF="REF-Wadman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadman 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is ethically debatable whether it is desirable to treat children with SMA type I with a drug that has an effect on survival but not on achieving motor milestones such as rolling, sitting, standing or walking. Recently, arguments for and against were described (<LINK REF="REF-Bach-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2008</LINK>). In our opinion children with SMA type I should not be treated with a drug that may prolong survival but does not appear to improve motor function. Therefore, we would not recommend treatment of children with SMA type I with riluzole.</P>
<P>There is a broad range of practice regarding pulmonary, nutritional, orthopaedic, and other forms of supportive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2007</LINK>) in children with SMA type I. Practice guidelines for the clinical care of children and adults with SMA are given in the consensus statement for standard care in SMA (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2007</LINK>). Due to intensive supportive care, such as ventilation, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation and gastronomy tube feeding, the survival of children with SMA type I has significantly increased in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Oskoui-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oskoui 2007</LINK>). For future trials it is very important that the supportive care in the different treatment arms is the same. If some children are treated with pro-active care and others with palliative care, stratifying these two groups in each treatment arm (drug or placebo) should be considered.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-29 09:05:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Renske I Wadman">
<P>Possible drug treatments for SMA type I should be sought and large randomised placebo-controlled studies are needed to show the efficacy of drug treatment. A larger trial with riluzole is needed to evaluate to what extent this drug could be efficacious. Future trials should report possible side effects, especially serious adverse events. The time from the beginning of treatment until death or full time ventilation should be the primary outcome measure. The (intensive) supportive care in each treatment arm should be the same. The change in motor function, daily functioning and quality of life should also be considered as outcome measures. Developing a new functional rating scale or choosing an existing functional rating scale as a standard scale for all trials is recommended. Study investigators in multicenter trials should be well trained to reliably and consistently measure muscle strength by quantitative myometry and pulmonary function to avoid large variation in the measurements between and within the participating centres.</P>
