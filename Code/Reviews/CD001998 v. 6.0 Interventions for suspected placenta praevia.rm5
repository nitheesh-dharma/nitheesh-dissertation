<P>There is little evidence about the best care for placenta praevia, although putting a stitch in the cervix during pregnancy may reduce associated preterm birth.</P>
<P>Placenta praevia is when the placenta (afterbirth) lies across the bottom of the womb. This means that it is lying either totally across the cervix (opening of the womb) or partially so. Placenta praevia can cause life-threatening blood loss. There are different ways of diagnosing placenta praevia, and various options for care around birth. However, there are only trials of cervical cerclage ('tying' the cervix), and the effects of hospitalisation. The review found that cervical cerclage may reduce very premature births, although the evidence was not strong. There is little evidence of advantages or disadvantages to hospitalisation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:12:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>A comprehensive electronic search was performed to identify relevant literature. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (August 2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 1 October 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Any controlled clinical trial that has assessed the impact of an intervention in women diagnosed as having, or being likely to have, placenta praevia. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted, unblinded, by the author without consideration of results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials were included, involving a total of 114 women. Both tested interventions (home versus hospitalisation and cervical cerclage versus no cerclage) were associated with reduced lengths of stay in hospital antenatally: weighted mean difference (WMD) respectively -18.50 days (95% confidence interval (CI) -26.83 to -10.17), -4.80 days (95% CI -6.37 to -3.23). Otherwise, there was little evidence of any clear advantage or disadvantage to a policy of home versus hospital care. The one woman who had a haemorrhage severe enough to require immediate transfusion and delivery was in the home care group. Cervical cerclage may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks: relative risk (RR) 0.45 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.87), or the birth of a baby weighing less than two kilograms RR 0.34 (0.14 to 0.83) or having a low five minute Apgar score RR 0.19 (0.04 to 1.00). In general, these possible benefits were more evident in the trial of lower methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:13:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>There are insufficient data from trials to recommend any change in clinical practice. Available data should, however, encourage further work to address the safety of more conservative policies of hospitalisation for women with suspected placenta praevia, and the possible value of insertion of a cervical suture.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 11:35:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-09 11:35:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The major, although not the most common, causes of antepartum haemorrhage are placenta praevia and placental abruption (premature separation). Placenta praevia is a placenta that is implanted entirely or partly in the lower uterine segment. Haemorrhage is especially likely to occur during third trimester with development of the lower uterine segment, and when uterine contractions dilate the cervix, thereby applying shearing forces to the placental attachment to the lower segment, or when separation is provoked by vaginal examination. Placenta praevia may be sub-classified as 'major' (implanted across the cervix) or 'minor' (not implanted across the cervix). Placentas that appear to be praevia but of minor degree may 'rise', as the lower segment develops, to become normally sited.</P>
<P>Maternal deaths from haemorrhage are now uncommon in the industrialised world. The latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK reports three maternal deaths associated with placenta praevia between 1997 and 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>). However, when Macafee (<LINK REF="REF-Macafee-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macafee 1945</LINK>) began his pioneering work in Belfast on the management of placenta praevia, the maternal mortality associated with this condition was as high as 5%. In developing countries today, widespread pre-existing anaemia, difficulties with transport, and restricted medical facilities ensure that placenta praevia continues to be responsible for many maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Fetal loss is less commonly associated with placenta praevia than with placental abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1994</LINK>) but both conditions can be associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity. Up to a fifth of very preterm babies are born in association with antepartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Hagan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagan 1996</LINK>), and the known significant association of antepartum haemorrhage with cerebral palsy can be explained by the common link of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The basic principles of immediate care of women with either type of antepartum haemorrhage include: assessment of maternal and fetal condition; prompt maternal resuscitation if this is required; and consideration of early delivery if there is evidence of fetal distress and if the baby is of sufficient maturity to be potentially capable of survival. Anti D immunoglobulin should be given to all unsensitised Rhesus negative women (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>); varying doses are given (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two classical presentations of placenta praevia are as antepartum haemorrhage or as fetal malpresentation in late pregnancy. To these must now be added another important presentation - the diagnosis of asymptomatic placenta praevia by routine ultrasound examination. Diagnosis of placenta praevia was an early achievement in the pioneering studies of ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 1967</LINK>). For conventional transabdominal ultrasound examination, it is customary to ask the woman to fill her bladder to optimize imaging of her cervix and lower uterine segment. It is easier to delineate the site of anterior placentas than those with posterior attachments for two reasons. First, acoustic shadowing from the fetal presenting part may obscure portions of a posterior placenta. Second, although the utero-vesical angle (the angle between the womb and the bladder) is used for reference anteriorly, a placenta with its lower edge below this being classified as praevia (or low), no such convenient anatomical marker for identifying the upper limit of the lower segment exists posteriorly. The ultrasonographer has to use an arbitrary point on the display screen. An alternative approach, in the light of these practical difficulties, is to measure the distance between the lower edge of the placenta and the internal cervical os. Some would regard a distance of five centimetres or more as excluding placental praevia. Here again, there are some difficulties. The appearances of the cervix may be affected by the amount of urine in the mother's bladder and identification of the precise position of the internal os may therefore be uncertain. Also, as is quite obvious to any obstetrician with experience of performing caesarean section at different stages of pregnancy, the extent of the lower segment is extremely variable rather than constant at five centimetres. </P>
<P>Another source of diagnostic and management difficulty is the now well-recognised phenomenon of the 'rising' placenta. Although around 5% of women have ultrasound evidence of a low placenta at 16 to 18 weeks, only 10% of this 5% (i.e. 0.5% overall) actually have a placenta praevia at delivery. The apparent change of placental position results from formation of the lower uterine segment. It has been suggested that transvaginal ultrasonography is more instructive than conventional transabdominal examination in cases of suspected placenta praevia (<LINK REF="REF-Tan--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1995</LINK>). There are a number of potential theoretical advantages to the use of transvaginal ultrasound in this situation because imaging is better and the woman does not need a full bladder, thus avoiding both maternal discomfort and also distortion of the anatomy of the lower uterine segment and cervix. On the other hand, insertion of an ultrasound probe into the vagina of a woman with possible placenta praevia could provoke bleeding. Advocates of transvaginal ultrasound argue that the probe should be inserted no more than three centimetres into the vagina and should not therefore come into contact with the cervix or lower segment, and that the improved images outweigh the theoretical disadvantages of provoking bleeding. </P>
<P>Other imaging techniques which have been used in the past to locate the placenta have fallen by the wayside. They include radio-isotope imaging and arteriography. Ultrasound has today only one technique which in any sense can be seen as a competitor - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The equipment required is extremely expensive and it seems at present unlikely, on economic grounds alone, that this technique will play a major role in practical placentography, although the quality of placental imaging that is possible is impressive (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1986</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Although ultrasound imaging has added to the practical diagnosis of placenta praevia, there remain situations in which the final diagnosis is confirmed, or excluded, by vaginal examination in the operating theatre. This may be required if the necessary ultrasound equipment or expertise is not available (including under-resourced settings), or if the woman is actively bleeding to a degree that delay in arranging or performing ultrasonography would be dangerous. In addition, there is a 'grey area' of ultrasonography in which it can be difficult to establish whether there is a minor degree of placenta praevia or a normally sited placenta. Also, ultrasonographers can make mistakes. Certain circumstances encourage these, such as the presence of an accessory lobe in the lower segment while the main bulk of the placenta can be clearly seen to be in the upper uterine segment. </P>
<P>Whether or not the woman is anaesthetised at the time of the examination in the operating theatre is usually a matter for individual clinical judgement depending on the perceived likelihood of actually encountering a placenta praevia. General anaesthesia allows a more thorough examination of the lower uterine segment but carries a small but real risk to the mother.<BR/> <BR/>The traditional policy of care of women with symptomatic placenta praevia required adherence to several principles: from the time of diagnosis, the woman was advised to remain in hospital; blood was to be constantly available for immediate transfusion; facilities were to be available for immediate caesarean section; anaemia was to be identified and corrected, if necessary by repeated blood transfusion, because of the likelihood of further haemorrhage; delivery (by caesarean section) was planned for 38 weeks unless indicated by further haemorrhage before that time.</P>
<P>Facets of this regimen deserve scrutiny, either because the value of specific interventions has been questioned or because innovations have been suggested.</P>
<P>The well established principle of a need for universal hospitalisation of women with symptomatic placenta praevia has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Love-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Love 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>With current anxieties about the risk of viral infection after blood transfusion, the use of autologous blood donation (i.e. by the woman herself) can be considered when the safety of donor blood supply is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Dinsmoor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinsmoor 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because it is thought that bleeding occurs mainly as a result of placental detachment from a lengthening lower uterine segment and dilating cervix, cervical cerclage has been advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Arias-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias 1988</LINK>) although insertion of a suture could presumably provoke bleeding even if this intervention were shown to confer other benefits. Similarly, tocolytic drugs, such as ritodrine, could theoretically lessen the likelihood of bleeding by inhibiting uterine contractions and their effect on the lower segment (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1995</LINK>). However, their actions on maternal cardiovascular function may be positively unhelpful - the frequently associated tachycardia can make it difficult to assess maternal condition after further bleeding, and the maternal cardiovascular response to acute hypovolaemia may be impaired.</P>
<P>The standard recommendation used to be that once the pregnancy had advanced to 38 weeks, or if the first haemorrhage occurred at that time, delivery should be effected. With enhanced gestational dating as a result of routine early ultrasonography (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2002</LINK>), there might be merit in earlier planned delivery to diminish the risk of major haemorrhage. On the other hand, a greater gestational age may minimise the risk of failure to observe a 'rising placenta', and may be better for the baby.</P>
<P>If anything, greater dilemmas exist as to what advice to offer about hospitalisation to women found to have an apparent placenta praevia (on ultrasound examination) but who have not bled. Both the need for hospitalisation and the timing and duration of hospitalisation (if advised) deserve study given the domestic disruption and economic consequences of this policy.</P>
<P>Once a decision to perform caesarean section has been made, questions arise about anaesthesia and surgical technique. It used to be said that epidural and spinal anaesthesia were contraindicated, and that general anaesthesia was mandatory at caesarean section for placenta praevia. Certainly, haemorrhage is encountered more commonly than at caesarean section for other indications and the sympathetic block induced by these forms of regional anaesthesia could inhibit the maternal response to acute blood loss. This theoretical disadvantage has to be weighed against the benefits of regional anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Bonner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonner 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Caesarean section for placenta praevia can be difficult and at times extremely difficult. The most commonly encountered difficulty is haemorrhage; the worst scenario may be the discovery of placenta praevia accreta, with invasion of the placenta into the myometrium and consequent difficulties in removing the placenta. Caesarean section is usually performed through a transverse skin incision and through the lower segment of the uterus but if there is an anterior placenta praevia, the vessels may be fearsome and the placenta will be met underneath the uterine incision. The baby may be delivered by the obstetrician passing a hand round the margins of the placenta, or by incising the placenta. Careful ultrasound mapping of the placental site prior to operation may help the surgeon to know in which direction the nearest edge of a placenta-overlying uterine incision, will be located. It may be easier for the obstetrician to bring down one of the baby's feet and perform breech extraction than to try to deliver a very high head past the placenta which occupies the uterine wound. Some recommend immediate cord clamping to prevent fetal exsanguitation if the placenta is cut.</P>

<P>The details of the three eligible trials are described in the Table of Included Studies. (Five reports from an updated search in October 2009 have been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.)</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-St-Louis-1988" TYPE="STUDY">St Louis 1988</LINK> study used the women's year of birth to allocate participants, thus running the risk of selection bias. Analysis was not by 'intention to treat' and one woman who declined cervical cerclage was included, for analyses, in the control group. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Los-Angeles-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Los Angeles 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cali-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cali 1998</LINK> trials employed robust methods of allocation concealment, and 'intention to treat' analyses.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Three trials were included, involving a total of 114 women - two of cervical cerclage; the other of home versus hospital care. Both interventions (home versus hospitalisation and cervical cerclage versus no cerclage) were associated with reduced lengths of stay in hospital antenatally: weighted mean difference (WMD) respectively -18.50 days (95% CI -26.83 to -10.17), -4.80 days (95% CI -6.37 to -3.23). Otherwise, there was little evidence of any clear advantage or disadvantage to a policy of home versus hospital care. The one woman who had a haemorrhage severe enough to require immediate transfusion and delivery was in the home care group.</P>
<P>Cervical cerclage may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks with a relative risk (RR) 0.45 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.87), or the birth of a baby weighing less than two kilograms RR 0.34 (0.14 to 0.83) or having a low five-minute Apgar score RR 0.19 (0.04 to 1.00). In general, these possible benefits were more evident in the trial of lower methodological quality.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Life threatening haemorrhage from placenta praevia is uncommon in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>) but the manifestly serious nature of this complication means that large trials would be required to demonstrate that novel policies or treatments are safe.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:14:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are only three trials included in this review, generating insufficiently extensive data to recommend any change in practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:14:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>It is surprising that so few trials have addressed aspects of care of this important obstetric complication. The scarce data that are available from clinical trials should encourage further work. In particular, the safety (or risks) of less interventionist policies of hospitalisation for women with suspected placenta praevia deserves attention. The question of whether insertion of a cervical suture helps prolong pregnancies complicated by placenta praevia also deserves further investigation. Such studies should be sufficiently well powered to address substantive indices of fetal outcome.</P>

<P>Randomisation by opening consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Women with ultrasound diagnosis of placenta praevia (major or minor) after antepartum haemorrhage. Inclusion criteria: singleton pregnancy; gestation 24 to 36 weeks; intact membranes; normal fetal anatomy; reactive cardiotocography. Exclusion criteria: haemodynamic instability; other cause of bleeding; 3 or more episodes of bleeding; other obstetric complications; serious maternal medical disorders; lack of telephone at home; lack of immediate transport from home.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>It was planned that women in the outpatient care allocation group [N = 26] would be discharged home after around 72 hours; that they would have weekly ultrasound scans; that they would be re-admitted to hospital (and subsequently discharged) if they had a second bleed; that they would remain hospitalized if they had a third bleed. Seven women allocated to outpatient care were not discharged: 4 had complications that precluded discharge; 2 refused to go home; 1 had domestic circumstances that pre-empted home care. Analysis was by 'intention to treat'. Women allocated to inpatient care [N = 27] were advised to remain in bed except for use of bathroom. Seven of these women discharged themselves against medical advice. Women in both groups received weekly corticosteroids until 32 weeks and underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal lung maturation at 36 weeks with caesarean section thereafter unless the placenta had risen.</P>

<P>The experimental group [13] underwent cervical cerclage (McDonald procedure using 5mm Mersilene band) once the bleeding had settled with prophylactic tocolytic cover (indomethacin rectal suppository followed by oral dose for 48 hours), and planned discharge home 48 hours after cerclage, on oral terbutaline. Women in the control group [12] remained in hospital until delivery; they were treated with oral terbutaline to try to prevent uterine contractions, and were given a course of corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation once they reached 28 weeks.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Gestational age and infant weight at delivery; need for blood transfusion; caesarean hysterectomy rates; financial costs.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Although the intervention of greatest interest in this study is cervical cerclage, this was part of a package of care that differed from that offered to women in the control group in other respects (notably in outpatient versus inpatient care).</P>
