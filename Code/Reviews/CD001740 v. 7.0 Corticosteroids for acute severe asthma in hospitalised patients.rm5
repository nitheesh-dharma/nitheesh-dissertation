<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation), which can cause breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Attacks can be fatal. Drugs (by inhaler, taken by mouth, or through the veins) can be used to relieve the muscles. Steroids (corticosteroids) are anti-inflammatory drugs that can reduce the swelling. The review found that lower doses of corticosteroids work as well as higher doses to start with, when a person is hospitalised with an asthma attack.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated.

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (&lt; or = 80 mg), medium dose (&gt; 80 mg and &lt; or = 360 mg) and high dose (&gt; 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 10:39:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted in September 2002. No new trials were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (&lt; or = 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or &lt; or = 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 10:48:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Haskell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Haskell 1983</LINK>), while others have not (<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1992</LINK>). In general, studies which have examined the use and dosage of corticosteroids and other treatments in acute severe asthma have been small. This has often resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect a potentially clinically important difference between treatments (type II error) (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1986</LINK>). <BR/> <BR/>While the benefit of corticosteroids is now widely accepted, there are a number of short term side effects that may occur in a dose dependent fashion. Studies which have examined acute psychiatric reactions have demonstrated a significant dose response relationship (<LINK REF="REF-BCDSP-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCDSP 1972</LINK>). A similar relationship exists for steroid induced myopathy, usually with long term use (<LINK REF="REF-Bowyer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowyer 1985</LINK>). However acute myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have also been associated with short term high dose corticosteroids. Fluid and electrolyte disturbance, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease and manifestation of latent diabetes may also be dependent on corticosteroid dosage. Moreover, differences in doses may be important from the perspective of treatment benefit and costs. Thus, determining the appropriate doses and route of delivery is an important issue in acute asthma care.</P>
<P>The mechanism of action of corticosteroids in asthma has been investigated most extensively in chronic and subacute asthma where inhaled corticosteroids have become the mainstay of modern asthma therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995a</LINK>). Corticosteroids have been shown to improve asthma symptoms by reducing airway inflammation, airway reactivity and airway secretions and restoring the integrity of the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>). In contrast, research on the use and mechanisms of action of corticosteroids during an acute exacerbation of asthma has been limited. Objective improvements in airflow obstruction have usually not been demonstrated during the first 6 to 12 hours of treatment with corticosteroids in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1990</LINK>). The delayed onset of action is likely related to the way in which corticosteroids activate glucocorticoid receptors to directly or indirectly regulate transcription of certain target genes (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1998</LINK>). Other aspects of steroid pharmacology might be important in the early phase of treatment including effects on the microvasculature with inhibition of plasma exudation and oedema formation in the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Persson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persson 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1992</LINK>) and the reversal of beta-2 receptor subsensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Svedmyr-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svedmyr 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>Narrative reviews have previously examined the issue of corticosteroid dose in the management of acute asthma and have made broad recommendations, but have highlighted that clear dose response relationships have not been established (<LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Engel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1991</LINK>). A systematic review has also been conducted, this included both inpatient and outpatient studies and noted a trend toward improved outcome with high and moderate doses of corticosteroids which was not statistically significant, concluding that further research was needed to define the role of high dose regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>). Given the delayed onset of action of systemic corticosteroids in acute asthma and the different patterns of response to therapy in general in the emergency management of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1997</LINK>), dose response characteristics may best be examined in the group of patients requiring hospitalisation and ongoing treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.</P>
<P>Specifically this review examined three main comparisons:<BR/>(1) Low versus medium dose corticosteroids;<BR/>(2) Medium versus high dose corticosteroids;<BR/>(3) Low versus high dose corticosteroids.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies that were described as randomised controlled trials (RCT) were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults (age 16 to 65) with acute severe asthma defined by history, doctor's diagnosis, response to initial treatment, spirometry or peak flow were considered. Only studies where patients were treated in an emergency or outpatient department and required hospital admission (but not mechanical ventilation) were included. Studies that included patients on pre-existing oral or inhaled corticosteroids were included and sub-group comparisons based on prior corticosteroid use were planned.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 10:48:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies reporting results of patients randomised to receive oral, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids (including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone, betamethasone or triamcinolone) at different doses were included.</P>
<P>To standardise the comparisons, all corticosteroid doses were converted to methylprednisolone equivalents based on known potencies (Zimet, 1986). Comparisons were made between the following groups defined in methylprednisolone (MP) equivalent doses (total daily dose). Hydrocortisone (HC) equivalent doses and prednisolone (P) equivalent doses are also provided (total daily dose) respectively below: </P>
<P>Low dose: less than or equal to 80 mg(MP) or 400 mg(HC) or 100 mg (P). </P>
<P>Medium dose: more than 80 mg(MP) or 400 mg(HC) or 100 mg (P) and less than or equal to 360 mg(MP) or 1800 mg(HC) or 450 mg (P). </P>
<P>High dose: more than 360 mg(MP) or 1800 mg(HC) or 450 mg (P). </P>
<P>These cut-points were chosen following review of the literature and reflect what previous researchers and authors had classified as low, medium or high dose. The reviewers also felt that these definitions were clinically appropriate. Nonetheless the terms low, medium and high are applied as descriptive labels only and do not represent a value judgement about the specific quantitative levels. </P>
<P>There were 3 main comparison categories, as follows: Low versus medium dose (L vs M); medium versus high dose (M vs H) and low versus high dose (L vs H). </P>
<P>Data on co-interventions was collected including information regarding additional therapy such as beta-agonists, anticholinergics, theophylline compounds, antibiotics, oxygen, etc.</P>

<P>Current Contents (mid 1997 to November 1998) was also searched using the key words asthma and acute OR status OR exacerbation and corticosteroids (including the above list of alternative terms for corticosteroids). Authors of identified studies were contacted to determine whether they were aware of any related unpublished or published studies or work in progress. The bibliographies of identified studies and narrative reviews were searched for additional citations. Scientific advisors of the various pharmaceutical companies that manufacture corticosteroids were contacted for any unpublished or interim results on corticosteroid dosing research. An advanced search of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) was conducted using the above search strategy.

<BR/>All studies included adult patients with acute severe asthma who were admitted to hospital for ongoing management. None of the studies included patients who required ventilation or intensive care on admission.

Another of the studies did not specify the dose of regular oral corticosteroid used by the relevant participants but included relatively large numbers of subjects receiving such treatment [<LINK REF="STD-Morell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morell 1992</LINK>]. Regular corticosteroid use was not mentioned in one of the studies [<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1987</LINK>].

<P>INTERVENTIONS:<BR/>Four of the studies were designed specifically to compare different doses of corticosteroids (same type &amp; route) [<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haskell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Haskell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marquette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marquette 1995</LINK>].

<P>OUTCOMES:<BR/>Most studies reported data on PEFR or FEV1 and these data form the basis for the quantitative analysis in the review. FVC could not be included as an outcome due to limited reporting of this variable in the primary studies. Three studies did not provide sufficient data to be included in the quantitative analysis and the primary authors have not been able to provide further details as yet [<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1987</LINK>]. The results for pulmonary function data are presented as a percentage of predicted and where specified in the primary studies the post bronchodilator values have been used. For several studies some data were extrapolated from graphs. Authors have been asked to confirm data extraction however none have provided this information as yet. Contact has been established with all but 1 author [<LINK REF="STD-Haskell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Haskell 1983</LINK>]. For the main results data was extracted by 2 reviewers (RM &amp; DR) and the values did not differ by more than 1% predicted FEV1 or PEFR for means or standard errors for any of the values. One of the studies measured pulmonary function at 44 hours rather than 48 hours and this data has been included for the time period 48 hours [<LINK REF="STD-Marquette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marquette 1995</LINK>].</P>
<P>DESIGN:<BR/>Most of the studies provided some information on losses to follow up but none of them provided an intention to treat analysis. All were randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>The pooled WMDs for PEFR at 48 hours and 72 hours for the comparison between medium and high doses were - 2.9 (-16.2 to + 10.3), 2.7 % predicted (-16.3 to + 21.7), respectively.

<P>It should be noted that for one of the studies [<LINK REF="STD-Ratto-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ratto 1988</LINK>] the standard deviations for PEFR and FEV1 data at 72 hours were very wide.

Another study reported that there were no significant differences in the changes in PaO2 and PaCO2 at 6 or 48 hours between the high and low dose groups, but did not provide sufficient data for this to be included in the analysis [<LINK REF="STD-Morell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morell 1992</LINK>].</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SIDE EFFECTS</HEADING>
<P>There was no consistent reporting of side effects and quantitative analysis could not be performed. Four studies made no specific comment on side effects [<LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haskell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Haskell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1992</LINK>]. Three studies stated that there were no serious side effects reported [<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratto-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ratto 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Engel 1990</LINK>]. One study reported that one of the patients in the lower dose group (840 mg methylprednisolone in 24 hours) developed a bleeding duodenal ulcer and another patient in the same group developed a transient sinus tachycardia [<LINK REF="STD-Morell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morell 1992</LINK>]. Another study reported that one patient in the low dose group, with a history of psychiatric illness, developed an acute delirium, however neuroleptic medication had been inadvertently stopped on admission [<LINK REF="STD-Marquette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marquette 1995</LINK>]. Despite limited data, in general, the use of varying doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma appear to be well tolerated.</P>

<P>One study reported that a patient in the high dose group, with known glucose intolerance developed severe hyperglycemia requiring prolonged insulin treatment [<LINK REF="STD-Marquette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marquette 1995</LINK>]. Five studies reported that there were no significant differences found between high and low dose groups in terms of blood glucose levels, however there was insufficient data provided for a quantitative analysis [<LINK REF="STD-Haskell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Haskell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratto-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ratto 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Engel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marquette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marquette 1995</LINK>].</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">HETEROGENEITY</HEADING>
<P>Using a cut off level of significance of P&lt;0.05 no statistical heterogeneity was detected for any of the outcomes. This test is considered weak when the number of studies and total information in the review is small (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>). Nonetheless, visual inspection of the analyses shows considerable overlap of 95% CIs and all CIs of individual studies cross the pooled WMD line.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SUBGROUP ANALYSES</HEADING>
<P>A further analysis was conducted on the studies that used very low doses of corticosteroids (200 mg hydrocortisone or 40 mg methylprednisolone equivalent) compared with high dose. Data for this analysis was limited to 24 hours (FEV1) and included 2 studies only. The pooled WMD was + 7.2 % predicted (-2.3 to 16.7) in favour of very low dose using the fixed effects model. A subgroup analysis could not be performed on those subjects who were receiving prior oral or inhaled corticosteroids due to insufficient data (refer to included studies section).<BR/>For the comparison oral vs intravenous (any dose) there were no statistically significant differences in FEV1 at 24 hours. The pooled WMD was 7.5 % predicted (-0.3 to + 15.2) in favour of oral therapy. There are only 2 studies in this comparison and one of these was rated as methodologically poor [<LINK REF="STD-Ratto-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ratto 1988</LINK>] and therefore this analysis should be interpreted with caution. The study by Harrison was not included because some patients in both groups received initial parenteral corticosteroids.</P>
<P>A sub group analysis was performed based on the severity of asthma however the proposed severity criteria could not be applied due to insufficient data. This analysis included 2 studies that only included subjects with an initial post bronchodilator FEV1 of 50% or less and a subgroup of patients from another study [<LINK REF="STD-Bowler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bowler 1992</LINK>] who had an initial post bronchodilator FEV1 of 30% or less. For the L vs H comparison at 48 hours the pooled WMD (FEV1) was +2.3 % predicted (-6.6 to + 11.2) in favour of low dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies applied appropriate diagnostic criteria for asthma and therefore it was not necessary to perform a sensitivity analysis based on this trial characteristic (Refer to table of included studies). A sensitivity analysis was performed based on methodological quality using both the Jadad scale (excluding studies that scored less than 4) and the Cochrane score for allocation concealment. This did not alter the results significantly in any of the main comparison categories. In addition using different methods for the meta-analysis did not alter the results significantly. For each of the 3 main comparison categories there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between high and low dose treatment groups using either fixed or random effects models.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>GENERALISABILITY<BR/>Patients<BR/>The studies included in the review did not include patients presenting with respiratory failure. Although some of the studies included some subjects on regular oral corticosteroids the total number was small and sub-group analysis was not possible. The findings may therefore, not be generalisable to patients on regular oral corticosteroids or those presenting in ventilatory failure. <BR/>In chronic asthma, some patients have been reported to require relatively high doses of oral maintenance corticosteroids and others are classified as steroid resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995b</LINK>). Consequently, these results may not apply to this small subset of patients. </P>
<P>Corticosteroid type<BR/>Methylprednisolone was the main corticosteroid used in the studies in the review. Some studies used hydrocortisone or prednisolone (See table of included studies). There have been few studies directly comparing the efficacy of different corticosteroids in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Sue-1986-_x0028_ii_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sue 1986 (ii)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1995</LINK>). While the relative anti-inflammatory potencies of different corticosteroids are well established, different potencies for lymphocyte suppression have been shown in in-vitro studies (<LINK REF="REF-Langhoff-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhoff 1983</LINK>). While this theoretical concern exists, applying these relative potencies to convert those studies using hydrocortisone or prednisolone to methylprednisolone did not significantly alter the results. </P>
<P>Setting<BR/>These results are applicable to the admitted severe asthmatic. Although the results may apply to asthmatics not requiring hospitalisation, dose responses should be assessed, where possible, by other reviews including patients treated on an outpatient basis.<BR/> <BR/>SIDE EFFECTS<BR/>There was insufficient data to determine trends in relation to dose and the risk of serious but rare side effects. Previous narrative reviews have suggested that total steroid dose may be a risk factor in peptic ulcer disease and acute myopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Pecora-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecora 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shee-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shee 1990</LINK>) however, very large numbers of participants would be required to detect differences in these outcomes. </P>
<P>STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE<BR/>The results are consistent across each of the comparison groups and indicate that methylprednisolone doses above 60 to 80 mg per day provide no added benefit for lung function response in acute asthma. Furthermore, for each of the comparison categories the 95% CIs at 24 and 48 hours encompass values of limited clinical significance. For example using the fixed effects model for the L vs H comparison at 48 hours the maximum potential mean improvement in % predicted FEV1 was 8% in favour of the high dose group or 9% in favour of the low dose group. In most of the original studies a clinically significant difference was defined as a difference of 0.5 litre or 20% predicted FEV1. <BR/> <BR/>METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS<BR/>Design of studies:<BR/>The majority of included studies were constructed to assess whether different doses of corticosteroids were equivalent in acute asthma. However, the lack of difference does not guarantee equivalence and the finding of equivalence does not infer that both treatments are effective. Small studies failing to find significance between treatments are under-powered to detect differences and severely underpowered to demonstrate equivalence. This systematic review pools similar studies to address this issue. While the issue of efficacy is not addressed, corticosteroids clearly have an important role in the management of asthma. For example, a recent Cochrane review has shown that corticosteroids reduce the risk of relapse in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Missing data: <BR/>The exclusion of the three studies that did not provide sufficient data for the quantitative analysis is unlikely to alter the findings of the review given that none of them reported significant differences in outcome for varying corticosteroid doses [<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanaka-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tanaka 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morell 1992</LINK>].<BR/> <BR/>Size of review <BR/>The number of studies included in the meta-analysis for each comparison is small. Guidelines on how much information a meta-analysis should include to be reliable are currently lacking. (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>) Some authors have suggested that the role of the small meta-analysis may predominantly be to summarise available information and generate hypotheses for further research. (<LINK REF="REF-Flather-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flather 1997</LINK>) </P>
<P>Publication bias <BR/>Given that most of the published studies reported no difference between varying doses of corticosteroids publication bias did not appear to be an important factor in this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. Varying doses of corticosteroids used in the treatment of admitted patients with acute asthma appear to result in similar outcomes when pulmonary function data are examined. <BR/>2. Doses of 60 to 80 mg per day of methylprednisolone or 300 mg to 400 mg per day of hydrocortisone appear to be sufficient in the initial management of adults with acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Higher doses do not appear to offer an obvious therapeutic advantage. <BR/>3. The results appear to be relevant for asthmatics with severe attacks however the applicability to patients requiring ventilatory support could not be assessed due to the exclusion of such patients from the studies in the review.<BR/>4. Due to the small number of patients on regular oral corticosteroids in the included studies, clear inferences about the relevance of the findings to this sub-group of patients could not be made.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Studies involving children were not included in the review and a separate review is recommended. <BR/>2. Further studies that include patients requiring intensive care and or ventilatory support might be useful to clarify the risk-benefit of different doses of corticosteroids in this sub group. Given the increased risk of acute myopathy in these patients it would be important to determine whether higher doses contribute to this risk. Acute myopathy has not been reported in patients receiving daily doses of corticosteroids of the order used in the low dose groups in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Shee-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shee 1990</LINK>), however this may simply be a reflection of historical prescribing practices.<BR/>3. Only a small sub group analysis was possible based on very low doses (200 mg per day of hydrocortisone or 40 mg per day of methylprednisolone) but the results suggest that even these doses may be sufficient in the management of acute asthma. However, many clinicians may view the difference between 40 mg of methylprednisolone and 60 to 80 mg to be of limited clinical relevance and not worthy of further research. <BR/>4. Future research should consider collecting clinical outcomes such as duration of symptoms, relapse or need for additional treatment and symptom scores in a standardised fashion.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with an unequivocal history of asthma who had previously or subsequently showed short term variability in FEV1 of at least 15%. Subjects were eligible if they required hospital admission after treatment in the emergency room with 10mg of nebulised salbutamol and intravenous aminophylline. <BR/>Exclusions: Patients with pneumothorax or consolidation on chest x-ray, asthma that warranted admission to intensive care unit or other major illnesses. Subjects taking more than 10mg of prednisolone a day before admission.<BR/>Ages: 18-65 years.<BR/>PFTs: the mean baseline % predicted FEV1 &amp; PEFR after emergency department treatment for the whole group was 32.7% &amp; 48.8% respectively.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Group 1: 50mg intravenous hydrocortisone 6 hourly (equivalent methylprednisolone dose in 24 hours 40mg); Group 2: 200mg intravenous hydrocortisone 6 hourly (methylprednisolone equivalent dose 160mg); Group 3: 500mg intravenous hydrocortisone 6 hourly (methylprednisolone equivalent dose 400mg). <BR/>After 48 hours oral treatment with prednisolone was commenced with the following doses: group1; 20mg initially reducing to 5 mg over 12 days, group 2; 40mg initially reducing to 10mg over 12 days, group 3; 60mg initially reducing to 20mg over 12 days.<BR/>Cointerventions: 4 hourly nebulised salbutamol and IV aminophylline or oral theophylline. All subjects received metered dose inhaled beclomethasone 400mcg BD. </P>
<P/>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome was pulmonary function. FEV1 was measured daily for the first 48 hours. PEFR was measured daily (morning and evening) for 12 days. Severity of dyspnoea was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Treatment failures were recorded but not included in the final analysis.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Losses to follow up: 10 subjects were excluded after randomisation; 1 subject from the medium dose group required ICU; 2 patients in the low dose group and 3 in the medium dose group improved rapidly and requested discharge prior to the first 48 hours. There were 4 protocol violations due to either failure to collect data or the wrong steroid dose being administered; 1 in the high dose group and 3 in the low dose group.</P>

</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with status asthmaticus. Patients were considered to have asthma if they were known or suspected asthmatics without underlying emphysema or chronic bronchitis. All patients had to have demonstrable reversibility of airflow as measured by peak flows or spirometry at previous admissions, at admission for study, or at follow-up in the outpatient clinic. All patients were treated in the emergency department with inhaled beta agonist and intravenous aminophylline. Patients were then eligible for the study if the emergency department physician thought they should be admitted and the FEV1 was less than 50% predicted. <BR/>Exclusions: a history of smoking for greater than ten pack-years, or hospital steroid therapy more than 1 hour prior to the initial spirogram. <BR/>Ages: 18 to 65 years.<BR/>PFTs: mean FEV1 for whole group 26.5 % predicted (0.72 L), mean FVC 35% predicted (1.22L).</P>
