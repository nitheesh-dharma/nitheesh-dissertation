<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-01 12:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>Severe anaemia in cancer patients is linked with decreased tumour oxygen supply (hypoxia), which is associated with more rapid tumour progression, poor response to therapy and consequently has a negative impact on prognosis. Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which controls red blood cell production, is widely used to correct anaemia. It was therefore thought logical that using erythropoietin to correct anaemia, before or during chemotherapy, radiotherapy (or both), would improve tumour oxygenation and as a result improve prognosis.</P>
<P>The authors of this review found strong suggestions based on five randomised controlled trials (1397 patients) that for head and neck cancer, radiotherapy plus erythropoietin compared to radiotherapy alone negatively affects patient outcome in terms of overall survival and local-regional progression free survival.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:16:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Tumour hypoxia increases tumour invasiveness and has a negative impact on response to therapy. Hypoxic tumours are also associated with severely anaemic individuals. It has therefore been hypothesised that correcting anaemia, by increasing haemoglobin levels using erythropoietin, improves tumour oxygenation and consequently the patient's prognosis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-01 12:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>To assess whether combined treatment with radiotherapy and erythropoietin (RT plus EPO) is better than standard radiotherapy (RT alone) for the treatment of head and neck cancer patients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-05-07 15:43:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 24 February 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:16:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Two independent authors assessed identified studies according to the eligibility criteria: RCTs which delivered radiotherapy combined with or without erythropoietin, in patients of any age with head and neck cancer of any stage or type. In addition, trials administering concomitant iron therapy among one or both arms were also eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:17:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>For statistical analysis of survival data, we computed a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across studies. We used Chi<SUP>2</SUP> heterogeneity tests to test for statistical heterogeneity among trials and performed the statistical analyses using Review Manager 5.0.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:19:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Five RCTs with a total of 1397 patients were included. Pooled data yielded a significantly worse overall survival (OS) for RT plus EPO as compared to RT alone (Peto odds ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005, five trials). For local regional tumour control (LRTC) analyses resulted in a small but non-significant difference between the RT alone group and the RT plus EPO group (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03; P = 0.15, four trials). In addition, the local regional progression free survival (LRPFS) measured in four studies was significantly different between groups (Peto odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.80; P = 0.0002, four trials), in favour of the RT alone group. Two studies used supplemental iron in the RT plus EPO group and not in the RT alone group. When excluding these studies from the analyses, the statistically (non-) significant differences in OS, LRTC and LRPFS are maintained.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-08 09:14:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are strong suggestions that RT plus EPO has a negative influence on outcome as opposed to RT alone. However, the target haemoglobin concentration, which was higher than recommended in four of the five included RCTs, may have had a significant role. Nevertheless, based on these findings EPO should not be administered as an addition to RT outside the experimental setting for patients with head and neck cancer.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 09:25:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-13 09:04:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Tumour hypoxia (reduced oxygen) has been shown to affect the malignant progression of transformed cells and their response to therapy. Experimentally, hypoxia has been shown to promote tumour progression through the selection of tumour cells with diminished apoptotic potential, to stimulate pro-angiogenic gene expression, and to increase metastatic potential (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>). Several studies have shown a strong correlation between pretreatment tumour pO2 and tumour control and survival in patients with head and neck cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Brizel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brizel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordsmark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordsmark 1996</LINK>). Studies have also indicated that hypoxia increases tumour invasiveness and dissemination in human solid tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Fyles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fyles 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hockel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hockel 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been shown that individuals who are severely anaemic also have hypoxic tumours (though the reverse is not necessarily true), therefore it was though logical that increasing the haemoglobin concentration would improve the oxygenation of tumours and hence the patient's prognosis. Erythropoietin has been known for decades to be important for the development and the quality of red blood cells. Biotechnological advances have made erythropoietin available for the treatment or prevention of anaemia due to cancer or chemotherapy. For that indication, it is widely used worldwide. In addition to the possible beneficial effects of correcting anaemia for the patient's well-being, it has also been hypothesised that correcting anaemia may result in better oxygenation of the tumour and hence in less resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Several phase III trials have been performed in patients suffering from head and neck cancer, who were treated with radiotherapy with or without erythropoietin. The results of the first phase III trial reporting on this hypothesis were considered to be negative (<LINK REF="REF-Henke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henke 2003</LINK>). As a result several trials have been terminated, including the <LINK REF="REF-Machtay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machtay 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Overgaard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Overgaard 2007</LINK> studies. The reasons for the failure of erythropoietin to improve survival is unclear, but may include a haemoglobin level which was too high due to the drug, with an increase in cardio-vascular (thrombotic) events as a result or the stimulation of tumour cells mediated by erythropoietin receptors on cancer cells. The results of a recently published Cochrane Review indicate that research into the side effects of erythropoietin is inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the widespread use of erythropoietin in cancer patients, a systematic review and meta-analyses were performed, taking into account the results of published and non-published randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Since the type of concomitant chemotherapy (whether platinum based or not) may affect outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Harari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harari 2003</LINK>), we decided a priori to stratify for this factor (if this was possible using the available data). In addition, we planned subgroup analyses based on the following factors: radiation schedule, tumour type and stage, haemoglobin concentration at study entry, and use of iron supplementation.</P>

<P>The search method described above identified 256 studies. Of these studies, 230 were clearly irrelevant or duplicates and consequently excluded.

In the study performed by Lambin et al, the patients were only enrolled into the RT alone group and not into the erythropoietin group due to a randomisation fault.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2002</LINK>) were excluded as the intervention did not include radiotherapy.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 09:25:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This systematic review analysed overall survival, local regional progression free survival, local regional tumour control and treatment toxicity, with the intention of comparing the effectiveness of concomitant erythropoietin and (chemo) radiotherapy with (chemo) radiation therapy alone in the treatment of head and neck cancer.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes of this review suggest that the addition of erythropoietin negatively affects overall survival and local regional progression free survival. The analyses concerning local regional tumour control (with a certain amount of statistical heterogeneity), resulted in a non-significant difference. Further, based on the current evidence, no firm judgements can be made concerning the effects of erythropoietin on treatment toxicity.</P>
<P>As a result of the low number of included studies, it was not appropriate to perform sensitivity analyses or subgroup analyses as proposed in the published protocol. Factors such as platinum based chemotherapy or non-platinum based chemotherapy and haemoglobin concentration at study entry are reported to influence outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Harari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Henke 2003</LINK>), therefore such subgroup analyses may result in a greater insight into the effects of erythropoietin.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Henke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Henke 2003</LINK> study, which has substantial weight (27.5% to 30.2%) in the analyses concerning overall survival, local regional progression free survival and local regional tumour control, might be biased by the imbalance in baseline characteristics in favour of the RT alone group mentioned previously (more smokers and patients with relapsed cancer were enrolled in the erythropoietin group). In addition, the high percentage of protocol violations in this study may have induced bias. Recently, Henke et al published a sub-analysis of their data, in which a possible biological explanation for their 'unexpected' findings is pointed out (<LINK REF="REF-Henke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henke 2006</LINK>). They argue that erythropoietin receptors are variably expressed on head and neck cancer cells and that the negative effect of erythropoietin on the prognosis of head and neck cancer patients is restricted to patients who have cancer cells which express erythropoietin receptors. In these tumour cells, erythropoietin would stimulate tumour growth. This argument is supported by their data (<LINK REF="REF-Henke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henke 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another influencing factor on the effects of erythropoietin may be the target concentration of haemoglobin sustained in the included studies. The hypothesis pointed out by certain authors is that too high haemoglobin concentrations would increase blood viscosity and therefore increase the risk of thromboembolic events and/or decrease tissue oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2006</LINK>). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recommends initiating erythropoietin at a haemoglobin level of 9 to 11 g/dl based on anaemia-related symptoms, with a target concentration between 12 and 13 g/dl (<LINK REF="REF-EORTC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 2007</LINK>). According to this recommendation, patients enrolled in the RT alone group in the <LINK REF="STD-Henke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Henke 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoskin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskin 2004</LINK> studies had a favourable haemoglobin concentration compared with the RT plus EPO group (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Also the <LINK REF="STD-Overgaard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Overgaard 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Machtay-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Machtay 2007</LINK> studies had a higher target concentration than recommended by the EORTC; these were respectively 14.0 to 15.5 g/dl and 14.0 to 15.0 g/dl. The target concentration in the <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2003</LINK> study was substantially lower; that was to maintain a haemoglobin concentration of 10.0 g/dl. Consistent with the initial hypothesis, the <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2003</LINK> study, with a substantially lower haemoglobin concentration, is the only included study showing a (non-significant) risk ratio in favour of the RT plus EPO group (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review shows moderate evidence to indicate that erythropoietic proteins, as an adjuvant treatment with (chemo) radiotherapy, worsen survival for patients with head and neck cancer. Erythropoietin, with the intention to improve survival, should therefore not be administered outside the experimental setting for patients with head and neck cancer as an addition to (chemo) radiotherapy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-07 11:39:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Based on the results of this Cochrane Review, there is no evidence that the combined treatment of radiotherapy with erythropoietin yields an advantage compared to standard radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer patients. There is even a strong suggestion that erythropoietin negatively influences outcome. Publication of long-term follow up of unpublished studies, such as the DAHANCA trial (<LINK REF="STD-Overgaard-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Overgaard 2007</LINK>), and analysis of other endpoints such as acute and late toxicity, are essential to determine the role of (target) haemoglobin concentration and to draw firm conclusions.</P>

<P>A second discrepancy was the presentation of the outcomes for overall survival, local regional progression free survival and local regional tumour control. According to the protocol this should have been in terms of two-year and five-year ratios, however due to the marginal availability of data in this review, these two measures were combined into one ratio.</P>
<P>Thirdly, data to sustain analyses for secondary outcomes as proposed in the published protocol were lacking and therefore these were not performed.</P>
<P>Finally, for the <LINK REF="STD-Hoskin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskin 2004</LINK> study, only data for one-year follow up were available. According to the protocol this should have been at least two years to be included. However, owing to the scarcity of the included data, this study was included. In addition, trials administering concomitant iron therapy among one or both arms were also eligible.</P>
