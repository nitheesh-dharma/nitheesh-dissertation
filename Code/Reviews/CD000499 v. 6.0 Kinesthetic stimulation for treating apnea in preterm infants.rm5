<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the existing review of 'Kinesthetic stimulation for treating apnea in preterm infants' published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 1999. In the current update, we considered for inclusion several additional studies of kinesthetic stimulation in preterm infants, but found them not to be eligible. This was usually because apnea was not an outcome reported, or the study was not a randomized or quasi-randomized trial. Thus, there is no change to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to recommend kinesthetic stimulation as treatment for clinically important apnea of prematurity</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-28 15:00:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rocking therapy and physical stimulation have been advocated to assist preterm infants to breathe regularly and some have been designed to mimic <I>in utero</I> movements. A pause in breathing (apnea) is common in very preterm infants but it can lead to a lack of oxygen in the blood, so that the infant needs resuscitation and assisted ventilation. Pauses in breathing could also affect brain development and proper functioning of other organs. Physical stimulation is recognised as a means to wake up preterm infants who then start breathing on their own. Three controlled studies have used different gentle rocking motions (irregularly oscillating water beds, regularly rocking bed trays or a vertical pulsating stimulus) to reduce the occurrence of apnea in a total of 49 babies. However, there was no clinically useful reduction of periods of apnea, although only a small number of infants were studied. Shorter breathing pauses were reported to be reduced by one study but it is not thought to be clinically important. No harm has reported to be done to the preterm infants with these interventions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-28 14:55:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent apnea is common in preterm infants particularly at very early gestational ages. These episodes of loss of effective breathing can lead to hypoxemia and bradycardia, which may be severe enough to require resuscitation including use of positive pressure ventilation or other treatments. Physical stimulation is often used to restart breathing and it is possible that repeated kinesthetic stimulation might be used to treat infants with apnea and prevent its consequences.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-15 09:31:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apnea in infants has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds or an apneic event less than 20 seconds associated with bradycardia and/or cyanosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1978</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of apnea are common in preterm infants and the incidence and severity increases at lower gestational ages. Although apnea can occur spontaneously and be attributed to prematurity alone, it can also be provoked or made more severe if there is some additional insult such as infection, hypoxemia or intracranial pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-15 10:06:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various treatments for apnea in preterm infants have been used, including physical stimulation by nursing staff, pharmacological stimulation including methylxanthines (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005b</LINK>) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005b</LINK>). Kinesthetic stimulation using various forms of oscillating mattress has been used for prevention of apnea, and compared to use of methylxanthines which are the subject of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2005</LINK>). This review examines the effects of kinesthetic stimulation for treatment of apnea in preterm infants.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-15 09:33:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physical stimulation by nursing staff is commonly used to arouse the apneic infant and so stimulate breathing. This raises the question of whether frequent physical stimuli might reduce the number of apneic events. Furthermore, some believe that the preterm infant is deprived of the frequent stimuli that would be felt in utero and that substituting these with an oscillating mattress to provide kinesthetic stimulation might improve growth and development. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-15 09:32:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If prolonged, apnea can lead to hypoxemia and reflex bradycardia which may require active resuscitative efforts to reverse. There are clinical concerns that these episodes might be harmful to the developing brain or cause dysfunction of the gut or other organs. Frequent episodes may be accompanied by respiratory failure of sufficient severity as to lead to intubation and the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</P>

<P>Ten trials were identified, seven of which failed to meet inclusion criteria (see table 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies'). Three trials were included (<LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK>) that compared a form of kinesthetic stimulation to control for the treatment of apnea of prematurity. Details of each study have been entered into the table of included studies. All three studies enrolled preterm infants with established apnea with exclusion of secondary causes, and not currently on any treatment with a respiratory stimulant. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK>, it was unclear as to how many apneas were required to be eligible for enrolment.

<P>All three studies were crossover trials with alternating periods of treatment and control in the infants studied. <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> is a two-period crossover trial, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK> were multiple crossover trials, each studying four consecutive alternating periods.</P>
<P>The type of kinesthetic stimulation differed between the three trials. <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> examined the effect of an irregularly oscillating water bed (12 to 14/min); <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> examined the effect of a regularly rocking bed tray (10 to 22/min); and <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK> examined the effect of a 'vertical pulsating stimulus' (blood pressure cuff placed under the thorax inflated 12 to 20/min).</P>
<P>Apnea and bradycardia were recorded by nursing staff (monitors set for apnea &gt;20 seconds duration and bradycardia &lt; 80 bpm) and by polygraphic recording of apnea (&gt;10 seconds) and bradycardia (&lt; 80 bpm) in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK>. Apnea (&gt; 12 seconds), bradycardia (&lt; 100 bpm) and transcutaneous oxygen were recorded by polygraphic recording (with the researcher at the bedside) in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK>. Apnea and bradycardia were recorded by nursing staff (monitors set for apnea &gt; 15 seconds and bradycardia &lt; 100 bpm), and by polygraphic recording (apnea &gt; 15 seconds and bradycardia &lt; 100 bpm) in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data could be extracted only from the study by <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> to calculate the number of apneas (&gt; 20 seconds) in 24 hours.</P>

<BR/>Clinically significant reductions in apnea: No study reported a clinically significant reduction in apnea consistent with the prespecified criteria in this review. For apnea &gt; 20s, <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> using the oscillating water bed reported no significant difference in number of infants with &gt; 4 / day or &gt; 9 / day (Outcomes 1.1, 1.2). For apnea associated with bradycardia, <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> reported no significant difference in number of infants with &gt; 4 / day or &gt; 9 apneas / day (Outcomes 1.3, 1.4). For apnea associated with bradycardia, <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> reported no significant difference in the number of infants having a &lt; 50% reduction in frequency of apnea (Outcome 1.5). <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> using the rocking bed reported frequency of apneas (&gt; 12 seconds) associated with bradycardia (&lt; 100 bpm), number of apneas associated with hypoxia (TcP02 &lt; 50 mmHg), and number of apneas requiring stimulation in infants on the rocking bed. However, the events for individual patients were combined and individual patient data were not available from the author to determine if there was an important reduction in clinical apnea.</P>
<P>Other reported apnea: Using a lower threshold (&gt; 25% reduction), <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> reported less apnea and bradycardia in infants on the oscillating water bed (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02, 0.91) (Outcome 1.6). For apnea associated with bradycardia, both <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> found significant reductions in the number of infants with more frequent episodes. <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> reported reductions in the frequency of apneas (&gt; 12 seconds) associated with bradycardia (&lt; 100 bpm) whereas <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> reported apnea &gt;15s associated with bradycardia &lt;80bpm / day. Meta-analysis of these two studies found a significant reduction in the number of infants with more frequent episodes (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03, 0.42) (Outcome 1.7). No outcome could be extracted from the study using the 'vertical pulsating stimulus' by <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK> that was consistent with the definition of clinically important apnea. <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK> reported the number of episodes of apnea &gt; 15s / day and found a significant reduction (MD -15.78, 95% CI -21.20, -10.36) in infants whilst receiving the 'vertical pulsating stimulus' (Outcome 1.8). <LINK REF="STD-Korner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Korner 1978</LINK> reported the number of episodes of apnea &gt;15s associated with bradycardia &lt; 80 bpm / day and found no significant difference (Outcome 1.9). <LINK REF="STD-Tuck-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuck 1982</LINK> reported a significant reduction in apnea &gt; 12s associated with hypoxia (TcO2 &lt; 50 mmHg) (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.85) (Outcome 1.10), but no significant difference in the frequency of apnea requiring stimulation (RR 0.20, 0.03, 1.47) (Outcome 1.11).</P>
<P>Other events: <LINK REF="STD-Jirapaet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapaet 1993</LINK> reported that no infants required resuscitation or ventilation in either group. Adverse events such as death, intraventricular haemorrhage and neurodevelopmental follow-up were not reported.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-10-27 11:35:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 11:35:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from these studies that kinesthetic stimulation is effective in producing a clinically important reduction in clinically important apnea of prematurity (&gt; 20 seconds duration or a shorter apnea associated with bradycardia or cyanosis), or in reducing clinically important outcomes such as need for IPPV, CPAP or respiratory stimulants.</P>
<P>However, using a lower threshold that has uncertain clinical significance, the trials indicate that kinesthetic stimulation reduces the rates of apnea (with or without associated bradycardia and hypoxia) in infants with apnea of prematurity. The results were consistent despite the use of three different methods of providing kinesthetic stimulation.</P>
<P>This review suggests that kinesthetic stimulation is effective at reducing apnea and bradycardia in infants with apnea of prematurity. Whether it produces a clinically important reduction in clinical apnea of prematurity remains unproven. Previous reviews have suggested that kinesthetic stimulation is not effective at preventing apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2005</LINK>) and is not as effective as theophylline in treating clinically significant apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-10-15 10:03:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of the small number of infants enrolled in the three trials included in this review, measures of effect are imprecise and a small benefit of kinesthetic stimulation in reducing clinically important apnea is not precluded. The three trials used different methods of kinesthetic stimulation, and different definitions for apnea and bradycardia. </P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-10-15 10:01:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limitations of the studies included in this review are their small sample size (the three eligible trials included only 49 babies in total) and the use of a crossover design which removes the ability to measure effects on late outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-10-15 10:03:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is hindered by the clinical heterogeneity of the eligible trials, which limits the ability to synthesize their results. It has not been possible for the reviewers to obtain individual patient data or dichotomous data for some clinically important outcomes. These would be needed for synthesis of data on these outcomes. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend kinesthetic stimulation as treatment for clinically important apnea of prematurity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A further trial of kinesthetic stimulation compared to control using clinically important outcomes and with adequate power is required before kinesthetic stimulation can be recommended to treat clinically important apnea with or without bradycardia.</P>
