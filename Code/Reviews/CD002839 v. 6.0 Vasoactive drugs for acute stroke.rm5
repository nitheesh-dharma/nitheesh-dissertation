<P>In patients who have just had a stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds) very high and very low blood pressure may be harmful. Drugs which raise low blood pressure or lower high blood pressure might benefit acute stroke patients. This review of 43 trials involving 7649 participants found that there was not enough evidence to decide if drugs which can alter blood pressure should or should not be used in patients with acute stroke. More research is needed.</P>

<P>We identified 131 trials involving in excess of 18,000 patients; a further 13 trials are ongoing. We obtained data for 43 trials (7649 patients). Among BP-lowering trials, beta receptor antagonists lowered BP (early systolic BP (SBP) mean difference (MD) -6.1 mmHg, 95% CI -11.4 to -0.9; late SBP MD -4.9 mmHg, 95% CI -10.2 to 0.4; late diastolic BP (DBP) MD -4.5 mmHg, 95% CI -7.8 to -1.2). Oral calcium channel blockers (CCB) lowered BP (late SBP MD -3.2 mmHg, 95% CI -5.4 to -1.1; early DBP MD -2.5, 95% CI -5.6 to 0.7; late DBP MD -2.1, 95% CI -3.5 to -0.7). Nitric oxide donors lowered BP (early SBP MD -10.3 mmHg, 95% CI -17.6 to -3.0). Prostacyclin lowered BP (late SBP MD, -7.7 mmHg, 95% CI -15.6 to 0.2; late DBP MD -3.9 mmHg, 95% CI -8.1 to 0.4). Among BP-increasing trials, diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) increased BP (early SBP MD 15.3 mmHg, 95% CI 4.0 to 26.6; late SBP MD 15.9 mmHg, 95% CI 1.8 to 30.0). None of the drug classes significantly altered outcome apart from DCLHb which increased combined death or dependency (odds ratio (OR) 5.41, 95% CI 1.87 to 15.64).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:28:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is not enough evidence to evaluate reliably the effect of altering BP on outcome after acute stroke. However, treatment with DCLHb was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Beta receptor antagonists, CCBs, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin each lowered BP during the acute phase of stroke. In contrast, DCLHb increased BP.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:29:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:28:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the commonest cause of disability in the western world. Acute stroke, whether due to infarction or haemorrhage, is associated with high blood pressure in 75% of patients of whom 50% have a previous history of high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-International-Society-of-Hypertension--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">International Society of Hypertension 2003</LINK>). The mechanisms underlying hypertension in stroke are complex but pre-existing hypertension (present in 50% to 60% of patients), hospitalisation stress, activation of the neuro-endocrine pathways, and the Cushing reflex, each contribute (<LINK REF="REF-International-Society-of-Hypertension--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">International Society of Hypertension 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2005</LINK>). Low blood pressure is not common in acute stroke but it, like high blood pressure, is associated with a poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vemmos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemmos 2004</LINK>). Possible reasons for low blood pressure include potentially reversible conditions such as hypovolaemia, sepsis, impaired cardiac output secondary to cardiac failure, arrhythmias or cardiac ischaemia, and aortic dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although debated more than 20 years ago, it still remains unclear whether hypertension should<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Spence-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 1985</LINK>) or should not<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Yatsu-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yatsu 1985</LINK>) be treated acutely following stroke. Recent guidelines recommend that acute lowering of blood pressure should be delayed for several days or even weeks unless blood pressure is higher than 220/120 mmHg, higher than 200/100 mmHg with end organ involvement (hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, cardiac ischaemia, pulmonary oedema, acute renal failure), or higher than 200/120 mmHg with primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_HS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-HS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>). Though the evidence is weak (class 1, level of evidence B) guidelines now recommend that patients who have elevated blood pressure and are otherwise eligible for treatment of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) may have their blood pressure lowered so that systolic blood pressure (SBP) is &#8804; 185 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is &#8804; 110 mmHg before thrombolysis using intravenous labetalol, nitropaste or nicardipine and it should be maintained below 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours after therapy<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>). Similarly, guidelines recommend that causes of low blood pressure in the setting of acute stroke should be sought with a view to correcting reversible causes such as hypovolaemia and cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:28:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A number of small studies have assessed the relationship between blood pressure and outcome. A meta-analysis of these and other studies found that elevated blood pressure was associated with a poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2004</LINK>). Data from 17,398 patients in the International Stroke Trial (IST) identified a U-shaped relationship such that both low and high blood pressure was associated independently with increased early death and later death or dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>). A high blood pressure is also associated with increased early recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2006</LINK>). In ischaemic stroke, hypertension also appears to affect adversely through increasing the risk of cerebral oedema, but not haemorrhagic transformation (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>) as shown in the IST analysis. Haematoma expansion is related to high blood pressure in patients with PICH although this relationship may be confounded by stroke severity and time to presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2003</LINK>). Since cerebral autoregulation is lost following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paulson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paulson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strandgaard-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strandgaard 1973</LINK>) such that cerebral blood flow becomes dependent on systemic blood pressure, some researchers have hypothesised that blood pressure should be increased (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 1992</LINK>) after stroke to improve perfusion to the penumbral region, and several case series and small trials have been published. In a recent meta-regression of blood pressure in acute stroke involving data from randomised controlled trials, large increases or reductions in blood pressure were associated with harm whereas moderate reductions were associated with a non-significant reduction in death or dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:29:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This systematic review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that would be expected, on pharmacological grounds, to alter blood pressure in patients within one week of the onset of acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. A related review restricted inclusion to those trials which specifically studied the effect of changing blood pressure in acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-BASC-I" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC I</LINK>). The aim of this review is to assess the effect of lowering or elevating blood pressure in people with acute stroke, and the effect of different vasoactive drugs on blood pressure in acute stroke.</P>

<P>We identified and independently assessed published and unpublished trials and decided whether to include or exclude them. One review author (CG) identified data in published material and sought additional information from the principal investigators of the trials where necessary. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

We recorded information on the methods of randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding, analysis (intention-to-treat or efficacy analysis), stroke type (ischaemia or haemorrhage), drug dose, route of administration (oral, transdermal or intravenous) and timing, blood pressure and heart rate (before and during treatment), numbers of deaths, functional disability, quality of life, length of stay, and adverse effects such as hypotension,</P>

<P>The trials involved 16 combinations of drug classes and routes of administration: oral or sublingual angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (perindopril, captopril and lisinopril); oral angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) (candesartan); oral beta receptor antagonists (&#946;RA) (atenolol, propanolol); combined alpha and beta receptor antagonists (labetalol); oral thiazide diuretics (bendrofluazide), intravenous CCBs (flunarizine, isradipine, nimodipine); oral CCBs (nimodipine, nicardipine); intravenous DCLHb (a haemoglobin analogue); intravenous magnesium sulphate; intravenous naftidrofuryl; transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (a nitric oxide donor); intravenous piracetam; combined intravenous prostacyclin; intravenous glucose potassium insulin (GKI); intravenous insulin; intravenous phenylephrine; and intravenous and or oral mixed antihypertensive therapy (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients were recruited into trials within six to 168 hours from stroke onset; most were enrolled within 24 to 168 hours (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Nine studies included patients who were hypertensive at the time of recruitment (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>); the other studies involved patients with a range of BPs.

This strategy is recommended by the Cochrane Stroke Group and avoids artificially inflating patient numbers and therefore narrowing confidence intervals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blood pressure</HEADING>
<P>Baseline SBP was mismatched between the treatment and control groups across all treatments (MD -1.6 mmHg, 95% CI -2.8 to -0.4) and especially for intravenous CCBs (MD -6.6 mmHg, 95% CI -13.4 to 0.2) (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Several drug classes lowered BP, including: beta receptor antagonists (early SBP, MD -6.1 mmHg, 95% CI -11.4 to -0.9; late SBP MD -4.9 mmHg, 95% CI -10.2 to 0.4; late DBP MD -4.5 mmHg, 95% CI -7.8 to -1.2); oral CCBs (late SBP MD -3.2 mmHg, 95% CI -5.4 to -1.1; early DBP MD -2.5, 95% CI -5.6 to 0.7; late DBP MD -2.1, 95% CI -3.5 to -0.7); nitric oxide donors (early SBP MD -10.3 mmHg, 95% CI -17.6 to -3.0), and prostacyclin (late SBP MD -7.7 mmHg, 95% CI -15.6 to 0.2; late DBP MD -3.9 mmHg, 95% CI -8.1 to 0.4).</P>
<P>BP lowering is also seen for several other antihypertensive agents although the small number of participants studied meant that differences in BP were not always statistically significant. Drugs showing hypotensive properties included: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, bendrofluazide, intravenous CCBs and GKI. Neither magnesium, naftidrofuryl nor piracetam had appreciable effects on BP. <LINK REF="STD-INTERACT-pilot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT pilot 2008</LINK> lowered SBP (early MD -14.0 mmHg 95% CI -17.2 to -10.8, late MD -11.0 mmHg, 95% CI -14.0 to -8.0) in the intensive treatment versus guideline treatment arm.</P>
<P>In contrast, DCLHb increased BP (early SBP MD 15.3 mmHg, 95% CI 4.0 to 26.6; late SBP MD 15.9 mmHg, 95% CI 1.8 to 30.0). Intravenous phenylephrine also showed a trend towards an increase in SBP (MD 20.6, 95% CI -13.3 to 54.5) as compared to control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heart rate</HEADING>
<P>Heart rate was lowered by beta blockers (early heart rate (HR) MD -6.8 beats/minute, 95% CI -9.6 to -4.0; late HR MD -9.3 beats/minute, 95% CI -12.0 to -6.6); and oral CCBs (late HR MD -2.8 beats/minute, 95% CI -3.9 to -1.7); and increased by nitric oxide donors (MD 6.3 beats/minute 95% CI 2.9 to 9.7). Intravenous CCBs, ACE inhibitors, naftidrofuryl, magnesium, and DCLHb did not alter heart rate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death or dependency</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of an effect on death for any agent except DCLHb which significantly increased the odds of death or dependency (OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.87 to 15.64). A trend for an increase in combined end of trial death or disability was observed for oral CCBs (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% CI 0.91 to1.86).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hypotensive events</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference for oral CCBs (total events four active, six control, OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.74) and mixed antihypertensive therapy (total events five active, six control, OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.7) in the number of hypotensive events.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:30:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Beta receptor antagonists, oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs), glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), prostacyclin and mixed antihypertensive therapy lowered blood pressure (BP) during the first three days of treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, bendroflumethiazide, intravenous CCBs, insulin and GKI also appeared to lower BP as compared to the controls. In contrast, magnesium, naftidrofuryl, and piracetam had no effect on BP. Nevertheless, these observations may be partly confounded by mismatches in baseline BP (significantly so for intravenous CCBs). Baseline imbalances in BP would have profound effects on outcome and therefore change the BP-outcome relationship. A definitive assessment as to whether these drugs change BP will be dependent on analysis of individual patient data from these trials. Unfortunately, individual patient data were not available for most of the included trials; the presence of these data would have addressed this issue. Further, the apparent BP-reducing effect of GKI may be due to the confounding in the GIST trial, in which the controls were treated with intravenous saline, and the treatment group received intravenous dextrose, so the BP difference may not be attributable to the GKI lowering BP, but to the control group having less hypovolaemia/hypotension because of the saline (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the drug classes altered outcome apart from diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) which significantly increased combined death and dependency compared with control. There was no significant difference in outcome for CCBs, beta blockers, ACE-I, magnesium, and nitric oxide. The relationship between BP and outcome could not be studied for methodological reasons in the present review. However, the relationship between BP and outcome based on many of the included trials has been assessed in a meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Geeganage-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2009</LINK>). The results revealed a U-shaped relationship between BP changes and outcome, with the lowest risk of death or combined death or dependency at the end of follow up in patients with BP reductions ranging from eight to 15 mmHg. Although large falls or increases in BP were associated with a higher risk of poor outcomes, a modest reduction may reduce death and combined death or dependency, although confidence intervals were wide and compatible with an overall benefit or hazard.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-01 13:30:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Trials of vasoactive drugs in acute stroke reveal that beta receptor antagonists, oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs), glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), prostacyclin and mixed antihypertensive therapy each lower blood pressure (BP). In contrast, diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) and phenylephrine increases BP. However, these data do not allow the effect of changing BP on outcome to be assessed. In the absence of definitive information, there is no clear indication for the deliberate alteration of BP during the first few days after stroke.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-12 10:19:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The existing completed studies of vasoactive drugs in acute stroke are all small or medium sized (fewer than 1000 participants) and, hence, likely to be underpowered. One or more large trials (several thousand participants) are now required to determine whether altering (raising or lowering) BP can be safe and efficacious; such studies are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INTERACT-2-2007" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT 2 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCAST-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SCAST 2005</LINK>).</P>
