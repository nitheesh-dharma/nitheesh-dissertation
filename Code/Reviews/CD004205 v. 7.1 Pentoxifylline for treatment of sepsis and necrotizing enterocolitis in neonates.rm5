<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does the use of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy prevent death and other serious complications in newborn babies with suspected or confirmed sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sepsis is a bacterial or fungal infection of the blood. NEC is a condition with gastrointestinal tract injury and infection seen in premature babies. Modifying the body's response (inflammation) to infection may decrease deaths and tissue injury after sepsis or NEC. Pentoxifylline is a drug that decreases inflammation and possibly tissue injury. We reviewed the effects of pentoxifylline in newborn sepsis and NEC.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Six randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>We found low-quality evidence that pentoxifylline in combination with antibiotics decreases deaths and duration of hospital stay in newborn sepsis. Pentoxifylline treatment did not affect lung, eye, or brain injury as a result of sepsis (very low-quality evidence). We identified no adverse effects due to pentoxifylline. There were no completed studies looking at pentoxifylline treatment in NEC. We need better-quality evidence on the use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of sepsis or NEC in the newborn.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2014), PubMed (January 1966 to May 2014), CINAHL (January 1982 to May 2014), Science Citation Index (January 1990 to May 2014), and BIOSIS (January 1992 May 2014) in May 2014. We checked references and cross-references from identified studies. We handsearched abstracts from the proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies Meetings (from January 1990 to May 2014). We placed no restrictions on language.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pentoxifylline used as an adjunct to antibiotics in neonates with sepsis decreased all-cause mortality during hospital stay (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; NNTB 13, 95% CI 7 to 100; 6 studies, 416 participants, low-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses revealed decrease in mortality in preterm infants, infants with confirmed sepsis, and infants with gram-negative sepsis (low-quality evidence, four studies). Pentoxifylline decreased length of hospital stay (MD -7.59 days, 95% CI -11.65 to -3.52; 2 studies, 148 participants, low-quality evidence). Pentoxifylline did not change the risk of development of NEC, chronic lung disease, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, or periventricular leukomalacia in neonates with sepsis (one to two studies, very low-quality evidence). Pentoxifylline therapy compared to pentoxifylline and immunoglobulin M-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin M-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin alone did not change mortality or development of NEC in neonates with sepsis (one study, very low-quality evidence). We noted no adverse effects due to pentoxifylline. We identified no trials evaluating pentoxifylline treatment for NEC.</P>

<P>Low-quality evidence from six small studies suggests that pentoxifylline therapy as an adjunct to antibiotics in neonatal sepsis decreases mortality without any adverse effects. We encourage researchers to undertake large, well-designed multicentre trials to confirm or refute the effectiveness of pentoxifylline in reducing mortality and morbidity in neonates with sepsis or NEC.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-09 11:03:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-09 11:03:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>Neonatal sepsis is the most common cause of neonatal deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2006</LINK>). The incidence of neonatal sepsis in the developed world is reported to be between 1 to 4 cases per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004a</LINK>), but in the developing world it is significantly higher (6.5 to 38 per 1000 live births) (<LINK REF="REF-Zaidi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaidi 2005</LINK>). The incidence of neonatal sepsis is inversely proportional to gestational age and birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2004</LINK>). Early-onset sepsis (sepsis in infants less than 72 hours of life) occurs in 1.5% to 1.9% of very low-birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight 401 g to 1500 g) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2005</LINK>). In a cohort of 6956 VLBW infants admitted to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network hospitals for the period of 1998 to 2000, 21% had 1 or more blood culture-proven late-onset sepsis (onset after 72 hours of life) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). Mortality of infants with late-onset sepsis was 18% (36% for those infected with gram-negative organisms), and morbidities (including patent ductus arteriosus, prolonged ventilation, prolonged need for intravascular access, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, NEC, and length of hospital stay) were significantly higher in infected infants. Sepsis significantly affects long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, either by direct infection of the central nervous system or as a result of inflammatory injury. In a large cohort study of 6093 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight less than 1000 g), infected infants had a significantly higher incidence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up, characterized by cerebral palsy, low scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and vision impairment when compared with uninfected infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>NEC occurs in about 1% to 5% of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The most consistent risk factors are prematurity and low birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2006</LINK>). The pathogenesis of NEC is not entirely clear. Gastrointestinal immaturity, enteral feeding (especially formula feeding), presence of bacteria, and inflammation all play a part in the development of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2006</LINK>). Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) and platelet-activating factor are the most important among pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been implicated in the development of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caplan-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 1990a</LINK>). The pivotal role of TNF-&#945; in NEC is supported by the fact that, in an animal model, monoclonal antibody to TNF-&#945; reduced incidence of NEC from 80% to 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 2006</LINK>). Mortality from NEC is high (15% to 30%), and 20% to 40% of infants with NEC undergo surgery. Infants who had NEC have delayed neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality and morbidity due to sepsis and NEC remain high despite the use of potent antimicrobial agents (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2005</LINK>). Increased use of antimicrobials has led to a global emergence of antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1998</LINK>). Adjunct therapies may be important in increasing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory response may be responsible for the multi-organ dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response seen in sepsis. The balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may determine the severity and ultimate outcome in sepsis syndromes and NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Edelson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2005</LINK>). Recent evidence has also shown that inflammation plays an important role in cerebral and pulmonary injury (<LINK REF="REF-Speer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2006</LINK>), especially in the preterm neonate. When used in conjunction with antibiotics, immunomodulating agents may help to re-establish the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and may influence clinical outcome in neonatal sepsis and NEC.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pentoxifylline, a xanthine derivative, is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses TNF-&#945; production by adenyl cyclase activation and increased cellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate concentration. Pentoxifylline has attracted increased interest since the discovery that inhibition of tumour necrosis factor gene transcription reduces mortality from sepsis. TNF-&#945; increases peroxidation of arachidonic acid, activates polymorphonuclear leukocytes, increases eicosanoids, and increases its own production, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Vilcek-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilcek 1991</LINK>). Inhibition of TNF-&#945; production by pentoxifylline negates this response and thereby may improve outcome. Pentoxifylline also has beneficial effects on endothelial cell function and coagulation in sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Boldt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boldt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pentoxifylline has been shown to have beneficial effects in humans and animal models of sepsis and NEC. In sepsis, pentoxifylline has been shown to improve haemodynamics (including renal blood flow) and to prevent transition from a hyperdynamic to a hypodynamic response (<LINK REF="REF-Krysztopik-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krysztopik 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeni 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bacher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1999</LINK>). Pentoxifylline also ameliorates inflammatory lung injury after endotoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Michetti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michetti 2003</LINK>). In adults and neonates, pentoxifylline has been shown to decrease serum levels TNF-&#945;, interleukin-1, and interleukin-10, but not interleukin-6 or interleukin-8 (<LINK REF="REF-Bienvenu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bienvenu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeni 1996</LINK>). In a rat model of NEC, pentoxifylline reduced the incidence and severity of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Travadi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travadi 2006</LINK>). To date, no significant adverse effects have been reported in either animal or human studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standardised review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Review authors independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the standard criteria developed by The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We independently assessed the risk of bias for randomised trials using table 8.5a of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) based on the following six domains:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection bias</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Method of sequence generation: Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation: Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Performance bias: Due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study.</LI>
<LI>Detection bias: Due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors.</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias: Due to amount, nature, or handling of incomplete outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias: Due to selective outcome reporting.</LI>
<LI>Any other sources of bias or important concerns not addressed in the previous domains.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We resolved all discrepancies by discussion and consensus. If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>In addition to the assessment of risk of bias, we rated evidence from included studies using the GRADE methodology as very low, low, moderate, or high. We used the five GRADE considerations to rate evidence: risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-09 11:06:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-09 11:06:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>We identified six randomised controlled trials that reported on our prespecified neonatal outcomes. These trials randomised 416 newborn infants with sepsis to pentoxifylline, placebo, or IVIG. Low-quality evidence from these trials suggested a decrease in all-cause mortality during hospital stay, and the NNTB indicated that 13 infants need to be treated to prevent 1 neonatal death. In subgroup analyses of all-cause mortality during hospital stay, pentoxifylline therapy decreased neonatal deaths due to confirmed sepsis, confirmed gram-negative sepsis, in late-onset sepsis, and in preterm infants (low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence from 2 trials (148 participants) suggested a decrease in length of hospital stay. Very low-quality evidence from one to three studies suggests that pentoxifylline therapy does not change the neonatal outcomes of development of NEC, chronic lung disease, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, or periventricular leukomalacia.</P>
<P>One study reported on comparisons of pentoxifylline with pentoxifylline and IgM-enriched IVIG and IgM-enriched IVIG alone in 102 participants. There were no differences in all-cause mortality or development of NEC for those comparisons (very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of pentoxifylline including haematological adverse effects affecting platelet, leukocyte, and red cell function were not observed in the included trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The six randomised controlled trials were performed in neonatal intensive care units in Poland, Egypt, Turkey, and India. Four of these studies suffered from a high risk of bias, namely selection, detection, and attrition biases. However, all these trials evaluated neonates with sepsis, including preterm infants and infants with proven sepsis. The small sample sizes and low evidence quality decrease generalisability and applicability of evidence.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-07 08:25:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We rated four studies at high risk of bias and two studies at low risk of bias. We downgraded the evidence from six studies for the outcome 'all-cause mortality during hospital stay' to low quality based on GRADE methodology of evaluating evidence. The reasons for downgrading included high risk of bias in the included studies and the imprecision of the summary estimate. We also downgraded the evidence for the outcome 'length of hospital stay' to low because of evidence from only two studies, of which one had a high risk of bias. We downgraded the evidence for the outcomes of chronic lung disease, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity to very low because only a few studies reported this data, and the summary estimate was imprecise with large confidence intervals. Only one study reported comparisons of pentoxifylline with IVIG alone or with pentoxifylline plus IVIG, and the summary estimate was imprecise.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We strove to decrease biases in the review process. Two review authors performed the literature search using an inclusive search strategy and combined their results. Our search strategy identified six randomised clinical trials reporting neonatal outcomes. Our post-hoc analysis of retinopathy of prematurity did not change our conclusions. We pursued the investigators of published randomised controlled trials for data and missing information with limited success.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Harris, et al. reviewed the use of pentoxifylline in preterm neonates who had sepsis (two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-randomised study, and two observational studies) or NEC (one case series) (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2010</LINK>). The review authors also included cohort and observational studies and did not synthesize data into a meta-analysis. The review authors acknowledged that the included studies were small with significant methodological limitations, hence better-quality evidence is needed. There are no other systematic reviews on the use of pentoxifylline in sepsis in the neonatal or paediatric populations.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-09 11:06:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>Low-quality evidence from six small randomised controlled trials suggests that pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in neonatal sepsis decreases mortality during hospital stay without adverse effects. Low-quality evidence from two trials suggests a decrease in the length of hospital stay. However, as the included trials have considerable methodological weaknesses, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. We identified no completed trial using pentoxifylline for the treatment of NEC.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-06 03:00:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers should be encouraged to undertake adequately powered, well-designed, multicentre randomised controlled trials to confirm or refute the role of pentoxifylline in treatment of neonatal sepsis and NEC. The trials should report on clinically important comorbidities of sepsis (for example chronic lung disease, periventricular leukomalacia, and duration of assisted ventilation, among others) and long-term neurological outcomes. Researchers may consider comparing pentoxifylline with other adjunctive modalities that decrease inflammatory injury in the treatment of neonatal sepsis and NEC.</P>
