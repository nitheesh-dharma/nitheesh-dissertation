<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 02:36:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In IVF and ICSI embryos are selected for transfer on the basis of morphological criteria. Unfortunately, many women fail to become pregnant after an IVF or ICSI treatment. A reason for this could be that the number of chromosomes present in the embryos selected for transfer is abnormal, even though they are 'of good quality'. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) is a technique used to identify the number of chromosomes present in embryos created through IVF or ICSI. After PGS, only embryos with a normal number of chromosomes for the chromosomes tested are transferred. PGS has been suggested to improve live birth rates. This review shows that PGS in fact decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and in women with repeated IVF failure. PGS should not be applied in routine patient care. New forms of PGS that perform the procedure at other stages of development and/or use a different method of analysis should first be evaluated in clinical trials before being introduced into clinical practice.</P>

<P>In both IVF and ICSI, selection of the most competent embryos for transfer is based on morphological criteria. However, many women fail to achieve a pregnancy even after 'good quality' embryo transfer. One of the presumed causes is that such embryos show an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidies). In preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), only euploid embryos are transferred, with the goal of increasing live birth rates.</P>

<P>In this updated review, the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to July 2010. This was supported by checking reference lists of included studies and conference abstract books. Authors were contacted for additional data when necessary.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-08-02 10:40:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were selected. They were eligible for inclusion if they compared IVF/ICSI with PGS versus IVF/ICSI without PGS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-12-18 05:38:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Relevant data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Trials were screened and analysed according to predetermined quality criteria and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. The primary outcome measure was live birth rate per woman. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of women reaching embryo transfer, mean number of embryos transferred, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and proportion of women whose child has a congenital malformation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-16 02:32:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine trials met the inclusion criteria. Live birth rate per woman was significantly lower after IVF/ICSI with PGS compared to IVF/ICSI without PGS in women of advanced maternal age and in women with repeated IVF failure (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81 and OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88 respectively). In good prognosis patients a similar trend was seen, albeit not significant (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.26, random effects model).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 02:35:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PGS as currently performed significantly decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and those with repeated IVF failure. Trials in which PGS was offered to women with a good prognosis suggested similar outcomes. PGS technique development is still ongoing in an effort to increase its efficacy. This involves biopsy at other stages of development (polar body or trophectoderm biopsy) and other methods of analysis (comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) or array-based technologies) than used by the trials included in this review. These new developments should be properly evaluated before their routine clinical application. Until such trials have been performed, PGS should not be offered as routine patient care in any form.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-19 13:57:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-19 13:57:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In both in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) selection of the most competent embryo(s) for transfer is based on morphological criteria, such as the number of pronuclei, the number and regularity of blastomeres and the percentage of fragmentation. Even so, many women fail to achieve a pregnancy after transfer of embryos which are morphologically of good quality.</P>
<P>One of the presumed causes is that such morphologically normal embryos contain an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidies). Since the early 1980s many reports have been published showing numerical chromosome abnormalities in morphologically normal human cleavage stage embryos (<LINK REF="REF-Angell-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benadiva-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benadiva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delhanty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delhanty 1997</LINK>). Since most aneuploid embryos are expected to not develop to term, preimplantation genetic screening for aneuploidies (PGS) was introduced to improve pregnancy rates.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-20 11:44:56 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In PGS, embryos created in vitro are analysed for aneuploidies and only those that show a normal number of chromosomes, i.e. those that are euploid for the chromosomes tested are transferred into the uterine cavity. There are three approaches to obtain nuclear material for this genetic analysis. One approach is aspiration of the first and second polar body from fertilized oocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Verlinsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlinsky 1995</LINK>). Another approach is removal of one or two blastomeres from embryos at the early cleavage stage (<LINK REF="REF-Handyside-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handyside 1989</LINK>). A third approach is removal of trophectoderm cells at the blastocyst stage (<LINK REF="REF-Dokras-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dokras 1990</LINK>). The method of analysis can be limited to a certain number of chromosomes (usually using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)) or it can encompass all chromosomes (using comparative genomic hybridisation or array based technologies). PGS has thus far been conducted mostly at the cleavage stage using FISH (<LINK REF="REF-Goossens-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossens 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>PGS has often been called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for infertility or PGD for aneuploidies (PGD-AS). Although the technology used in PGS and PGD is nearly identical, PGS and PGD have completely different indications. PGS aims to improve treatment outcome in subfertile couples undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, while PGD aims to prevent the birth of affected children in fertile couples with a high risk of transmitting genetic disorders.</P>
<P>At first PGS was recommended and carried out for the following indications: (i) advanced maternal age (<LINK REF="STD-Gianaroli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gianaroli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahraman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahraman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Obasaju-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obasaju 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Munne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montag-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montag 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platteau-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platteau 2005</LINK>) (ii) repeated IVF failure (<LINK REF="STD-Gianaroli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gianaroli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahraman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahraman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pehlivan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pehlivan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilding-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilding 2004</LINK>) (iii) repeated miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 1999</LINK>; ; <LINK REF="REF-Rubio-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubio-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 2005</LINK>) (iv) severe male factor (<LINK REF="REF-Silber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silber 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platteau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platteau 2004</LINK>). More recently PGS has been offered to younger women with a good prognosis for a pregnancy too, as high aneuploidy rates were found in their embryos as well (<LINK REF="REF-Baart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baart 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goossens-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossens 2009</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-05 02:18:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only embryos that are euploid for the chromosomes tested are transferred into the uterine cavity. It is presumed that this is likely to increase the live birth rate by excluding embryos that would most likely not implant or not develop to term.<BR/>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:25:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Although IVF/ICSI with PGS has been increasingly used over the past decade (<LINK REF="REF-Goossens-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossens 2009</LINK>) and indeed in some centres has become a standard treatment for some indications, its effectiveness is still unclear. Therefore this systematic review was undertaken and updated to investigate whether there is a difference in live birth rate. This involved comparing IVF/ICSI with PGS to IVF/ICSI without PGS.</P>

<P>In addition three upcoming randomised controlled trials were identified, Two of these trials are currently recruiting patients (www.controlled-trials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov). One trial, performed in women of advanced maternal age defined as an age between 37 and 42 is suspended because of lack of funding. In one trial the indication is repeated IVF failure, defined as &#8805; 2 previous IVF failures with the transfer of at least two quality embryos per transfer. The last trial performed PGS in women of advanced maternal age, defined an age between 38-44. All trials use FISH for a limited number of chromosome and biopsy will take place at cleavage stage.</P>

There were no trials that analysed all chromosomes or that used other techniques than FISH.</P>
<P>In all studies, in the control group the morphologically best embryos were transferred, in the intervention group embryos that were found to be chromosomally normal were transferred. In one study undetermined embryos with good morphologic features were transferred if no chromosomally normal embryos with good morphologic features were available (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>), in the other studies undetermined embryos were not transferred. Though in one study, one embryo was transferred in which no result was obtained for chromosomes 16 and 18 due to technical difficulties, and one embryo was transferred in which the chromosomal pattern was only evaluated in one nucleus while this study normally removed and investigated two embryos (<LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two trials one embryo was transferred (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>), in one trial two embryos were transferred if there were two embryos available (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>), in one trial one or two embryos were transferred according to the patients' wishes and the availability of normal embryos (<LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>), and in one trial up to three embryos were transferred (<LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>). In one trial the number of embryos transferred depended on the age of the woman, namely up to three blastocysts when the patient was between 37 and 39 years old and up to a maximum of six blastocysts if the patient was 40 years or older (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>). In one trial a maximum of two to three embryos were transferred before 1 July 2003, and only one embryo after 1 July 2003 in the first IVF/ICSI attempt in patients younger than 36 years (<LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>). In two trials transfer policy was not described (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoolcraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoolcraft 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on cryopreservation and pregnancies originating from frozen/thawed embryos was only available in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>). In one of these trials only one embryo transfer was performed in the PGS group and two in the control group, although many more embryos were cryopreserved (<LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>). In this study, one pregnancy was obtained in the PGS group after a mixed transfer of both a non-biopsied embryo (from a previous IVF cycle) and a biopsied embryo, so no conclusion concerning the origin of the embryo could be made. In this study no pregnancies were obtained in the control group. In the other trial four ongoing pregnancies were obtained in the control group, and no pregnancies were obtained in the PGS group (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>). .</P>

For one trial the primary outcome was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Schoolcraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoolcraft 2009</LINK>). Implantation rate was defined as the ratio between the number of gestational sacs with a fetal heartbeat and the total number of embryos transferred. However, this is an inappropriate outcome measure since the denominator (number of embryos transferred) depends on the strategy, not on the design and since it is not a randomised outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Mastenbroek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mastenbroek 2005</LINK>). It is also an inappropriate outcome since it introduces a unit of analysis error and analysis fails to account for non-independence in outcomes between separate embryos transferred to the same woman (<LINK REF="REF-Mastenbroek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mastenbroek 2005</LINK>).<BR/>The primary outcome measure of this review, live birth rate per woman was reported in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>).

In four trials the calculated number of inclusions was not reached. In one trial the study was ended prematurely because an interim analysis showed such a lower implantation rate for the PGS group it was considered unethical to continue (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>), in one trial the study was ended prematurely because an interim analysis showed futility (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>), and one trial was ended prematurely because the trend was opposite to that required to disprove the null hypothesis and because in the control group many more cryo stored blastocysts were accumulating (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>). In one trial the study was ended prematurely because an interim analysis showed a very low conditional power of superiority for the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>). In three studies the power calculation was based on embryos instead of women (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one trial there was a difference in embryo transfer policy between the PGS group and the control group. In the PGS group embryo transfer was performed on day five while in the control group transfer was performed on day three (<LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>). In one study in three women in the control group embryo transfer was erroneously planned at day three instead of day five (<LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>), in an other study four embryo transfers in the control group were erroneously planned at day three instead of day five (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study of Staessen et al. published in 2004 400 women were randomised, 200 were assigned to the PGS group and 200 to the control group. In the PGS group one woman did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, in the control group 10 women did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 199 versus 190 women were correctly assigned to the treatment and control group respectively. In 51 women in the treatment group and 49 women in the control group ovum pick-up was not performed. In the original article these women were excluded from the analysis, but we included these women in an intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore from this article, we included a total of 199 women in the PGS group and 190 women in the control group.</P>
<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>, 95 women were randomised to the PGS group and 105 women were randomised to the control group. In the PGS group eight women did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, in the control group 10 women did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and we excluded those from the meta-analysis. The authors excluded nine women in the PGS group and 11 women in the control group because of wrong allocation and a spontaneous pregnancy . Therefore, a total of 87 versus 95 women were correctly assigned to the treatment and the control group respectively. Nine women in the PGS group and 10 women in the control group were wrongly allocated, these women should be included in an intention-to-treat-analysis. This was not possible because the results of their treatment are unknown to us. The authors further excluded six women in the PGS group and 18 women in the control group because of insufficient ovarian response, stop further fertility treatment and spontaneous pregnancy. These women should be included in an intention-to-treat analysis but this was not possible for the same reason as mentioned above. Therefore from this article, we included a total of 72 women in the PGS group and 67 women in the control group.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK> four women were excluded from the analysis because no embryo transfer was performed for personal reasons. In the original article these women were excluded from the analysis, but we included these women in an intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore from this article, we included 23 women in the PGS group and 24 women in the control group.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK> 52 women were randomised to the PGS group and 52 women were randomised to the control group. However, women could be included several times with independent randomisation for each cycle, this introduces a bias since these cycles are not independent. After excluding these cycles, i.e. when each women could be included only once 44 women could be included in the PGS group and 50 women could be included in the control group (Debrock, personal communication). Fifteen women in the PGS group and 28 women in the control group did not receive the intended treatment, we included these women in an intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore from this analysis, we included 44 women in the PGS group and 50 women in the control group.</P>
<P>One study reported only percentages and used transfers and pregnancies as units of analysis, therefore we recalculated the numbers per patient for the various outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Schoolcraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoolcraft 2009</LINK>). From this article, we included 32 women in the PGS group and 30 women in the control group.</P>

By doing this, poor responders were excluded.

For a control group rate of 26%, these data suggest a live birth rate after PGS of between 13% and 23%. There was no indication for statistical heterogeneity.

For a control group rate of 26%, these data suggest an ongoing pregnancy rate after PGS of between 13% and 24% (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies were not included in the analysis of women reaching embryo transfer because in these studies only women with a minimal number of good quality embryos on day three were included, thereby excluding women with poor or average ovarian response and a higher risk for not reaching embryo transfer (<LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoolcraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schoolcraft 2009</LINK>).

The mean number of embryos transferred was significantly different in favour of the control group (Mean difference -0.22; 95% CI -0.30 to -0.14; P &lt; 0.00001). There was statistical heterogeneity, the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 87% (see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). This could partly be explained by the fact that the maximum embryos for transfer was much higher in one study, namely up to six if a woman was 40 years or older (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>) as compared tot the other studies, where the maximum of embryos for transfer was two or three. However, if this study was excluded from the analysis the I<SUP>2</SUP> was still high, namely 73%.</P>
<P>Four trials had data on clinical pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the PGS group (19%, 96 out of 505) than in the control group (29%, 144 out of 495) resulting in an OR of 0.56 ( 95% CI 0.41 to 0.75; P = 0.0002) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 0%. For a control group rate of 29%, these data suggest a clinical pregnancy rate using PGS of between 14% and 24%. (see <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>The multiple pregnancy rate per live birth was not significantly different between the PGS and the control group. A total of 15 twin and one triplet pregnancies were reported in the PGS group, with one twin pregnancy resulting from a vanishing triplet pregnancy, versus 24 twin pregnancies and three triplet pregnancies in the control group. Two triplet pregnancies were reduced to a singleton pregnancy and one to a twin pregnancy, which ended in a singleton pregnancy. This results in an OR of 1.04 (4 studies; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.13). The I<SUP>2</SUP> was 0% (see <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>All five trials also reported on miscarriage rate per woman randomised. The miscarriage rate was not significantly different between the PGS (11%, 58 out of 537) and the control group (12% ,64 out of 525), with an OR of 0.87 ( 95% CI 0.59 to 1.27) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 0% (see <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported data on women reaching embryo transfer after cryopreservation of embryos. In the PGS group significantly less women reached embryo transfer after cryopreservation of embryos (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.90). However in both of these trials many more embryos were cryopreserved than transferred at the time of publication, suggesting many embryos were still available to be transferred.</P>
<P>In the PGS group there was one trisomy 18 (after spontaneous conception), one intrauterine death (due to abruptio placentae) and one premature delivery of twins at 24 weeks of gestation, resulting in the postpartum death of both children (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>). In the control group there was one Down syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>, personal communication) one trisomy 18, one conception with a cleft lip and palate and one intrauterine death of a fetus (<LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>). In one study there were no malformed children (<LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>, personal communication). The other studies did not report on pregnancy outcome.</P>

<B>(2) PGS for repeated IVF failure</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>) examined PGS for repeated IVF failure. There were 72 women included in the PGS group and 67 women were included in the control group.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>Live birth rate per woman was significantly lower in the PGS group (21%, 15 out of 72) than in the control group (39%, 26 out of 67) with an OR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; P = 0.02). For a control group rate of 39%, this suggests a live birth rate using PGS of between 6% and 36%.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary outcomes</I>
<BR/>The ongoing pregnancy rate per woman was significantly lower in the PGS group (21%, 15 out of 72) than in the control group (39%, 26 out of 67) with an OR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; P = 0.02).</P>
<P>The proportion of women reaching embryo transfer was significantly lower after PGS (76%, 55 out of 72) than in the control group (94%, 63 out of 67) with an OR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.65; P= 0.007).</P>
<P>The mean number of embryos transferred per transfer was significantly different in favour of the control group (weighted mean difference -0.70; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.34; P = 0.0001)).</P>
<P>The clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly different between the PGS (25%, 18 out of 72) and the control group (40%, 27 out of 67), with an OR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.02; NS). For a control group rate of 40% this suggests a clinical pregnancy rate using PGS of between 9% and 40%.</P>
<P>Multiple pregnancy rate was not significantly different between the PGS and the control group. In the PGS group 3 twin pregnancies were reported. In the control group 10 twin pregnancies were reported (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.78; NS).</P>
<P>The miscarriage rate was not significantly different between the PGS (14%, 10 out of 72) and the control group (7%, 5 out of 67), with an OR of 2.00 (95% CI 0.65 to 6.19; NS).</P>

</P>
<P>Three trials were included that evaluated PGS in primarily good prognosis patients (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>) In total, 198 women were analysed in the PGS treatment group and 190 women were analysed in the control group. Two studies performed biopsy at the cleavage stage (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>) and one studies performed biopsy at the blastocyst stage (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>). Odds ratios were calculated for all studies together and performed subgroup analyses based on the moment of biopsy.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>All four trials provided data on live birth. The combined live birth rate per woman was significantly lower in the PGS group (32%, 63 out of 198) than in the control group (402%, 79 out of 190) resulting in an OR of 0.64 ( 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97, P = 0.03). However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity as shown by the inconsistency measure (I-squared = 71%). When pooling the data using a random effects model no difference in live birth rate could be proven (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.26, P = 0.12). In the subgroup analysis live birth rates were significantly lower after PGS at the blastocyst stage (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.90, P = 0.03). When PGS was performed at the cleavage stage the live birth rate was also lower after PGS, but this was not significant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47-1.25, P = 0.29) (see <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<I>Secondary outcomes</I>
<BR/>Ongoing pregnancy rate per woman was only reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>), therefore no meta-analysis could be performed. The ongoing pregnancy rate was not significantly different between the PGS (31%, 37 out of 120) and the control group (33%, 39 out of 120), with an OR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.60, P = 0.78).</P>
<P>Three trials provided data on the number of women reaching embryo transfer. The combined proportion of women reaching embryo transfer after PGS at the cleavage stage was not significantly different between the PGS (81%, 160 out of 198) and the control group (83%, 157 out of 190), with an OR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.42, P = 0.49) and the I-squared was 0% . For a control group rate of 83%, these data suggest a proportion of women reaching embryo transfer after PGS of between 73% and 88%. The proportion of women reaching embryo transfer in all three trials is high in comparison to other trials in which PGS is performed for other indications. This is most likely because only women with a minimum of good quality embryos were included, thereby excluding women with poor or average ovarian response and a higher risk for not reaching embryo transfer. (see <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials provided data on clinical pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>). The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the PGS group (35%, 70 out of 198) than in the control group (46%, 87 out of 190) resulting in an OR of 0.63 ( 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95; P = 0.03), and the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 0%. For a control group rate of 46%, these data suggest a clinical pregnancy rate using PGS of between 26% and 45%. In both subgroups (PGS at the cleavage stage and PGS at the blastocyst stage) the clinical pregnancy rate was lower after PGS, but this was not significant (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.43-1.15 and OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.21-1.04 respectively). (see <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>)</P>
<P>In the study by Staessen et al. one multiple pregnancy occurred in the PGS group versus two multiple pregnancies in the control group (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.04-5.61). All multiple pregnancies occurred despite the fact that single embryo transfer was applied. In the other studies multiple pregnancy rate was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>) or it was only provided as a percentage and it was not possible to recalculate this into exact numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials provided data on miscarriage (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>). The miscarriage rate was not significantly different between the PGS and the control group. The combined miscarriage rate per woman randomised was 10% (20 out of 198) in the PGS group versus 9% (17 out of 190) in the control group, resulting in an OR of 1.17 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.30). There was substantial statistical heterogeneity as shown by the inconsistency measure (I-squared = 65%). When pooling the data using a random effects model there was also no difference in miscarriage rate (OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.76). For a control group rate of 9%, these data suggest a miscarriage rate using PGS of between 3% and 24%. In both subgroups (PGS at the cleavage stage and PGS at the blastocyst stage) the miscarriage rate was not significantly different between the PGS and the control group (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.17-14.82 (random effects model) and OR 4.50; 95% CI 0.51-39.99 respectively). (see <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>)</P>
<P>One study reported that no major or minor congenital abnormalities were detected in any of the children and that there were no chromosomal abnormalities (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2009</LINK>). In the other two studies abnormalities in the live born children were not mentioned.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-06 02:25:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review on the effectiveness of PGS nine trials for three indications could be included. All trials used FISH for the analysis. Live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate were significantly lower after IVF/ICSI with PGS as compared to IVF/ICSI without PGS in women of advanced maternal age and in women with repeated IVF failure. Trials in which PGS was offered to good prognosis patients suggested similar outcomes. Similar results were found in the trial with blastocyst stage biopsy as in the trials with cleavage stage biopsy.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-11-19 22:43:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The observation that significantly more women reached embryo transfer and that significantly more embryos were transferred per transfer in the control group in women of advanced maternal age and in women with repeated IVF failure can be explained by the fact that in the PGS group all chromosomal abnormal embryos were excluded for transfer, while in the control group all embryos are in principle available for transfer. Of the embryos tested 41.5%, 49.7%, 63%, 67.3% and 69.7% were found to be chromosomally abnormal, and therefore not suitable for embryo transfer in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Mastenbroek-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mastenbroek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardarson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hardarson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debrock-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Debrock 2010</LINK> respectively. In good prognosis patients there was no difference in the proportion of women reaching embryo transfer. This is not surprising since only women with a minimum number of good quality embryos were included, thereby excluding women with a higher risk for not reaching embryo transfer.</P>
<P>The transfer of significantly more embryos in the control group could explain the increased number of multiple pregnancies in this group, though this difference was not statistically different.</P>
<P>There are several possible explanations for the lower number of ongoing pregnancies and live births after PGS found in this review. First, the technique itself, or more precisely the use of a laser or acidic tyrode's to create a hole in the zona pellucida and the removal of one or more blastomeres could hamper the potential of the embryo to successfully develop and implant (<LINK REF="REF-Tarin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, the use of FISH for the analysis could result in false-positive or false-negative diagnosis. Scoring errors of FISH signals may arise from loss or damage of nuclear material, overlapping signals, split signals, diffused signals, hybridisation failure and probe inefficiency. FISH analysis has in general a 92-99% accuracy per probe, so when using a multi-probe panel on one blastomere, there is always the risk of misdiagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeUgarte-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeUgarte 2008</LINK>), thereby possibly incorrectly including or excluding embryos for transfer. Furthermore, only a limited number of chromosomes can be tested by FISH, thus embryos labelled as normal after PGS could in fact be aneuploid for one or more chromosomes not tested.</P>
<P>Third, the chromosomal constitution of the cell analysed does not necessarily represent the embryo, as mosaicism is common in human preimplantation embryos (<LINK REF="REF-Coonen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coonen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staessen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Staessen 2004</LINK>). This could lead to the transfer of non-viable embryos and the discarding of potentially viable embryos.</P>
<P>Because of the disappointing results of PGS thus far, the technique is continuously under development to improve the accuracy of PGS. This involves either a different timing of the embryo biopsy or the use of more advanced genetic analysis to determine the genetic content of a single cell. Some advocate that biopsy at the blastocyst stage may allow sampling of representative genetic material without compromising embryo viability (<LINK REF="REF-Munne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munne 2009</LINK>). However, in the only randomised controlled trial that performed PGS at the blastocyst stage live birth rates were lower after IVF/ICSI with PGS (<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 2008</LINK>), similar to the trials included in our review where PGS was performed at the cleavage stage. Polar body biopsy may offer another alternative to blastomere biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Montag-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montag 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geraedts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geraedts 2010</LINK>). This approach has the advantage that the integrity of the embryo remains unaffected as polar bodies play no major role in further embryonic development. A disadvantage of PGS using polar bodies is its inability to detect chromosome errors of paternal and/or post zygotic origin. However, the overall paternal contribution to the aneuploidy risk of an embryo derived from assisted reproduction has been suggested to be low with more than 90% of all aneuploidies being of maternal origin (<LINK REF="REF-Montag-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montag 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Alternatives for the use of FISH, such as methods based on comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), or the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008</LINK>). These techniques allow simultaneous screening of all chromosomes. Although this possibly improves the detection of abnormalities in a single cell, it still has to be weighted against possible harm by the biopsy procedure and the presence of mosaicism (<LINK REF="REF-Mastenbroek-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mastenbroek 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanneste-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanneste 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering the outcomes of our review these new developments should properly be evaluated before their routine clinical use by method assessment studies, followed by pilot-studies showing a potential benefit in terms of live birth per woman and subsequent randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this analysis shows that PGS as currently performed significantly decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and in women with repeated IVF failure. New trials on PGS should be preceded by proper method assessment and pilot-studies showing a potential benefit in terms of live birth per woman. Until such trials have been performed, PGS should not be offered as routine care in any form.</P>
