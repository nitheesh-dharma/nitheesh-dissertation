<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-21 02:57:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ureaplasmas are normal flora in the vagina of many women. In some women high levels of ureaplasma in the vagina, which probably reflect the presence of infection in the uterus, may have a role in pregnancy complications, or may contribute to babies being born before full term (preterm birth), or both. These babies can have serious health problems. Some antibiotics can be safely used during pregnancy and are also active against ureaplasma. The authors identified only one trial (involving 1071 women) that was eligible for inclusion in this review. Therefore, there is insufficient data to assess whether giving antibiotics to women with ureaplasma in the vagina reduces the risk of preterm birth.</P>

<P>Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality.

<P>We included one trial, involving 1071 women. Of these, 644 women between 22 weeks and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to one of three groups of antibiotic treatment (n = 174 erythromycin estolate, n = 224 erythromycin stearate, and n = 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) or a placebo (n = 427). Preterm birth data was not reported in this trial. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined, n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). There were no statistically significant differences in side effects sufficient to stop treatment between either group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to assess whether pregnant women who have vaginal colonisation with ureaplasma should be treated with antibiotics to prevent preterm birth.</P>
<P>Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem. Upper genital tract infections, including ureaplasmas, are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes; this may result in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-21 03:04:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth (less than 38 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Gravatt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravatt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2000</LINK>). Globally, preterm birth occurs for approximately 13 million babies annually (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2010</LINK>). Rates vary by many factors, including country of birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1997</LINK>), sociodemographic variables, race and ethnic groups. The causes of most spontaneous preterm birth are unknown and are most likely a complex relationship of causality (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2010</LINK>). Known causal pathways tend to vary by gestation. Between the 22nd and 32nd week, inflammation caused by infection occurs commonly (<LINK REF="REF-Gravatt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravatt 2010</LINK>). There is some evidence suggesting that genital colonisation, infections, or both, including with ureaplasmas, contribute to preterm labour and preterm rupture of membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Genital colonisation with ureaplasmas is common, and are normal flora carried by up to 80% of healthy women (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1997</LINK>). They are usually harmless, presumably because the organisms stimulate a mucosal antibody response which controls their numbers and prevents local tissue invasion. In a small proportion of colonised women, ureaplasmas are found in the vaginal fluid in relatively high concentrations, presumably because they are poorly controlled by the host immune response. This may lead to ascending infection and subacute or chronic endometritis and contribute to infertility; and during pregnancy to complications such as spontaneous abortion or chorioamnionitis; and preterm birth may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1995</LINK>). Whatever the mechanism, there is an association between preterm birth and ureaplasma colonisation or infection of the amniotic fluid, membranes, placenta and the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ureaplasmas are the commonest isolates, often in pure culture, from the amniotic fluid and placentas of women who deliver prematurely and their presence is strongly associated with histological evidence of chorioamnionitis (<LINK REF="REF-Cassell-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassell 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1988</LINK>). They are more commonly isolated from the respiratory tract of extremely preterm than from term infants, and their presence often is associated with congenital pneumonia and chronic neonatal lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cassell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hannaford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaford 1999</LINK>). Despite these associations, prospective studies have not shown a consistent association between lower vaginal colonisation and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Cassell-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassell 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1992</LINK>). Moreover, treatment during pregnancy has not consistently reduced the incidence of preterm birth (<LINK REF="STD-Eschenbach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Eschenbach 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>). A 1995 review of two trials concluded that "there is no evidence currently to support the routine treatment at any stage of pregnancy of women found to be positive for <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum</I> to prevent prematurity" (<LINK REF="REF-Smaill-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 1995</LINK>). The most likely explanation for the apparently contradictory findings is that the causes of preterm birth are multifactorial. There is evidence that other types of infection, including bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia and group B streptococcal infection, may predispose to preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>) and only a subset of women colonised with ureaplasmas is at risk of complications. Vaginal colonisation per se is a poor predictor of risk, but a cohort study showed that high-density vaginal ureaplasma colonisation (more than 1000 colony forming units/ml) was a risk factor for chorioamnionitis and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Abele_x002d_Horn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abele-Horn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are one of the few agents active against ureaplasmas and can be safely used in pregnancy. Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are active against ureaplasmas but not used in pregnancy. For women with spontaneous preterm labour and intact membranes, treatment with antibiotics confers no clear benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2002</LINK>). However, for women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes treatment with antibiotics results in prolongation of pregnancy and lower risks of neonatal infection although the longer term health benefits are unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It may be possible to prevent the inflammatory cascade which is believed to lead to spontaneous preterm labour, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes and preterm birth; however, we first need to identify women with abnormal genital colonisation who are at increased risk of infection and identify an appropriate treatment schedule suitable for use in early in pregnancy to eradicate their infection. The effectiveness of such treatment is likely to be affected by the type of antibiotic, the timing in pregnancy, dosage, duration of treatment and the route of administration. The purpose of this review is to assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with ureaplasma in the vagina reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-07-21 17:54:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified one eligible study for this review (<LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1987</LINK>), which between 1971 and 1980, enrolled pregnant women who after vaginal culture were positive for <I>Mycoplasma hominis</I> and/or <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum</I>, and whose gestations were between the 22nd and 32nd week. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either erythromycin estolate or stearate, clindamycin hydrochloride or placebo. Treatment was changed approximately half way through the study (in 1975). Erythromycin estolate was shown to be related to slight reversible elevations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (transaminase) levels, and clindamycin hydrochloride to excessive diarrhoea and other symptoms. These two treatments were stopped and patients were, from then on, randomised to receive 250 mg erythromycin stearate or placebo. Therefore, final numbers were unevenly distributed: 174 women received erythromycin estolate, and 246 clindamycin hydrochloride before they were discontinued. After the change in treatment, 224 women received erythromycin stearate and 427 placebo.</P>
<P>Treatment non-adherence was assessed and defined as having taken less than 50% of the capsules or having missed capsules for four (or more) consecutive days. Women who did not adhere to treatment schedule were excluded. There were no significant differences in adherence between either of the treatment arms. Laboratory evidence of toxicity was sought and measured at the two visits (two and four weeks after treatment commenced), and was also an exclusion criterion. Women who had symptoms which may have been due to the study treatment were also excluded from some analyses. The primary outcome measure and sample size calculations were not reported. The only outcome reported for all women randomised was number of women who discontinued treatment and the reason for discontinuation (including side effects). Data on mean birthweight and the rate of low birthweight (less than or equal to 2500 grams) were reported for all women who were randomised to erythromycin (either estolate or stearate) and placebo. <I>See </I>also <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. All other outcomes had loss to follow-up for more than 20% of participants and thus we have excluded these data from the review.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-07-21 17:55:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted methodological details of the one eligible and included study from the published paper only (<LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1987" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1987</LINK>). Randomisation was reported but the method of concealment was not stated. A placebo was used, and it is reported that all capsules were identical and had been dispensed in bottles identified only by a code number, thus suggesting that participants were blinded to their treatment.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis was not conducted (except for two outcomes) as women who did not satisfactorily comply with treatment were excluded. Participants were excluded after enrolment and randomisation if they had not taken any of the treatment, had taken less than half of their treatment, had missed treatment on four (or more) consecutive days, or had symptoms that were related to the study drug. Sufficient follow-up was only available for two of the secondary outcomes; 'side-effects sufficient to stop treatment' data available for all women, and 'low birthweight' was available for women randomised to erythromycin (either preparation ) or placebo.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-07-21 17:55:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the one eligible trial, a total of 1105 women were enrolled between the 22nd and 32nd weeks of gestation. Of these 34 were identified as being not evaluable post-randomisation: 12 birthed twins, six were not pregnant, and 16 were lost to follow-up. Thus the remaining 1071 women were compared. Of these, 644 received antibiotic treatment (174 erythromycin estolate, 224 erythromycin stearate and 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) and 427 received a placebo. The uneven distribution of the groups can be explained through the change in treatment approximately halfway through the study; erythromycin estolate and clindamycin hydrochloride were prematurely stopped and erythromycin stearate replaced these. Over 50% of women were excluded from the analysis due to poor adherence; however, for two secondary outcomes, data for all women were collected and are included in this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There were no data to assess the effectiveness of antibiotics in reducing the incidence of preterm birth among women with ureaplasma in the vagina.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Data were only available for two secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>'Low birthweight less than 2500 grams': there was no statistically significant difference between the group randomised to erythromycin (either preparation) or placebo group (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). Data from 825 women contributed to this outcome: erythromycin combined groups (n = 174 + 224) and the placebo group (n = 427).</P>
<P>'Maternal side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment': there was also no statistically significant difference between the antibiotic groups (combined) and the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85), although women who were taking any antibiotic were more likely to report symptoms that were sufficient to stop (erythromycin estolate 10.9%, erythromycin stearate 8.9% and clindamycin hydrochloride 11.0%). Data from 1071 women contributed to this outcome.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-22 10:19:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The data for this review are insufficient to assess the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating ureaplasma colonisation in the vagina to reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>Although other studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria for this review, ureaplasma was not an essential entry criterion (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1998</LINK>). Some studies have reported a post hoc subgroup analysis of ureaplasma (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Ogasawara-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ogasawara 1997</LINK>). We have not included these studies, as the publication of post hoc subgroup analyses usually implies that a positive result was found and therefore introduces bias. Another trial met the inclusion criteria but did report the number of women randomised or excluded and subsequently only included data on subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Eschenbach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Eschenbach 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been no new trials investigating this intervention in this population since the late 1990s and although the role of infection in preterm birth continues to be an important question, the actual mechanism of the infection cascade needs to be better understood before intervention questions such as type of treatment, dosage and gestation can be answered. Equivocal results of antibiotic treatment suggest that we do not yet understand the mechanism.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-21 18:15:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of vaginal colonisation of <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum </I>remains unknown and intervention trials are unlikely while the precise causal pathway remains unclear. To test the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in this group of women, a large well-designed trial is needed. However given the high prevalence of <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum </I>in the population, it is important to identify those women at risk of preterm birth before the commencement of a treatment trial.</P>

<P>Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for inclusion in the review. We assessed the methodological quality of each trial to be included according to criteria in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (Clarke 2003), with a grade allocated to each trial on the basis of allocation concealment: A (adequate), B (unclear), C (clearly inadequate). We documented details regarding randomisation method, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement for all trials. We excluded quasi-randomised designs, such as alternate allocation and use of record numbers. We resolved any differences of opinion regarding trials for inclusion by discussion. We made an a priori decision to exclude data from outcomes that were unavailable for more than 20% of participants.</P>
<P>Three reviewers independently extracted the data using prepared data extraction forms. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. We performed statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>). We analysed categorical data using relative risk, risk difference and number needed to treat.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management  </HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a <I>[third]</I> assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator),</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or,</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.  We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by 1 to 5 above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.  We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see '</I>Sensitivity analysis'. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Dichotomous data</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.<I> </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Continuous data</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors<I> </I>using the methods described in the Handbook using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T<SUP>2</SUP>, I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if I<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than 30% and either T<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than zero, or there is a low P-value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by Egger 1997, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by Harbord 2006. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
