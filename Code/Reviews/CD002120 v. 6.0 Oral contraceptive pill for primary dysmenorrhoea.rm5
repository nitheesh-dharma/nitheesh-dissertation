<P>Dysmenorrhoea is painful menstruation (woman's monthly bleeding) with the symptoms including cramping, headaches, nausea and vomiting. An excess of the hormone prostaglandin is a known cause. The synthetic hormones in combined oral contraceptive pills suppress ovulation, which could result in a reduction in dysmenorrhoea. The OCP reduces the amount of prostaglandin produced by glands in the lining of the uterus; which then reduces both uterine blood flow and cramps. The preparations of OCP with doses less than 35 mcg were effective and should be the preparation of choice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-05 10:14:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>
<I>Description of the condition</I>
</P>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is the term for describing painful menstrual cramps. It is a common gynaecological problem that can affect as many as 50% of women, and 15% of these women suffer severely enough to temporarily render them incapacitated which, results in absences from work or school (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 2006</LINK>). The impacts are significant both in terms of quality of life and global economy. In the US alone it was estimated that there is an annual loss of 600 million work hours costing over 2 billion dollars (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1984</LINK>).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Dysmenorrhoea is commonly subcategorised into primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea. Menstrual pain without organic pathology is considered to be primary dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Coco-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coco 1999</LINK>). When the pelvic pain is associated with an identifiable pathological condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts, it is considered to be secondary dysmenorrhoea.</P>
<P>The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhoea is usually at or shortly after (6 to 12 months) menarche, when ovulatory cycles are established. The pain duration commonly ranges from 8 to 72 hours and is associated with menstrual flow. In contrast secondary dysmenorrhoea is more likely to develop years after the onset of menarche and occur premenstrually as well as during menstruation.</P>
<P>
<I>Aetiology of the condition </I>
</P>
<P>The aetiology (cause) of primary dysmenorrhoea has been the subject of considerable debate. Experimental and clinical research has identified the over-production or imbalanced amount of uterine prostaglandins as a substantial contributing factor to the painful cramps that are the major symptom of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 2006</LINK>). Prostaglandin production is controlled by progesterone; immediately prior to menstruation progesterone levels drop causing prostaglandin production to increase. If these prostaglandins are overproduced cramping can occur. The process of ovulation is also implicated; dysmenorrhoea mostly only occurs in ovulatory cycles, which helps explain why the initial onset of primary dysmenorrhoea occurs shortly after menarche, when ovulatory cycles become established (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Description of the intervention</I>
</P>
<P>Research as early as 1937 has shown that dysmenorrhoea responds favourably to ovulation inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Karnaky-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnaky 1975</LINK>), and that the synthetic hormones in the combined oral contraceptive pill can be used to manage dysmenorrhoea. These hormones act by suppressing ovulation and lessening of the endometrial lining of the uterus. Therefore menstrual fluid volume decreases along with the amount of prostaglandins produced, which then reduces dysmenorrhoea by decreasing uterine motility, and uterine cramping.</P>
<P>The use of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) has been advocated as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea since their introduction for general use in 1960. However this type of long term hormonal/endocrine therapy is viewed by some as only potentially useful if long term contraception is also desired (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1981</LINK>). OCP use for secondary dysmenorrhoea is also questioned, as although this type of treatment may have some favourable effect on dysmenorrhoea ultimately the organic cause of the pain must be addressed (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse effects of intervention</I>
</P>
<P>One potential drawback of the use of OCPs is the possible adverse effects that can accompany the two hormones used. Oestrogen related side effects may include nausea, vomiting, headaches, breast tenderness, and changes in body weight; progesteronic side effects may include acne, weight gain, increased hair growth, and depression. Citing a cause-and-effect relationship between OCPs and these adverse effects may be misleading as they are also observed in women with dysmenorrhoea. Placebo-controlled double-blind studies suggesting that many of these adverse effects can also occur with similar frequency in placebo-using control groups, and even in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Goldzieher-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldzieher 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldzieher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldzieher 1995</LINK>). More potentially serious complications of oestrogens are deep venous thrombosis (blood clotting in the veins), and arterial disease such as heart attacks and stroke, although these are rare. In order to lessen any potential side effects lower dose OCPs have been developed. In contrast to older OCPs, which contain 50-150 micrograms of oestrogen, modern pills are low dose (&lt;35 micrograms). The level of progestogen has also decreased along with a move from first or second generation progestogens (such as norgestrel, levonorgestrel, norethisterone) to third generation progestogens (such as desogestrel, gestodene) which are more selective and have different effects on metabolic parameters. Therefore combined OCPs can be categorised according to the level of oestrogen and the type of progestogen they contain.</P>
<P>
<I>How the intervention might work</I>
</P>
<P>Clinical trials show that OCPs effectively treat dysmenorrhoea by inhibiting ovulation and reducing prostaglandin levels. In an open trial of 661 women from the general population, 63% experienced dysmenorrhoea pre-treatment but after 12 months of OCP treatment only 12% still experienced dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Gauthier-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauthier 1992</LINK>). In an open clinical trial of a low dose OCP involving 100,000 women, of those who had dysmenorrhoea as a pre-existing condition, 65% (23,500 women) of the dysmenorrhoeic sample who were first time users of oral contraceptives felt relief from dysmenorrhoea as a result of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brill-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brill 1991</LINK>). Therefore there is some evidence in general populations that combined OCPs can effectively treat dysmenorrhoea.</P>
<P>
<I>Why it is important to do this review</I>
</P>
<P>Although combined oral contraceptives have long been promoted as the management for primary dysmenorrhoea, very few trials have been conducted to study efficacy and associated adverse events of their use. In addition, most of these trials are of poor methodological quality which exposes them to various biases. It is important to recognize that in this review.</P>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is a debilitating gynaecological condition that impacts significantly on women around the world. Not only does it cause great loss in personal health, but having to take time off work or school has also resulted in loss of productivity, eventually leading to economic loss. Proper management of dysmenorrhoea will therefore be beneficial to individuals and society.</P>
<P>There has also been a lot of debate around the issue of the risks of adverse events, if they were worth the benefits of OCPs in managing dysmenorrhoea. This review therefore aimed to establish the usefulness of OCPs in managing dysmenorrhoea in general population by comparing all relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>When extracting data from the trials for the outcome of pain relief it was decided a priori to only count substantial changes in pain as pain relief, if the trial reported sufficient data. For example the number of women changing from severe pain to mild or no pain would be included as experiencing pain relief, but not women changing from severe to moderate pain. The OR has been used for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. In the case of missing variance such as standard deviations the measure was imputed from the other similar studies. (The use of the imputation method was added in the update of 2008). </P>

A low p-value (or a large chi-squared statistic relative to its degree of freedom) provides evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects (variation in effect estimates beyond chance).

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-06-05 11:02:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Twenty three studies were considered for inclusion and ten met the inclusion criteria. One of the studies had three reports, the first related to pain outcomes and the second publication reported treatment discontinuation rates and losses to follow up of the original study and third providing further outcome data on pain and adverse events. (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>). Two of the studies reported some pain outcomes for a subgroup of women who had dysmenorrhoea but pain improvement and pain scores were not reported and therefore no data could be usefully extracted (<LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>TRIALS EXCLUDED FROM THE REVIEW<BR/>Thirteen studies were excluded. One excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Iannotti-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Iannotti 1991</LINK>) compared three treatments. Piroxicam (a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory), a triphasic estroprostogenic compound and a Vitamin D complex were given to all women for 5 months each in an uncontrolled, non-randomised trial; therefore the trial does not meet the prescribed inclusion criteria. Another excluded trial compared two monophasic and one triphasic combined oral contraceptives however allocation to each group was retrospective not random. Two excluded trials used combined oral contraceptives with 100mcg estrogen (<LINK REF="STD-Karasawa-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Karasawa 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kremser-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Kremser 1971</LINK>). It was recommended by the British Scowen committee in 1970 that combined OCPs with levels of estrogen this high be withdrawn from the market. By 1988 very high dose pills were discontinued by the major pharmaceutical companies. One of the excluded trials was a case control study (<LINK REF="STD-Kristjansdottir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kristjansdottir 2000</LINK>). Five studies included only small proportion of women with dysmenorrhea (<LINK REF="STD-Foidart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foidart 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reisman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Reisman 1999</LINK>) and one of the studies was excluded a none of the patients had dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Creatsas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Creatsas 1998</LINK>). One of the original studies was identified as not a truly randomised trial and was therefore excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1968</LINK>). A further study was not an RCT and was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Tallian-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tallian 1994</LINK>) (. <LINK REF="STD-La-Guardia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">La Guardia 2003</LINK> was an RCT comparing 5 different OCP preparations for efficacy, cycle control and safety and only described dysmenorrhoea as an adverse event. See table of excluded studies for more details.</P>
<P>TRIALS INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW</P>
<P>All assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were performed independently by the two reviewers (CW and CF) using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. This was done previously by the two original reviewers (MW and CF). Additional information on trial methodology or original trial data was to be sought from the principal author of trials. However, for the trials that were more than 20 years old this was not deemed to be feasible, therefore four of the authors were not written to as their trials (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>) were published more than 20 years ago.

<P>
<I>Study location and sources of women</I>
</P>
<P>The included studies originated from a wide variety of countries; USA, UK, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, France, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and the Netherlands. The women in the studies were also recruited from a variety of sources; student nurses, private practice patients and the local hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>); local telephone company, student nurses, university students and two hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>); general practitioner's patients (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>); hospital outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>); college students (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>). The remaining five studies did not state from where the women were recruited.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Selection of women<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Five studies included a number of women without dysmenorrhoea however it was possible to separate the information and data on these two groups and women without dysmenorrhoea were not included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>

<P>Six of the studies made explicit attempts in the form of clinical or pelvic exams to rule out pelvic pathology as a cause for dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>). One other study included very little information on the selection of women other than they had dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> stated that women had to be absent of disease but included no information on how this was assessed.</P>
<P>One study stated that pelvic examinations were not done to exclude secondary causes of dysmenorrhoea to avoid discouraging enrolments by younger adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>). The other study did not include any information on if any pelvic exams were done (<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>). Other exclusion criteria included planned or suspected pregnancy, contraindications to OCPs use, use of drugs that would interfere with pharmacokinetics of OCPs, recent miscarriage or abortion, abnormal genital bleeding, injectable hormonal contraceptives users, drugs use and abnormal genital bleeding.</P>
<P>
<I>Severity of dysmenorrhoea<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Two trials included women with any severity level of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>). Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>) clearly stated the severity levels of dysmenorrhoea that would be included and how this would be defined. <LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK> stated they would only include women with severe dysmenorrhoea defined as incapacitating pain for two or more days. <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK> stated they would include anything but mild dysmenorrhoea, which they defined as dysmenorrhoea that is relieved by analgesics and where no additional medication is normally required. <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK> stated they would include women with dysmenorrhoea that necessitated absence from duty. <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> stated that only women with history of Grade 2 or Grade 3 dysmenorrhoea would be included and Andersch and Milsom dysmenorrhoea assessment tool was used to establish the grading system. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> also used the Robinson modification of Andersch scale to classify the severity of dysmenorrhoea and would include women with moderate dysmenorrhoea, which is defined as sometimes or always experiencing very painful menstrual cramps, or severe dysmenorrhoea, which indicates sometimes or always cutting back on activities in addition to experiencing painful menstrual cramps. The remaining three trials questioned the women and categorised them into different severity levels (slight/mild, moderate, severe) based on the women own judgement without using formal definitions (<LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Outcome measures<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>All ten studies assessed the primary outcome of pain relief. <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK> assessed pain relief with a three point scale (complete, partial or none) at monthly intervals and reported these as total pain relief scores. <LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK> assessed pain relief by changes in dysmenorrhoea on a four point scale (from severe to mild, moderate or absent or no improvement), this assessment was based on pain relief after the final cycle of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK> assessed pain relief on a three point scale (complete, some, none) and reported scores for each month of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> assessed dysmenorrhoea as improved, unchanged or worse based on pain scores at the end of the two months treatment. Both <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> assessed pain relief with MMDQ on a five point Likert scale (0 = no experience of symptom, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong, 4= severe) and reported the outcome as the mean change of scores from baseline to last observed menses. <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK> questioned the women if they did or did not experience pain relief at 3 monthly intervals and reported the proportion of women who had experienced pain relief after the final cycle of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK> assessed dysmenorrhoea as complete relief, improved, no change or worsened and reported the monthly proportion of women with dysmenorrhoea in a graph form for six cycles of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK> reported the outcome for pain relief as improved or not improved.</P>

For two of the trials included in the meta-analysis for the comparison of 1st /2nd generation progestogens versus placebo, only women experiencing complete relief were included as those experiencing pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>); one trial was included that reported the number of women changing from severe pain to no pain/mild pain (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>); the other trial in the meta-analysis categorised women as those whose pain improved or did not improve (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>). This trial may be a source of heterogeneity as its categorisation of dysmenorrhoea was not as sophisticated as the other trials. For trials with different comparisons, one trial also grouped women as those whose pain improved or did not improve (<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>); one trial included those who experienced complete relief or improvement in pain as those experiencing pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>); the other trial reported the number of women who experienced relief or no relief (<LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies reported adverse effects by group (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>), additional use of analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>) and absence from work or school (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>) although three additional studies reported withdrawing from the study as a result of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>Withdrawals: For the <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK> trial a number of women dropped out of the trial before completing three months of treatment, therefore the meta-analysis only included those who completed three full months of treatment. Adverse events were not a reason for withdrawal. One study reported 4/22 women (18%) withdrawing from the final analysis, however two of these women were excluded due to breakthrough bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> had 23 drop outs out of the 322 women initially randomised, however only 213 of the 322 women had dysmenorrhoea and results were reported for only 203 of those women. Therefore dropouts from the dysmenorrhoea group were less than 10%, while dropouts from the overall trial were only 7%. Reasons given for withdrawals varied (from the overall group there were five pregnancies, six women who disappeared, four with somatic complaints such as bleeding, skin troubles or nausea, three with "interfering illness", and four who changed their minds). This data was not suitable for inclusion in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> reported 25/77 women (32%) not being included in the final analysis; four were excluded due to protocol violations, and the rest discontinued the treatment due to various reasons (non-compliance, personal reasons, pre-existing pregnancy and unknown reasons). The text specifically states that there were no withdrawals for adverse events. Only 7/76 women discontinued in <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> and only 2 of them were not included in the final analysis due to lost to follow up and pregnancy and three were for adverse events. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>) included women with no dysmenorrhoea in the trials, therefore although withdrawals of the women were mentioned, but no number was reported specifically for the dysmenorrhoea group. The percentage of withdrawals was therefore applied to the subgroup of women with dysmenorrhoea. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK> 13% of women withdrew and this percentage was assumed to apply to the women with dysmenorrhoea. <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK> stated that only 213 out of 1016 women initially randomised had dysmenorrhoea and 40 of them dropped out of the study prior to completion. Most common reasons for withdrawals were unacceptable bleeding problems and adverse events. The one remaining study did not report withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> trial, data on pain relief was reported as a percentage of the women in the group and these percentages had to be recalculated into numbers of women to be included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis for the comparison of 1st/2nd generation progestogens versus placebo, the placebo group for the <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> trial was evenly split between the three different types of progestogens evaluated in the trial. This was done to allow comparisons to be made and to ensure that the women in the placebo group were not over represented in the summary statistic.</P>
<P>
<I>Baseline comparability<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>One study failed to provide any data on the baseline comparability of the two intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>). The other studies compared the groups on a number of factors including; age, ethnicity, drugs history, alcoholic consumption, smoking habits, gynaecologic history, marital status, education, parity, pain, other symptoms, days off work or in bed, duration of pain and menses. Two studies reported a difference between the intervention groups; <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK> stated that the placebo group contained a slightly higher proportion of more severe cases but presented no data to confirm this statement and <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> stated that the placebo group had a lower percentage of women who required time off work or school due to dysmenorrhoea.</P>
<P>
<I>Types of compounds used </I>
</P>
<P>A number of different types of oestrogen/progestogen compounds were used and four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>) used medium doses of oestrogen and 1st or 2nd generation progestogens. Of these trials, mestranol 0.08mg and chlormadinone acetate 2mg taken sequentially was used in one arm of a trial and combined mestranol 0.1mcg and norethindrone was used in another arm and compared with a third placebo arm (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>). Mestranol 0.05mg and norethisterone 1mg was used in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>). 0.05 mg of mestranol is equivalent to 35mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Two other trials included 0.05mg ethinyl oestradiol with different levels of the progestogen norgestrel; 1mg, 0.5mg and 0.06mg (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>); 0.5mg (<LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining trials all used low doses of ethinyl oestradiol and 1st or 2nd or 3rd generation progestogens. <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> used two doses of ethinyl estradiol, 0.02mg and 0.01mg, and 0.15mg desogestrel. Ethinyl estradiol 0.02mg and desogestrel 0.15mg was used in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>) and they were compared against 0.075mg gestodene with same doses of ethinyl estradiol in two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>) while <LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK> used 0.03mg ethinyl estradiol combined with 0.075mg gestodene. The remaining two trials included 0.02mg ethinyl estradiol with 0.01mg levonorgestrel (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>), and 0.15mg gestodene was used as a comparison in <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Compliance<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Compliance with the treatment protocol was only assessed by five of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>). Assessment of compliance was done in different ways across different studies; by counting the pills or checking the pill packs (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>), by general questioning (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>), and referring to the diary cards or menstrual charts (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK> stated that compliance was assessed, but no information was provided on how it was done. <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> told women that urinary specimens may be taken at follow up visits to analyse hormone content in an attempt to ensure compliance but samples were not actually taken.</P>

<BR/>Three of the included studies were given an allocation score of A; <LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK> stated that randomisation was performed statistically by the pharmaceutical company via a secure code; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK> stated that locked files were utilised at onsite computer system to secure the randomisation list; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> stated that the randomisation list was prepared by an assistant who was not involved in the conduct of the study and they made sure that all the package was identical in appearance and had a unique ID number. Six of the included studies were assigned an allocation score of B, due to unclear methods (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>), one trial stated that allocation to each treatment group was random but gave no details (<LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>). The other trial stated that allocation was via the "envelop method" but gave no further details, this could refer to the use of opaque sealed envelopes but it is not enough detailed information to adequately assess allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>). The other included study was assigned allocation scores of B as due to a clerical error all the placebo pills had a different mark to the treatment pills meaning that identification of the groups (although not the actual assignment) was possible (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK> stated that the randomisation lists were managed centrally and were sent to the centres together with the trial medication and therefore was assessed as unclear.</P>
<P>
<I>Blinding<BR/>

<BR/>Double-blinding was used in six studies, and the remaining four trials were all open-label trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bassol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Endrikat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Endrikat 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serfaty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Serfaty 1998</LINK>). Blinding was unclear in the <LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK> study due to the fact that there were different markings on the two sets of pills which made it possible to identify pills used for treatment and placebo groups, although those allocating and receiving the pills were unaware of the meaning of the markings or that each set had different markings.<BR/>

The reason for the difference is that the smaller study by Davis was only in women with dysmenorrhoea and was a placebo controlled trial whereas the trial by Serfaty was a drug comparison study with a subgroup of women who had dysmenorrhoea.

<P>Two studies of low dose oestrogen and five studies of medium dose oestrogen combined OCPs compared with placebo, for a combined total of 497 women, reported pain improvement.

<P>The Chi-squared test for heterogeneity showed there is significant heterogeneity with an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 64% and a significant chi-square test (14.06, df=5, p=0.02).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-06-05 10:11:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea, and to compare the effectiveness of OCPs that use different levels and types of oestrogen and progestogen. The paucity of RCTs investigating oral contraceptives, despite their apparent widespread clinical use, has meant this review is unable to achieve this objective.</P>
<P>
<I>Summary of main results</I>
</P>
<P>Ten RCTs were included in this review and six compared different OCP preparations with placebo and 4 compared different preparations with each other. No studies compared OCP with the NSAIDs. Only two of our initial hypotheses could be commented on with the available data from the ten trials. The trials included in this review indicate that both low and medium dose oestrogen pills may be more effective than placebo treatment. There is no evidence of a difference between the different pill preparations although the 3rd generation pills may be more effective in pain improvement.</P>
<P>
<I>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Oral contraceptives are widely advocated as standard treatment for women with primary dysmenorrhoea yet this review has found only scant rigorous clinical evidence to support this practice. The evidence to employ OCPs in clinical practice for dysmenorrhoea seems to stem from studies designed to test the contraceptive efficacy of different brands of oral contraceptives or epidemiological studies. A longitudinal epidemiological study of over 500 nineteen year old Swedish women which compared the occurrence and severity of dysmenorrhoea in those taking combined oral contraceptives with non OCP or IUD users (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 1984</LINK>). These same women were also re contacted five years later at age twenty-five (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 1990</LINK>). The original study showed that those taking OCPs had reduced prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhoea compared with non-users. The follow-up study also showed that those women who did not use OCPs in the original study, but were now users had significantly reduced pain. Although changes in parity were controlled for, the overall result could be attributed to the passage of time rather than the efficacy of OCPs for dysmenorrhoea.</P>
<P>Another issue that needs to be considered is that the use of oral contraceptives as treatment for dysmenorrhoea does not just depend on their efficacy but also the suitability of oral contraceptives for the woman. If a woman wants a pregnancy or has contraindications to the OCP, then the OCP would be an unsuitable treatment option at that time.</P>
<P>The lack of reporting of adverse effects experienced by the women in the trials is problematic. Only three placebo controlled trials reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>There are also difficulties in extrapolating the results of this review to modern day populations as the majority of oral contraceptive pills prescribed today include much lower levels of oestrogen and progestogen and often different types of progestogens than some of the trials included in this review.</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of the evidence<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>The trials in the meta-analysis had various quality ratings, only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>) had adequately concealed the way the treatment was allocated, but the other trials were of poor quality in this respect, or did not report enough information to make an adequate assessment. Not all of the trials were double-blind and the one trial with a negative result had an error in the marking of the pills and identification may have been possible, although it was stated that double-blinding was used. Women with different levels of severity of dysmenorrhoea were included in the trials and different ways of assessing pain or pain relief were also used. Follow-up length and the timing of outcome assessment also differed, with one trial in the meta-analysis only reporting pain relief after one month of treatment, one trial after two months, and two trials after three months. These are all aspects that could contribute to the statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, although when inspecting the results of the meta-analysis the only trial that differs significantly in results is the GPRG trial.</P>
<P>Overall, three trials were methodologically sound (<LINK REF="STD-Cullberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cullberg 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>), but all of the other trials were of poor methodological quality and, in addition to that, three of them (<LINK REF="STD-GPRG-1968" TYPE="STUDY">GPRG 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buttram-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Buttram 1969a</LINK>) had small sample sizes.</P>
<P>
<I>Potential biases in the review process<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>There were methodological problems associated with quantifying and grading the pain of dysmenorrhoea. Assessment instruments used in quantifying dysmenorrhoea are based on patient's self report and as such are subject to obvious bias. In addition all the trials categorised pain using different scales, which may be a significant source of heterogeneity in this review.</P>

<P>Combined oral contraceptive pills of medium and low dose oestrogen with 2nd and 3rd generation progestogens may be more effective than placebo treatment for dysmenorrhoea but the interpretation of the results is limited because the variable quality of the RCTs included in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-09 20:54:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a paucity of RCTs of the combined OCP for dysmenorrhoea. There is only one trial of a low dose oestrogen OCP and further placebo controlled trials of the low dose OCP for pain improvement of dysmenorrhoea would be welcome. Comparisons with other standard medical treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories would also be useful. Any future trials would need to be double blind, randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes, and use objective pain outcome measures such as the visual analogue scale or Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaires (MMDQ).</P>
