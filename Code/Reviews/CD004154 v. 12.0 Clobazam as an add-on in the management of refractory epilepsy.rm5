<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Only four randomised controlled trials have been undertaken assessing add-on clobazam for refractory epilepsy. All are cross-over studies of short duration; they used differing designs and were of poor methodological quality. Results suggest that clobazam reduces seizure frequency for drug refractory partial epilepsy. There are limited and inconclusive data for generalized epilepsy. Cloabazam was also associated with adverse events.</P>

<P>Four cross-over studies, representing 196 participants, were included. However, due to significant methodological heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures it was not possible to summarise data in a meta-analysis.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Clobazam as an add-on treatment may reduce seizure frequency and may be most effective in partial onset seizures. However, it is not clear who will best benefit and over what time-frame.

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-13 12:45:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Epilepsy is a common condition affecting 1% of the population. Although many advances have been made in the management of these patients, a significant proportion of the population, up to 30% in some studies, continue to suffer with seizures refractory to even multiple combinations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Whilst there is no unifying definition of 'refractory' epilepsy, most definitions refer to continued seizures despite antiepileptic drug treatment, and the generally employed definition is of continued seizures despite interminable medication changes (<LINK REF="REF-French-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>The 1,4-benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, have a clear role in the acute management of epileptic seizures, however the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam has long been used as an adjunct to reduce seizure frequency (since having been initially investigated by Gastaut et al in 1979, once it had come off patent (<LINK REF="REF-Gastaut-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gastaut 1979</LINK>)). Animal studies suggest that the difference in its chemical structure, and that of its active metabolite N-desmethyl-clobazam, give it a broader spectrum of antiepileptic activity, inhibiting the spread of seizures and increasing the seizure threshold, compared to the classical benzodiazepines. Further disadvantages to the use of 1,4-benzodiazepines, for example, the retention of diazepam in fat stores and the short half-life of lorazepam, are not encountered with clobazam as the half-life of the active metabolite is between 35 and 133 hours, resulting in a steady relative concentration of clobazam: N-desmethyl-clobazam of 1:8. Furthermore, there is retention of the diazepam ring following metabolisation (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Whilst concerns have been raised regarding the long-term use of clobazam with regard to side effects such as sedation and the development of tolerance, the only data to support these claims comes from open, unrandomised trials, with widely ranging variation in the definition of 'tolerance'. The largest and most often cited trial was retrospective (<LINK REF="REF-CCCG-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCCG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, the sedative, muscle relaxant and behavioural effects are reported to be less marked than with diazepam and the other classical benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Kruse-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruse 1985</LINK>). In addition there has been some suggestion that, when used in conjunction with other AEDs, such as when managing cases of refractory epilepsy, there may be additive efficacy without additive toxicity, which may, in part, be due to increased concentrations of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl-clobazam, due to induction of hepatic enzymes by the other AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-Guberman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guberman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theis 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this literature review is to examine the efficacy of clobazam as an add-on treatment in the management of refractory cases of epilepsy, of partial onset with or without secondary generalisation and generalised tonic clonic seizures, in both adults and children, with regard to seizure reduction, side effects and tolerance.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-13 12:45:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The study conducted by Allen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>), was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. The treatment/control period lasted nine weeks with an eight-week wash-out period between. The clobazam dosage employed was 30 mg at night for all participants, equivalent to 0.5 mg/kg, presuming a mean participant weight of 60 kg. The other AEDs being taken during the study period were carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone and sodium valproate. The study sample size was limited with only 26 patients of mean age 34 (range 18 to 60).</P>
<P>Keene et al (<LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK>) was also a small double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over study, recruiting 21 patients aged 2 to 19 years (mean 11 years, number over 16 years undisclosed). Thirteen had generalised onset seizures and eight had partial onset seizures. Following an initial one-month baseline period, patients were assigned to a sequence of placebo-clobazam or clobazam-placebo. Treatment periods were of three months with a one-month wash-out period. The initial dosage of clobazam was calculated as 0.5 mg/kg on commencement, increased to 1 mg/kg if no response was achieved. Furthermore, were the participants to develop excessive drowsiness, the dosage was decreased by 0.25 mg/kg/day. Although they do state that baseline serum AED levels were taken and doses adjusted to achieve therapeutic levels, there is no report as to which AEDs were being taken at baseline. The baseline seizure types were 13 participants with generalised and eight with partial onset seizures.</P>
<P>The only multicentre trial identified was conducted by Koeppen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK>) and took place across five European countries. This was also a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study and was reported as being double-blind. This was the largest of the studies identified, recruiting 129 participants, of which 63 were randomised to clobazam then placebo and 66 to placebo then clobazam. There was a one-month baseline period and each 'treatment' period was of three months duration with a one-month wash-out period. Clobazam doses ranged from 10 to 40 mg/day, equating to a dosage range of 0.17 to 0.67 mg/kg, presuming a mean participant weight of 60 kg. The baseline AEDs being taken were, in order of decreasing frequency: carbamazepine; phenobarbital; phenytoin; valproate and primidone. The baseline seizure types were 32 of generalised onset and 149 of partial onset during the preceding year.</P>
<P>The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK>) was also a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. The sample size was limited, involving only 20 patients aged between 18 and 55 years (mean 38 years). The dosage of clobazam used was 10 mg three times a day increasing to a maximum of 40 mg three times a day in 10 mg increments in the first month. The maximum dose was continued for months two and three. Clobazam was then decreased by 5 to 10 mg stages over the 4th monthµ. The placebo was increased and decreased following the same guide, thus creating a gradual wash-out period over one month. This resulted in a mean dose of 0.54 mg/kg (range 0.23 to 0.74 mg/kg). The study concluded with a one-month observation period, during which both clobazam and placebo were removed. The baseline AEDs being taken were, in order of decreasing frequency: phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, phenobarbital, valproic acid, mephenytoin and clonazepam. The baseline seizure types were six of generalised onset and 29 of partial onset. It is not stated if this was during the one-month observation period or another time-frame.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK> was blinded by using identical tablets, however neither the method of allocation concealment nor the method of generating the random sequence was described. There was no description of how the diagnosis was made, although patients were assessed for baseline seizure rates for an undisclosed period and defined as 'refractory', and thus included, if they were having four or more uncontrolled seizures a month. No exclusion criteria were presented. There was no description of adjustment of the dose, however, whilst the mean serum clobazam concentration, taken during the last three weeks of treatment, was 0.33 µmol/l, there is a wide range (0.13 to 0.99 µmol/l), indicating either a wide range of participant-dependent pharmacokinetic variability, variation in compliance or undisclosed dosage alteration. The mean serum concentration of other AEDs was comparable between the two study groups, although there is no description as to which participants on which AEDs were the best responders to clobazam. There is no description of baseline seizure types (Jadad Score 3/5). </P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK> described part of the method used for the concealment of random allocation (the use of a pharmacist) but precise details were not given. No information was given about the generation of the random sequence and the method of blinding was not described (Jadad Score 3/5). The inclusion criteria (requiring morer than four seizures per month) and exclusion criteria (no history of degenerative CNS disorder, brain tumour or poor compliance) were well described. However, the period for which patients were required to have suffered &gt;4 seizures per month and the number of AEDs failing to control seizures were not defined. Furthermore, there is no description of how the diagnosis of epilepsy was made or the medical co-morbidities, although the majority had some degree of mental retardation (17/21). Whilst the dosage adjustment regimen was comprehensively planned, no data were presented as to the proportion of participants who required dosage amendment in this way. There is no description of which baseline AEDs were being taken, or which participants on which AEDs were the best responders to clobazam.</P>
<P>In the multicentre study by <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK> the method for randomisation was reported as being different in each centre and the methods were not disclosed. Furthermore, neither the method of blinding nor the method of allocation concealment was described (Jadad Score 3/5). Doses ranged between 10 and 40 mg/day, with no clear protocol for dosage adjustment or standardisation of starting dose. Epilepsy was diagnosed according to the International League Against Epilepsy guidelines and participants were included if they were having at least three partial seizures a month for an undisclosed period. There was no report of the methods of recruitment, exclusion criteria or medical co-morbidities. There is no description of which patients on which AEDs were the best responders to clobazam. This trial is particularly poorly standardised between the centres with regard to recruitment, exclusion criteria, randomisation and clobazam dosages. </P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK>, whilst reporting that the placebo was matched to clobazam, provide no description of the generation of the random sequence nor the method of allocation concealment. The study did utilise strict inclusion criteria, which were that participants had to have been attending the clinic for at least seven years and to have been diagnosed with focal epilepsy according to the International Classification of Epilepsy. They were defined as refractory if they were still suffering with at least three seizures per month in the year preceding the trial, despite maximally tolerated doses of AED(s). Patients with progressive brain lesions and those with impaired capacity, limiting their ability to comply with treatment and record seizures accurately, were excluded. No medical co-morbidities were reported in the trial (Jadad Score 4/5). </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-04-13 12:45:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial search in March 2007 identified 17 studies, although 12 were initially excluded as investigating monotherapy (3), stiripentol (3), catamenial epilepsy (3), febrile seizures (1), Lennox-Gastaut (1) and one was a pilot study of alternate day versus daily clobazam (1). One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Vadja-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Vadja 1985</LINK>), was excluded, despite being an add-on, randomised controlled trial for refractory epilepsy, as it was a pilot study with only a three-day treatment period, followed by a longer-term cross-over study of only four weeks, with no wash-out period. Only nine participants were randomised (of which four were later transferred to an open trial) and only preliminary results were presented, incorporating open, unrandomised participants. Furthermore, no standard follow-up period or outcome measures were described and for the five participants in the randomised phase, no data were presented to determine seizure frequency or 50% reduction. The full study report was not published.</P>
<P>An updated search in February 2011 identified three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conry 2009</LINK>); these were not applicable for inclusion (reasons given in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>The total number of participants included was 196. A comparison of included studies is reported in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>Whilst all four studies which met our inclusion criteria were double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials, they were all cross-over trials that utilised varying clobazam doses, varying wash-out periods between placebo and clobazam, and differing age groups, baseline AEDs and methodology for assessment of efficacy. Due to such methodological heterogeneity and poor reporting of data collected, it is not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. Therefore, a summary of the included studies, with regard to withdrawal, efficacy, side effects and quality of life data follows.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment withdrawal</B>
<BR/>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK> reported that six participants dropped out of the study, one during treatment with placebo, for undocumented reasons. For the remaining five patients, the timing of and reasons for withdrawal are not provided.<BR/>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK>, two participants had insufficient data to be included in the analysis and 21 patients withdrew from the study, of which three left the hospital and two withdrew for reasons not specified. Of the remaining 16 patients, three withdrew due to side effects from clobazam, one due to side effects on placebo, four due to insufficient efficacy of clobazam and eight due to insufficient efficacy of placebo. The precise treatment period during which treatment withdrawals occurred is not provided, preventing any further analysis of these data.<BR/>
<BR/>The only withdrawal data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK> states that two participants withdrew during the clobazam phase due to "severe behavioural change which did not respond to lowering the drug dosage", however no details of these changes are documented.<BR/>
<BR/>No withdrawal data were presented by <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK>.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>50% or greater seizure reduction</B>
<BR/>Of the participants in the study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>, three (11.5%) were seizure-free and 15 (57.7%) were reported as having had a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency when compared to placebo. Confidence intervals (95%) were not provided and insufficient data were provided in the report to allow the review authors to estimate confidence intervals.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK> reported 50% or greater seizure reduction compared to baseline with 11/21 (52.4%) in the clobazam period compared to none during the placebo period, but no P value or confidence intervals were presented. Insufficient data were provided to allow any further analysis by the review authors.</P>
<P>No data regarding a 50% or greater reduction in seizures were described in <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK>.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK> authors did not report data for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. They did report that eight patients (40%) achieved 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, of which four (20%) were seizure-free. However, these data were collected only during the last month of the three-month treatment period and it was not made clear if comparisons were being made between treatment and pre-treatment periods, or between the clobazam and placebo period.</P>
<P>
<B>Seizure frequency<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK> found that mean seizure frequency was significantly greater in the placebo group for both partial onset seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) and for all seizure types (clobazam versus placebo; 17.5 versus 32.4 (P = 0.02) and 17.0 versus 29.9 (P = 0.002) respectively. No significant difference was found for patients with generalised onset seizures. The data presented for mean seizure frequency failed to include standard deviations or standard errors preventing any further analysis by the review authors. The individual frequency of seizure types is not stated, although the mean number of seizures per participant whilst in the placebo phase demonstrates more partial onset rather than generalised seizures (32.4 versus 24.2 respectively).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK> did not report seizure frequency. Data allowing any further analysis by the review authors were not reported. Whilst there were more participants with generalised rather than partial onset seizures (13 versus eight respectively), on analysis of best responders only those with partial seizures were significant responders (P &lt; 0.05).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Whilst the mean number of seizures for each group was presented by <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK> in graphical form, no numerical data were reported. Seizure reduction was reported as being near to the level of significance (P = 0.06), however, no other data were presented to support this and it is not clear whether this refers to a comparison to baseline seizure frequency or a comparison between the clobazam and placebo periods. Furthermore, there is no documentation as to the relative frequency of seizure types.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK> authors report that the reduction in the mean number of seizures in the four months during which patients were on the full dose clobazam or placebo as significant (10.4 versus 21.5 respectively, P &lt; 0.001). An analysis of seizure subgroups found that mean partial onset seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) were significantly reduced (clobazam versus placebo 10.4 versus 20.3, P &lt; 0.01), but results for the generalised onset seizures group were not significant. During the whole study period, the number of participants suffering partial onset seizures was greater than the number suffering generalised onset seizures (20 versus five respectively).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
<BR/>Limited adverse effects data were presented by <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Keene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Keene 1990</LINK>, the former reporting no specific adverse events quantitatively. Although six patients required dose reduction during the clobazam phase and two during the placebo phase, it is not made clear whether these patients were in addition to the six who formally withdrew from the study. Keene et al only described the withdrawal of two patients during the clobazam phase due to "severe behavioural change which did not respond to a lowering of the dose", but no data were presented regarding side effect nature or frequency.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK>, report that 36% (38/106) suffered side effects whilst on clobazam and 12% (13/106) on placebo, of which drowsiness (71% clobazam and 16% placebo) and dizziness (26% clobazam and 6% placebo) were the side effects most commonly reported. However, only three participants withdrew from the study due to side effects whilst on clobazam.</P>
<P>A large proportion of side effects was found by <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1986</LINK> in that 85% complained of symptoms, mainly drowsiness, vertigo, depression or diplopia. However, 12 patients (60%) reported side effects during the placebo period. It was not reported as to whether those suffering side effects withdrew from the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life</B>
<BR/>Only the study conducted by Koeppen et al described quality of life data. Data were assessed using the CGI scale, reporting that 60% (64/106) of participants had achieved a therapeutic effect whilst on clobazam compared to 11% (12/106) on placebo. Furthermore, utilising three analogue scales they report a significant improvement in mood state whilst in the clobazam phase (P &lt; 0.05), although there was also a significant increase in drowsiness (P &lt; 0.05). However, there is no explanation of the methods used to collect and analyse these data.</P>
<P>
<B>EEG assessment</B>
<BR/>Whilst <LINK REF="STD-Koeppen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Koeppen 1987</LINK> intended to assess EEG data, all that was reported is improvement in paroxsymal activity in the temporal lobes, with clobazam with no quantitative data or significance levels documented.</P>
<P>None of the other studies assessed EEG response.</P>
<P>
<B>Tolerance</B>
<BR/>The only study to attempt an assessment of tolerance was that conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>, who, whilst reporting no evidence of tolerance, only attempted to assess this by comparison between the first and last four weeks of the treatment period using a method that was not described.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Four studies representing 196 recruited participants met the inclusion criteria for this review, all of which were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trials with two treatment periods. The reporting of important methodological factors such as the method of randomisation and blinding was poor. Due to differences in the study methodology, choice of outcomes and inadequate reporting of outcome data it was not possible to summarise data in a meta-analysis and data from studies were summarised narratively in this review.</P>
<P>The majority of patients recruited into three of the four studies had partial onset seizures and between them the included studies tested a range of clobazam doses as summarised in the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' table. Current data suggest that for patients with drug refractory epilepsy, when used as an add-on treatment, clobazam may reduce the frequency of seizures although it is not possible to quantify precisely the treatment effect. Adverse effects rates were higher during clobazam treatment periods, particularly drowsiness and dizziness, but current data do not precisely define the adverse effects profile of clobazam, nor the precise risk of individual adverse effects. In addition, the impact of clobazam on quality of life has not been adequately assessed.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>For patients with drug refractory epilepsy, clobazam when used as an add-on treatment may reduce seizure frequency. There are more data to support this for patients with partial onset seizures than for patients with generalised onset seizures. The quality of existing data is poor and it is not possible to define the size of treatment effect. The adverse effects most commonly reported were drowsiness and dizziness, but current data do not adequately define the adverse effect profile of clobazam. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In order to better inform clinical practice we need a large-scale, multicentre, parallel group randomised controlled trial comparing clobazam with other add-on treatments for patients with drug refractory epilepsy. This trial should recruit a heterogeneous population with well defined seizure and epilepsy types to allow the identification of patient factors, pathology, seizure types and baseline AEDs associated with the greatest benefit or harm. In addition, research is increasingly being undertaken into epilepsy genetics, with regard to the factors contributing to 'refractory' epilepsy and identifying in whom which AEDs will achieve greatest efficacy. Such investigation should be included in future research into clobazam. Furthermore, because it has been off-patent for over 20 years, clobazam is cheaper than the newer AEDs available for use as add-on treatments for refractory epilepsy. However none of the studies included in this review assessed cost-effectiveness, evaluation of which would need to be undertaken in any future research to inform clinical practice.</P>

<P>Pilot study with only a 3-day treatment period, followed by a longer-term study of 4 weeks, with no wash-out period. Only 9 participants randomised (of which 4 were later transferred to the open trial) and only preliminary results presented, incorporating open, unrandomised participants. No standard follow-up period or outcome measures. For the 5 in the randomised phase, no data presented to determine seizure frequency or 50% reduction. Full study report not published.</P>
