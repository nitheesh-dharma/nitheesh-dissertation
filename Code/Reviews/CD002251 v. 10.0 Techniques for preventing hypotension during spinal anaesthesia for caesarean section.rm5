<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-03 10:10:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Spinal anaesthesia is a commonly used technique for caesarean birth as the mother is able to be awake for the birth and usually remains comfortable afterwards. In addition, the technique avoids the risks of general anaesthesia. The most common adverse effect of spinal anaesthesia is a fall in blood pressure (hypotension).</P>
<P>This study reviews the evidence for preventing hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean birth.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean birth occurs frequently. When it occurs, the mother may feel faint or nauseous and may vomit. If her blood pressure falls excessively, the mother runs serious risks (such as loss of consciousness), as does the baby (such as lack of oxygen and brain damage). Hypotension may be prevented by administering intravenous fluids, giving medications (such as ephedrine, phenylephrine, and ondansetron), by leg compression, or by the mother either lying down or walking around before the spinal anaesthesia.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the evidence in August 2016 and found a total of 126 studies involving 9565 women. Included studies investigated 49 different comparisons, which we split into three groups: intravenous fluid therapy, medications, and physical methods. Here we describe the results of the six main comparisons (crystalloid versus control; colloid versus crystalloid; ephedrine versus phenylephrine; ondansetron versus control; leg compression versus control; walking versus lying).</P>
<P>
<I>Fluid therapy (crystalloid versus control; colloid versus crystalloid)</I>
</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether crystalloids prevent hypotension because the quality of the evidence is very low. Giving colloids instead of crystalloids may mean that fewer women have low blood pressure after having spinal anaesthesia.</P>
<P>We cannot be certain due to the very low quality evidence whether crystalloid or colloid are better at preventing maternal low heart rate (bradycardia), high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, neonatal acidosis, or low Apgar scores. Whether women received crystalloids or no fluids did not affect the number of women who experienced nausea and/or vomiting.</P>
<P>
<I>Medications (ephedrine versus phenylephrine; ondansetron versus control)</I>
</P>
<P>Lower rates of bradycardia occurred in women receiving ephedrine versus phenylephrine, and with ondansetron versus no ondansetron, but the evidence is low quality. Ondansetron may prevent low blood pressure and nausea/vomiting but made little or no difference to neonatal acidosis or Apgar scores. There was little difference between ephedrine and phenylephrine for low or high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, neonatal acidosis, or Apgar scores. We cannot be certain of these results due to the low or very low quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>
<I>Physical methods (leg compression versus control; walking versus lying)</I>
</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether leg compression reduces the number of women with hypotension compared with no leg compression because the quality of evidence is very low. Similarly, we cannot be certain whether leg compression made any difference to women experiencing bradycardia or nausea and vomiting, or to babies' Apgar scores. It is also uncertain whether walking or lying down before the spinal anaesthesia reduces low blood pressure.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>We found that no single method completely prevents hypotension in women receiving spinal anaesthesia during caesarean birth. Administering intravenous fluids or certain medications, and compressing the legs with bandages, stockings, or inflatable devices may reduce the incidence of hypotension. However, we found the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, so there is still a need for large, high-quality studies using these clinically relevant interventions, either alone or in combination.</P>
<P>Future research in this setting could focus on combinations of these effective strategies or on new innovative strategies.</P>

<P>We included 126 studies involving 9565 participants. Interventions were to prevent maternal hypotension following spinal anaesthesia only, and we excluded any interventions considered active treatment. All the included studies reported the review's primary outcome. Across 49 comparisons, we identified three intervention groups: intravenous fluids, pharmacological interventions, and physical interventions. Authors reported no serious adverse effects with any of the interventions investigated. Most trials reported hypotension requiring intervention and Apgar score of less than 8 at five minutes as the only outcomes. None of the trials included in the comparisons we describe reported admission to neonatal intensive care unit.</P>
<P>
<B>Crystalloid versus control (no fluids)</B>
</P>
<P>Fewer women experienced hypotension in the crystalloid group compared with no fluids (average risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.98; 370 women; 5 studies; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no clear difference between groups in numbers of women with nausea and vomiting (average RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.91; 1 study; 69 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). No baby had an Apgar score of less than 8 at five minutes in either group (60 babies, <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Colloid versus crystalloid</B>
</P>
<P>Fewer women experienced hypotension in the colloid group compared with the crystalloid group (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80; 2105 women; 28 studies; <I>very</I> <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There were no clear differences between groups for maternal hypertension requiring intervention (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.46, 3 studies, 327 women;<I> very low-quality evidence</I>), maternal bradycardia requiring intervention (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.79, 6 studies, 509 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), nausea and/or vomiting (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13, 15 studies, 1154 women, I² = 37%; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), neonatal acidosis (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.15 to 4.52, 6 studies, 678 babies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), or Apgar score of less than 8 at five minutes (average RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.05, 11 studies, 826 babies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Ephedrine versus phenylephrine</B>
</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between ephedrine and phenylephrine groups for preventing maternal hypotension (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.18; 401 women; 8 studies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) or hypertension (average RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, 2 studies, 118 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Rates of bradycardia were lower in the ephedrine group (average RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.64, 5 studies, 304 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no clear difference in the number of women with nausea and/or vomiting (average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.49, 4 studies, 204 women, I² = 37%, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), or babies with neonatal acidosis (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.07 to 12.00, 3 studies, 175 babies, <I>low-quality evidence</I>).

<P>
<B>Ondansetron versus control</B>
</P>
<P>Ondansetron administration was more effective than control (placebo saline) for preventing hypotension requiring treatment (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 740 women, 8 studies, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), bradycardia requiring treatment (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87; 740 women, 8 studies, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), and nausea and/or vomiting (average RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.51; 653 women, 7 studies, <I>low-quality evidence</I>).

<P>
<B>Lower limb compression versus control</B>
</P>
<P>Lower limb compression was more effective than control for preventing hypotension (average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78, 11 studies, 705 women, I² = 65%, <I>very low-quality evidence). </I>There was no clear difference between the groups in rates of bradycardia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.56, 1 study, 74 women, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) or nausea and/or vomiting (average RR 0.42 , 95% CI 0.14 to 1.27, 4 studies, 276 women, I² = 32%, <I>very-low quality evidence</I>). No baby had an Apgar score of less than 8 at five minutes in either group (130 babies, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Walking versus lying</B>
</P>
<P>There was no clear difference between the groups for women with hypotension requiring treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.21, 1 study, 37 women, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Many included studies reported little to no information that would allow an assessment of their risk of bias, limiting our ability to draw meaningful conclusions. GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. We downgraded evidence for limitations in study design, imprecision, and indirectness; most studies assessed only women scheduled for elective caesarean sections.</P>
<P>External validity also needs consideration. Readers should question the use of colloids in this context given the serious potential side effects such as allergy and renal failure associated with their administration.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 09:42:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While interventions such as crystalloids, colloids, ephedrine, phenylephrine, ondansetron, or lower leg compression can reduce the incidence of hypotension, none have been shown to eliminate the need to treat maternal hypotension in some women. We cannot draw any conclusions regarding rare adverse effects associated with use of the interventions (for example colloids) due to the relatively small numbers of women studied.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-02 12:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The choice of anaesthesia for caesarean birth is made by balancing women's preferences with the risks and benefits of a particular technique to the mother and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaesthesia-related maternal mortality occurs most frequently when using general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1994</LINK>). Other risks of general anaesthesia include: failed endotracheal intubation, failed ventilation, aspiration pneumonitis, dental trauma, postoperative nausea and vomiting, delayed breastfeeding, and sedation of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Atlee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atlee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisner 1999</LINK>). Regional techniques such as epidural or spinal anaesthesia avoid these risks, allow the mother to be awake at the baby's birth, and may reduce the need for systemic opioid administration postoperatively. Epidural analgesia during labour can be extended to provide surgical anaesthesia should caesarean section be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1999</LINK>). However, a spinal anaesthetic technique has the advantage of simplicity, rapid onset, low failure rate, minimal drug dose, and excellent muscle relaxation during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>). This frequently makes it the anaesthetic technique of choice for both elective and emergency caesarean delivery when a functioning epidural catheter is not in place. Indeed, at least 40% of women having caesarean sections in the USA receive spinal anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997</LINK>), as do most women undergoing elective caesarean operations in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Husaini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Husaini 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shibli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibli 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spinal anaesthesia to the level of T4 is necessary to provide an adequate block for caesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ousley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ousley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1995</LINK>). As a consequence, an almost inevitable complete sympathetic block occurs, and decreased venous return to the heart &#8211; exacerbated by a degree of inferior vena caval compression &#8211; results in hypotension and decreased cardiac output (<LINK REF="REF-Rocke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocke 1995</LINK>). Hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery occurs in as many as 70% to 80% of women receiving pharmacological prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Mercier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercier 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite all regional techniques being associated with maternal hypotension, the slower onset and lower incidence of this complication during epidural anaesthesia may make the need for prophylactic medications such as ephedrine unnecessary (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1995</LINK>). In contrast, the frequent occurrence and rapid onset of hypotension during spinal anaesthesia has encouraged anaesthetists to try and prevent or minimise the associated maternal symptoms of vomiting, nausea, and impaired consciousness during the establishment of the block. The concomitant reduction in the utero-placental blood supply associated with maternal hypotension has deleterious effects such as fetal acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1992</LINK>), which may result in weak rooting and sucking reflexes of infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hollmen-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollmen 1978</LINK>); these can severely compromise the establishment of breastfeeding postdelivery (<LINK REF="REF-May-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preventing spinal hypotension appears more likely to decrease the frequency and severity of associated adverse maternal symptoms than treating established hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-Datta-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Datta 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Husaini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Husaini 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 1982</LINK>). Surprisingly few pre-eclamptic women having caesarean birth under spinal anaesthesia require intervention for hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharwood_x002d_Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharwood-Smith 1999</LINK>), so routine prophylaxis is probably unnecessary in this particular patient group. Women in established labour who subsequently undergo spinal anaesthesia seem similarly unaffected by hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Lapins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapins 2001</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-19 10:47:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Maternal hypotension is the most frequent complication of spinal anaesthesia, with an incidence approaching 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1995</LINK>). Untreated severe hypotension can pose serious risks to both mother (unconsciousness, pulmonary aspiration, apnoea, or even cardiac arrest) and baby (impaired placental perfusion leading to hypoxia, fetal acidosis, and neurological injury). Although there is some variation, most workers define hypotension as a maternal systolic blood pressure below 70% to 80% of baseline recordings, an absolute value of less than 90 mmHg to 100 mmHg, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-02 12:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians currently use a range of strategies including intravenous fluids, pharmacological treatments, and physical interventions to minimise or prevent hypotension. These strategies may include proper maternal position with the uterus displaced off the vena cava, infusion of fluids to increase effective blood volume, and the administration of ephedrine to vasoconstrict the peripheral circulation and increase heart rate (<LINK REF="REF-Glosten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glosten 2000</LINK>). Other workers have administered the alpha agonists phenylephrine or metaraminol, which act primarily by vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="STD-Alahuhta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Alahuhta 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1994</LINK>). Physical interventions such as leg wrappings are also used and may act by minimising venous pooling of blood in the legs (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Bogaert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Van Bogaert 1998</LINK>). All these methods aim to maintain blood pressure by increasing venous return to the heart, increasing the resistance of the peripheral circulation, or both. There is, however, no established ideal technique.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-19 10:50:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Health professionals can administer intravenous fluids, including crystalloids and colloids, to increase maternal blood volume, resulting in an increase in venous return, stroke volume, and blood pressure. Intravenous fluid administration prior to spinal anaesthesia for caesarean birth is accepted standard practice (<LINK REF="STD-Rout-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Rout 1993b</LINK>). The choice of fluid depends on individual and institutional habit, material cost (crystalloid is considerably cheaper), and the perceived relative benefits and risks. Uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects of colloids include anaphylactoid reactions (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 1995</LINK>), impaired coagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1999</LINK>), and the risk of infection such as hepatitis C from human albumin preparations. In addition, some authors have raised concerns regarding prior transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy from bovine-derived pharmaceuticals such as the gelatin Haemaccel (<LINK REF="REF-Wickham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickham 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vasopressors, such as the alpha-agonist phenylephrine, cause peripheral vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This subsequently results in an increase in blood pressure. Combined alpha and beta-agonists, such as ephedrine, may also prevent hypotension by increasing both heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Furthermore, anti-muscarinic agents, such as glycopyrrolate, may be useful to increase heart rate, resulting in a subsequent increase in blood pressure. Possible adverse effects of vasopressors include anaphylaxis, hypertension, and cardiac dysrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, there is the potential for impaired utero-placental perfusion secondary to vasoconstriction (despite maintenance or restoration of maternal blood pressure) with fetal or neonatal consequences as described above.</P>
<P>Physical interventions, such as leg wrapping and calf compression devices, may be helpful in improving venous return and therefore can improve blood pressure. However, these techniques may also have unintentional effects such as localised ischaemia, nerve injury, or unacceptable maternal discomfort.</P>

<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> and in relation to the following outcomes for the main comparisons. We chose six key comparisons for a specific focus, as they represent the most clinically relevant comparisons in this updated review.</P>

<LI>Admission to neonatal intensive care unit</LI>
</OL>
<P>We also prepared a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcome (women with hypotension requiring intervention) for all of the six key comparisons for illustrative purposes.</P>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> in order to create 'Summary of findings' tables, creating a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. We downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

We assessed this study as being at high risk of other bias. Some evidence of asymmetry is apparent in two of the three funnel plots (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), which suggests possible publication bias due to the number of small studies.</P>
<P>There were 2 studies assessed as high risk as study participants received variable doses of local anaesthetic in their spinal block (<LINK REF="STD-Alahuhta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Alahuhta 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathru-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mathru 1980</LINK>). Also, there were 2 studies assessed as high risk of bias as it was unclear whether the spinal anaesthetic technique and dose was standardised between the study groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ozkan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ozkan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1998</LINK>).

Substantial heterogeneity (I² = 85%, Tau² = 0.16) was likely due to differences in formulation and volume of fluid administered between studies. However, due to the variation in regimens between studies, it was not possible to conduct formal subgroup analyses. There was some evidence of asymmetry on funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), which could be due to the large number of small studies contributing to this analysis.</P>

Substantial heterogeneity was present (I² = 75%, Tau² = 0.14), which was most likely due to differences in dosing of prophylactic ephedrine, rescue treatments for hypotension when it occurred, and administration routes for the ephedrine.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-02 12:06:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although some interventions assessed in this review (such as colloids, ephedrine, or lower leg compression) can reduce the incidence of hypotension, we found none that eliminate the need to treat maternal hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. It is likely that one or more interventions used together, as commonly occurs in clinical practice, is most effective.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Crystalloids alone may be inadequate for preventing hypotension.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Lower leg compression is more effective than control for preventing hypotension.</LI>

<LI>We did not find other physical methods such as position, wedging, or leg elevation to be effective, but these trials were often small and may benefit from further research.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Mortality and serious morbidity in this population are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1996</LINK>). The reviewed trials report no serious adverse events such as anaphylaxis, cerebral haemorrhage, or maternal death. We did not see any differences in the incidence of fetal acidosis when comparing ephedrine with phenylephrine for preventing hypotension during spinal anaesthesia, although <LINK REF="REF-Ngan-Kee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngan Kee 2006</LINK> has suggested an increased risk when using ephedrine to treat, rather than prevent, hypotension.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-19 15:56:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is very likely to represent the key research findings to date and to be applicable to clinical practice. We suggest some caution about the magnitude of the findings of some intervention comparisons given that many of these comparisons are only supported by either a single study or several small studies of unclear quality. Despite our finding that colloids were more effective than crystalloids for reducing maternal hypotension after spinal anaesthesia, the included trials were too small to show the well-recognised and serious potential risks that colloid administration represents.</P>
<P>The findings of this review will be less relevant for women with pre-eclampsia, who appear less likely to require prophylactic measures or emergency procedures than normotensive women (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>). Most studies in this review excluded women with pre-existing hypertension.</P>
<P>One of the main limitations of a review of this type is outcome definition. There were multiple different definitions of hypotension between studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In this review, we used the definition of hypotension provided by study authors to pool these data in our meta-analyses.</P>
<P>All studies investigated women having elective caesarean births except for one study that included women undergoing emergency caesarean sections.</P>
<P>As can be seen from the Results section and from the meta-analyses, we found a large number of small studies with little to no information for enabling an adequate 'Risk of bias' assessment. Many studies did not report details about their method of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, which limits our ability to draw clear conclusions. Furthermore, several pooled results showed high levels of heterogeneity between studies, which is most likely due to differences in study design interventions, anaesthetic techniques and variations in definition of hypotension.</P>
<P>We note that there are several studies awaiting assessment and acknowledge that there will be a lag time in assessing and incorporating these studies in future reviews. However, it appears unlikely that these studies will impact our key findings.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-19 15:56:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The GRADE assessments for the key outcomes (incidence of maternal hypotension/hypertension requiring intervention; incidence of maternal bradycardia; incidence of maternal nausea and/or vomiting; neonatal acidosis as defined by cord or neonatal bloods with a pH of less than 7.2; neonatal Apgar score of less than 8 at five minutes; admission to neonatal intensive care unit) showed either low or very low quality. We chose six key comparisons for GRADE quality assessments because they represent the most clinically relevant comparisons in the updated review (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>). Many studies were small, and their lack of detail in reporting led us to assess them as being at unclear risk of bias in method of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. Seventeen studies had one or more factors designated as causing high risk of bias, but sensitivity analyses removing 12 studies where possible did not change the findings (<LINK REF="STD-Bhagwanjee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bhagwanjee 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bottiger-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bottiger 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardoso-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Cardoso 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carvalho-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carvalho 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahlgren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlgren 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magalhaes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Magalhaes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercier-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mercier 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muzlifah-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Muzlifah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romdhani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Romdhani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ueyama-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ueyama 1999)</LINK>. The remaining five studies were single studies for which sensitivity analyses were not possible (<LINK REF="STD-Calvache-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Calvache 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cyna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cyna 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eldaba-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Eldaba 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulhas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gulhas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pouliou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pouliou 2006</LINK>). As well as for study design, we downgraded evidence for indirectness (because most studies included only women having elective caesarean sections), inconsistency, and imprecision.</P>
<P>We noted significant heterogeneity for some comparisons, namely crystalloid versus colloid, colloid of different volumes, ephedrine versus control, ephedrine versus crystalloid, ephedrine versus phenylephrine. Sensitivity analysis showed minimal changes in overall findings.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-02 12:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several potential sources of bias in this review process.</P>
<P>Firstly, there were several differences between previous published versions and this version, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>specific exclusion of quasi-randomised, cluster, and cross-over trials; and</LI>
<LI>specific exclusion of studies investigating prevention of hypotension with combined spinal-epidural techniques.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Given the large number of randomised controlled trials investigating the core review objective (assessing the effects of prophylactic interventions for hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section), the authors agreed that incorporating these trials into this review would contribute to a lower quality and less robust review.</P>
<P>Secondly, one of the review authors (AMC) was the lead author on an included study (<LINK REF="STD-Cyna-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cyna 2010</LINK>). We minimised this potential source of bias by ensuring that review authors independent of this study (RSL and CC) performed the data extraction.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there were 2 studies assessed as high risk as study participants received variable doses of local anaesthetic in their spinal block (<LINK REF="STD-Alahuhta-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Alahuhta 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathru-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mathru 1980</LINK>). Also, there were 2 studies assessed as high risk of bias as it was unclear whether the spinal anaesthetic technique and dose was standardised between the study groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ozkan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ozkan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1998</LINK>). It was unlikely that with randomisation this source of bias would have an important effect on the review findings.</P>
<P>Finally, for the purposes of this review, we specifically excluded the use of infusion pumps programmed with algorithms to address hypotension. It was difficult to determine whether this approach constituted prevention or treatment of hypotension, but discussion among review authors produced a consensus that it was the latter. Future reviews may consider whether it may be appropriate to include the results of these other computer-controlled techniques.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-02 12:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results are consistent with one meta-analysis that found that prophylactic ondansetron reduces the incidence of spinal induced hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Gao-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gao 2015</LINK>). This meta-analysis also suggested that given the large heterogeneity and small sample sizes, there should be further large and high-quality randomised trials investigating the efficacy of ondansetron for preventing hypotension in this setting.</P>
<P>Our results are also consistent with a systematic review that found limited evidence to support or clearly disprove the value of maternal positioning, including the use of table tilting and wedges (<LINK REF="REF-Cluver-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluver 2013</LINK>). They also found that manual displacement of the uterus may be better than a left lateral tilt, but larger studies need to confirm this &#8211; a conclusion consistent with our results.</P>
<P>Finally, a recent review determined the effects of colloids and crystalloids in the incidence of hypotension induced by spinal anaesthesia in elective caesarean section and also showed that colloid administration reduced the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anaesthesia in elective caesarean section compared with crystalloid use (<LINK REF="REF-Rippoles-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rippoles 2015</LINK>). However, these authors make no mention of the serious potential risks that colloid administration may represent or the additional costs involved. Indeed, a recent Cochrane Review found no evidence that resuscitation with colloids reduces the risk of death compared to resuscitation with crystalloids in patients with trauma, burns, or following surgery. The review authors suggest that as colloids were no more effective for preventing mortality than crystalloid and were considerably more expensive, it is hard to see any justification for their continued use in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Perel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perel 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review will be mostly applicable to obstetric anaesthesia where women are having planned caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. No single or combined prophylactic intervention avoids the need to treat some women for hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. Colloid or crystalloid preloading or coloading, the administration of parenteral ephedrine, phenylephrine, metaraminol, and ondansetron, and lower limb compression (by bandages, stockings or inflatable boots) reduce but do not eliminate the incidence of spinal hypotension requiring intervention in this setting. Despite colloids being more effective than crystalloids for reducing the incidence of maternal hypotension, the well-recognised serious potential risks and additional costs that colloid administration may represent also need consideration. It is not possible to draw conclusions with respect to the optimum volume of intravenous fluid, route or timing of administration of vasopressors, or method of lower limb compression. Ephedrine may produce a dose-related increase in blood pressure and heart rate. We cannot draw any other conclusions regarding adverse effects of the studied interventions, probably due to their low incidence, the small number of women studied, and the incompleteness of data for these outcomes. It is likely that combinations of interventions will be more effective than individual ones.</P>

<P>Future studies in this area could: include clearer reporting of methodological aspects, such as allocation, to confirm internal validity; have larger sample sizes (i.e. at least 100 participants); and include an assessment of maternal acceptability of the various prophylactic interventions under investigation. Future research could avoid interventions that fail to use standard, externally valid comparisons. Most importantly, future studies need to report the incidence of hypotension requiring an intervention. For comparisons where there are many existing studies, any further studies need to be higher quality and involve larger sample sizes.</P>
<P>It would also be important to obtain further information on the potential serious but rare side effects of colloid administration in this setting, from large-scale epidemiological studies or registries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Suggested systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>Our initial search identified several trials comparing different anaesthetic techniques or drugs, which may have an impact on haemodynamics, for example the possible local anaesthetic-sparing effect of spinal opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, or the shorter-acting sufentanil. It may also be that the incidence of hypotension can be predictably affected by the technique itself rather than (or in addition to) the prophylactic measures we have examined.</P>

<P>Woman, anaesthetist performing the spinal block, collecting the data and treating adverse effects, and the paediatrician assessing neonatal outcomes were all unaware of group allocation.

To maintain blinding, this occurred after completion of colloid administration in the preload group (lasting ~15-20 min) or 15-20 min from starting the Ringer's lactate in the coload group.</P>
