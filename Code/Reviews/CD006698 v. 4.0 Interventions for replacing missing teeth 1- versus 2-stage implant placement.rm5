<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-04-16 09:19:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants can be successful either if placed through the oral mucosa, sticking through the gums (1-stage procedure) or if completely buried under the soft tissues (2-stage procedure) to heal load-free for a few months. However, one additional minor surgical intervention is needed, if a 2-stage procedure is used, to allow the connection of the buried implants with the transgingival component which will hold the prosthesis in place.<BR/>The review found some evidence from five studies with 239 patients that 1- or 2-stage implant placement may have similar outcomes, though in patients with no teeth trends suggested more implant failures for those implants sticking through the gum. More research is needed to answer this question in a definitive way, but it appears possible to place dental implants following a 1-stage procedure (i.e. the implants are sticking through the gums during the bone healing period). The advantages of the 1-stage procedure are: (1) one minor surgical intervention can be avoided, and (2) the treatment time can be shortened, since it is not needed to wait for the healing/stabilization of the soft tissues after the second surgical intervention. Nevertheless there are situations when a 2-stage procedure could be preferable, for instance when a not optimal implant stability is achieved at implant placement or when there is the risk that the provisional denture transmits excessive forces to the portion of the implants sticking through the gums.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Implants may be placed penetrating the oral mucosa (1-stage procedure) or can be completely buried under the oral mucosa (2-stage procedure) during the healing phase of the bone at the implant surface. With a 2-stage procedure the risk of having unwanted loading onto the implants is minimized, but a second minor surgical intervention is needed to connect the healing abutments and more time is needed prior to start the prosthetic phase because of the wound-healing period required in relation to the second surgical intervention.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate whether a 1-stage implant placement procedure is as effective as a 2-stage procedure. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-04-16 10:41:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Handsearching included several dental journals. Authors of all identified trials, an Internet discussion group and 55 dental implant manufacturers were contacted to find unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The last electronic search was conducted on 21 January 2009.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-11 11:13:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All RCTs of osseointegrated dental implants comparing the same dental implants placed according to 1- versus 2-stage procedures with a minimum follow up of 6 months after loading. Outcome measures were: prosthesis failures, implant failures, marginal bone level changes on intraoral radiographs, patient preference including aesthetics, aesthetics evaluated by dentists, and complications.</P>

<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-02 07:35:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five RCTs were identified and included reporting data on 239 patients in total. On a patient, rather than per implant basis, the meta-analyses showed no statistically significant differences for prosthesis and implant failures, though trends, especially in fully edentulous patients, favoured 2-stage (submerged) implants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-11 11:26:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of patients included in the trials was too small to draw definitive conclusions. The 1-stage approach might be preferable in partially edentulous patients since it avoids one surgical intervention and shortens treatment times, while a 2-stage submerged approach could be indicated when an implant has not obtained an optimal primary stability or when barriers are used for guided tissue regeneration, or when it is expected that removable temporary prostheses could transmit excessive forces on the penetrating abutments especially in fully edentulous patients.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-17 09:47:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-04-16 09:20:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges to restore the ability of patients to eat and speak and to improve appearance. However, in several instances, patients are not satisfied with the function of removable dentures and it is not always possible to place a fixed bridge if the number of remaining abutment teeth is insufficient. Since the 1970s, osseointegrated dental implants have offered an alternative (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). They are surgically inserted into the jaw bones to support a dental prosthesis and are retained because of the intimacy of bone growth onto their surface (osseointegration). Dental implants have undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 30 years.</P>
<P>Traditionally to minimize implant failures, osseointegrated dental implants were inserted following a 2-stage protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). Implants were completely submerged under the soft tissues and left to heal for a period of 3 to 4 months in mandibles (lower jaws) and 6 to 8 months in maxillae (upper jaws). In fact, primary implant stability and lack of micromovements are considered to be two of the main factors necessary to achieve predictable high success of osseointegrated dental implants (<LINK REF="REF-Albrektsson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albrektsson 1981</LINK>). A successful osseointegrated dental implant is anchored directly to bone, however, in the presence of movements during healing, the implant may be encapsulated by soft tissues instead (<LINK REF="REF-Brunski-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunski 1979</LINK>), similarly to what happens with non-union bone fractures, causing the failure of the implant. To minimize the risk of soft tissue encapsulation, it has been recommended to keep the implants submerged and load-free during the healing period. With a 2-stage approach the risk of transmitting unwanted loading forces to the healing bone at the implant interface was minimized. However, a second surgical intervention (usually a minor one) is needed to connect the implants to the abutments holding the future prosthesis. In addition, after the second intervention, some weeks of healing are needed for the soft tissues to stabilize around the penetrating abutment to allow a predictable aesthetic outcome.</P>
<P>Other authors developed dental implants to be used with a 1-stage procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Buser-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buser 1988</LINK>). With this approach flaps are sutured around the polished neck of the implants avoiding the need for a second surgical intervention. Longitudinal follow-up studies suggested that high early success rates could also be achieved using a 1-stage approach (<LINK REF="REF-Buser-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buser 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buser 1997</LINK>). Subsequent controlled clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ericsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ericsson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collaert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collaert 1998</LINK>) comparing implants placed according to a 1- versus 2-stage procedure, also suggested that implants placed with a 1-stage approach may achieve a high degree of success. It would be therefore useful to know whether there is any clinical significant difference among implants placed according to 1-stage (non-submerged) versus 2-stage (submerged) procedures.</P>
</BACKGROUND>

<P>To test the null hypothesis of no difference between 1- versus 2-stage procedures, against the alternative hypothesis of a difference.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently by two review authors to establish whether the studies did meet the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent validity assessment and data extraction. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, and reasons for exclusion recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as required before use. Any disagreement was discussed and a third review author consulted where necessary. All authors were contacted for clarification or missing information. Data were excluded until further clarification was available or if agreement could not be reached.</P>
<P>For each trial the following data were recorded.<BR/>-Year of publication, country of origin and source of study funding.<BR/>-Details of the participants including demographic characteristics and criteria for inclusion.<BR/>-Details of the type of intervention.<BR/>-Details of the outcomes reported, including method of assessment, and time intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The quality assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process.</P>
<P>Three main quality criteria were examined.<BR/>(1) Allocation concealment, recorded as:<BR/>(A) Adequate<BR/>(B) Unclear<BR/>(C) Inadequate.<BR/>Allocation concealment was considered adequate if it was centralised (e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics); pharmacy-controlled randomisation; pre-numbered or coded identical containers which were administered serially to participants; on-site computer system combined with allocation kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled patient have been entered; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; and other approaches similar to those listed above, along with the reassurance that the person who generated the allocation scheme did not administer it. Some schemes may be innovative and not fit any of the approaches above, but still provide adequate concealment. Approaches to allocation concealment which were considered clearly inadequate included any procedure that was entirely transparent before allocation, such as an open list of random numbers. Ideally the surgeon should have known the group allocation just before the treatment was delivered. Those articles or authors stating that allocation concealment procedures were implemented but did not provide details on how this was accomplished, were coded as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>(2) Treatment blind to outcomes assessors, recorded as:<BR/>(A) Yes<BR/>(B) No<BR/>(C) Unclear<BR/>(D) Not possible.</P>
<P>(3) Completeness of follow up (is there a clear explanation for withdrawals and drop outs in each treatment group?) assessed as.<BR/>(A) No drop outs/yes. In the case that clear explanations for drop outs were given, a further subjective evaluation of the risk of bias assessing the reasons for the drop out was made.<BR/>(B) No.</P>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories.<BR/>(A) Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met.<BR/>(B) High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met.</P>
<P>Further quality assessment was carried out to assess sample size calculations, definition of exclusion/inclusion criteria, and comparability of control and test groups at entry. The quality assessment criteria were pilot tested using several articles.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effect of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarize the data for each group. The statistical unit was the patient and not the implant.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses were done only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using a random-effects model. Data from split-mouth studies were to be combined with data from parallel group trials with the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager (RevMan). The techniques described by Follmann (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) were to be used to estimate the standard error of the difference for split-mouth studies, where the appropriate data were not presented and could not be obtained.</P>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Clinical heterogeneity was to be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the study quality assessment on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined, but there were insufficient trials to undertake this.</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were planned, however there were insufficient studies in the meta-analysis to undertake this.<BR/>(1) Whether turned (machined) or implants with a roughened surface were used.<BR/>(2) Whether implants were placed in partially or fully edentulous jaws.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cecchinato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cecchinato 2004</LINK>) was originally presented as a mixture of a parallel and split-mouth design trial and had to be excluded in the previous version of this review. Each future prosthesis (also within the same patient) was randomised to 1- or 2-stage implant placement. We requested the authors to provide only the data of the first prosthesis for each patient so the trial become of parallel group design. Since the authors kindly provided all the requested information we were able to include their trial in this review. This explains why the data presented in this review differ from the originally published data.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-04-16 10:17:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials were included in the present review, however only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heijdenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heijdenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cecchinato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cecchinato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>) could be used to evaluate failures of the prostheses (because no prosthesis failed in the remaining two trials). Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heijdenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heijdenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cecchinato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cecchinato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becktor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Becktor 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>) could be included in a meta-analysis evaluating implant failures. In addition, all but one of the included trials were considered at high risk of bias, therefore the evidence is not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Taken the results of all trials in consideration, it might be inferred with caution that no major clinical differences exist among the two procedures, though these preliminary findings need to be confirmed by more robust trials. When looking at the absolute number of failed implants, it can be observed that in one trial comparing four to six implants in edentulous mandibles<B> </B>more failures of implants placed with a 1-stage occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Becktor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Becktor 2007</LINK>). In particular, 17 implants failed in six patients of the 1-stage group versus five implants in four patients of the 2-stage group, and these figures bear important clinical implications. Several factors could have played a role, but<B> </B>the most likely explanation for increased failure rates in edentulous patients when placing implants according to a 1-stage procedure could be that dentures transmitted excessive loading on the healing abutments while the osseointegration process was taking place. A possible contributing factor could be the surface characteristics of the used implants (machined or turned implant surface). In fact it has been hypothesised that implants with a turned surface may be at higher risk for early implant failures (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2007b</LINK>) and this risk could be even increased if these implants are loaded during the bone healing period.<B> </B>
</P>
<P>Peri-implant marginal bone level changes were evaluated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heijdenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heijdenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cecchinato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cecchinato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>). However the baseline measurements were taken at delivery of the prostheses (<LINK REF="STD-Cecchinato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cecchinato 2004</LINK>) or 1 month after the delivery of the overdentures (<LINK REF="STD-Heijdenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heijdenrijk 2002</LINK>), after the effect, if any, of submerging or not the implant had took place. It would have been more useful to use the time of implant placement as baseline, when possible differences, if any, were more likely to be spotted. The only trial that was possible to include did not show any significant difference in bone loss between the two procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becktor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Becktor 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>) reported complications. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barber 1996</LINK>) was not informative since only included five patients and no complication occurred. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>) specifically included patients treated with single immediate postextractive implants and reported three minor complications all occurring in the 2-stage group.<B> </B>Three minor soft tissue dehiscences developed exposing part of the implant cover screws. While this complication can only occur at implants placed according to a 2-stage technique, they might have been more frequent than usual (in more than 20% of the implants) because of the nature of the implant sites included in the study. In fact, only postextractive sites were included and flaps had to be mobilised and stretched to cover the implant head. Under these circumstances soft tissue exposures are more likely to occur.<B> </B>More interesting information was presented in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Becktor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Becktor 2007</LINK>) since more complications occurred.<B> </B>This multicentre trial included 77 patients with edentulous mandibles and complications were described with sufficient detail, but were not presented at patient level, therefore data on complications could not be imputed in the meta-analysis. The impression was that there were much more complications up to abutment connection in the 1-stage group (i.e. soft tissue reactions: 13 versus 2; pain: 18 (in six patients) versus none; non-specified other complications: 13 versus 3).</P>
<P>Aesthetic outcomes were reported only in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cordaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cordaro 2009</LINK>). There were no differences in soft tissue recession around postextractive single implants when using a submerged or non-submerged technique. The authors also evaluated changes in keratinised tissue height and found that at the 1-year follow up there was statistically significant less keratinised tissue (1.1 mm) around implants placed according to a 2-stage technique. While this finding applies to postextractive sites since flaps have to be mobilised to close the socket, thus moving the mucosal junction coronally, it is unlikely to apply in non-postextractive sites when no tissues have to be mobilised.</P>
<P>Generalization of the present findings can be done to other settings, keeping in mind the limited amount of available evidence and that there might be a potential increased risk to have early implant failures and complications when using 1-stage implants in edentulous jaws (<LINK REF="STD-Becktor-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Becktor 2007</LINK>). On the other hand, 1-stage implant placement appears to provide very good results in partially edentulous patients, shortening treatment time and decreasing patient morbidity. When a dentist is faced with the dilemma of submerging or not the implants, some considerations could be made: in case of poor implant stability a submerged technique may be recommendable. In case of excellent implant stability (implants placed with insertion torque &gt; 32 Ncm), implants can be left healing according to a 1-stage procedure but an immediate loading technique could be considered as well (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2009</LINK>). In case that it is expected that a provisional prosthesis could transmit excessive forces on the healing implants, it might be preferable to opt for a more conservative 2-stage procedure.</P>

No statistically significant differences were observed between the two procedures, however trends suggested less implant failures with the 2-stage (submerged) approach especially in fully edentulous patients. If these findings are confirmed by larger trials, the major clinical implication will be that the 1-stage approach might be preferable in partially edentulous patients since it avoids one surgical intervention and shortens treatment times. However, there might be situations, for instance when an implant has not obtained an optimal primary stability or when barriers are used for guided tissue regeneration, or when it is expected that removable temporary prostheses could transmit excessive forces on the penetrating abutments especially in fully edentulous patients, where a 2-stage submerged approach might be still preferable.</P>

<P>More randomised controlled trials with a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. If peri-implant marginal bone level changes on intraoral radiographs are used as an outcome measure, it may be useful to use radiographs taken just after implant placement as baseline measurement. Possible complications should also be thoroughly reported, and aesthetic outcomes could also be evaluated to see whether one of the procedures offers some advantages over the other.</P>
