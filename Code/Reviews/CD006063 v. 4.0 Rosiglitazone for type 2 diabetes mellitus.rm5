<P>Diseases of the heart and blood vessels account for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Compared to their non-diabetic counterparts the relative risk of mortality caused by disorders of the heart and blood vessels is two to three for men and three to four for women with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is mainly characterised by a reduced ability of the hormone insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in body fat and muscles (insulin resistance) and affects most people suffering from diabetes. Several medications are on the market to treat diabetes, amongst them rosiglitazone as a member of the 'glitazones' reduced risk markers for diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Since the two biggest trials in people with type 2 diabetes showed that improved blood glucose alone is not enough to reduce the risk of the above mentioned diseases we looked for longer-term studies investigating 24 weeks as a minimum of rosiglitazone treatment on patient-oriented outcomes. As patient-oriented outcomes we defined mortality, complications of diabetes, side effects of the medication, health-related quality of life, costs and metabolic control (lowering of blood glucose to near normal levels).</P>
<P>Eighteen trials randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone therapy. The longest duration of rosiglitazone treatment was four years, most trials lasted around half a year. Unfortunately, the published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide relevant evidence that patient-oriented outcomes are positively influenced by this agent. The chance of developing oedema was approximately doubled, the risk of cardiovascular diseases increased. The single large randomised controlled trial showed evidence of raised cardiovascular risk after rosiglitazone treatment. Moreover, new safety data show increased numbers of broken bones in women. This finding was published years after approval of this agent by drug regulatory authorities. New ways of exploring drug effects, for example by early long-term studies in many people, as well as public access to all safety data of published and unpublished investigations have to be established.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diabetes has long been recognised as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Prospective studies show that compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four. The two biggest trials in type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study did not reveal a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control. Theoretical benefits of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) activator rosiglitazone on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors might result in fewer macrovascular disease events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of rosiglitazone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adult people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and had a trial duration of at least 24 weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pooling of studies by means of fixed-effects meta-analysis could be performed for adverse events only.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eighteen trials which randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone treatment were identified. Longest duration of therapy was four years with a median of 26 weeks. Published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically relevant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Occurrence of oedema was significantly raised (OR 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.81). The single large RCT (ADOPT - A Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial) indicated increased cardiovascular risk. New data on raised fracture rates in women reveal extensive action of rosiglitazone in various body tissues.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>New studies should focus on patient-oriented outcomes to clarify the benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy. Safety data and adverse events of all investigations (published and unpublished) should be made available to the public.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Group (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>There are two main types of diabetes mellitus, type 1 (formerly termed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 (formerly termed non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus):</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia due to absolute deficiency of insulin secretion which is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. Evidence of autoimmunity is provided by the appearance of autoantibodies prior to the onset of clinical disease. The clinical presentation ranges from mild nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms to coma. Although type 1 diabetes usually develops before 30 years of age, it can occur at any age. At presentation, most patients are thin and have experienced weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and diabetic ketoacidosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the actions and secretion of insulin are impaired, as opposed to the absolute deficiency of insulin that occurs with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by two major pathophysiologic defects: (1) insulin resistance, which results in increased hepatic glucose production and decreased peripheral glucose disposal, (2) impaired &#946;-cell secretory function (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1997</LINK>). Insulin resistance is an impaired biological response to the effects of exogenous or endogenous insulin. Insulin resistance in the hepatic and peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, leads to unrestrained hepatic glucose production and diminished insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake and utilization (<LINK REF="REF-DeFronzo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeFronzo 1992</LINK>). Insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell is initially sufficient to compensate for insulin resistance, thereby maintaining normal blood glucose levels. Hyperinsulinaemia, which accompanies insulin resistance, can maintain sufficiently normal glucose metabolism as long as pancreatic &#946;-cell function remains normal. However, in patients who may develop type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion eventually fails, leading to hyperglycaemia and clinical diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Warram-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warram 1990</LINK>). Individuals with type 2 diabetes may have few or no classic clinical symptoms (see above) of hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Ruige-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruige 1997</LINK>). The difficulty in maintaining metabolic control, for example measured by haemoglobin A<SUB>1c</SUB> (HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>) over time may be related to several behavioral factors (for example difficulties with healthy eating, exercise, medication regimens) but primarily reflects the underlying progressive decline in &#946;-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_16-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-16 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Type 2 diabetes has traditionally been treated in a stepwise manner, starting with lifestyle modifications (<LINK REF="REF-Armour-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armour 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gimenez_x002d_Perez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimenez-Perez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>) and later on pharmacotherapy with oral agents. Several classes of oral agents are available for clinical use. These mainly include insulin secretagogues, drugs that delay the absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin sensitizers. Over time, many patients with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin secretagogues: Currently, the sulphonylureas used are mainly glibenclamide (glyburide), glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride. These drugs stimulate pancreatic &#946;-cell insulin secretion by binding to a sulphonylurea receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Lindberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindberg 2002</LINK>). The short-acting non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogues are repaglinide and nateglinide (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2003</LINK>). These are newer agents that also stimulate insulin secretion by binding to the sulphonylurea receptor.<BR/>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: Acarbose and miglitol are &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors. These drugs slow the absorption of carbohydrates, reducing especially postprandial elevations in plasma glucose levels. They do not significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels but cause a modest reduction in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin sensitizers: Metformin belongs to the biguanides class (<LINK REF="REF-Saenz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2003</LINK>). It might increase insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose production. Metformin also seems to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake in the muscle. The thiazolidinediones consist of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These substances decrease insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; (PPAR&#8722;&#947;) which increases production of proteins involved in glucose uptake. They also decrease hepatic glucose production by improving hepatic insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Meriden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriden 2004</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 13:09:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus can be treated by non-pharmacological (diet, exercise) and pharmacological means. Insulin, as the natural hormone of the body, might be given as animal (mainly pork or beef) insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>), genetically constructed 'human' insulin or as insulin-'analogues' with a modified molecular structure compared to human insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>). Insulin is currently administered by diabetic people in various ways: Subcutaneous injections, insulin pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>), and maybe in future by inhalation (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>). Oral antidiabetic agents are most often used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in its initial stages if lifestyle modifications have failed. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone offer new oral treatment options and affect many tissues and parts of the body. In order to evaluate their effects not only on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus but also on patient-oriented outcomes like cardiovascular disease, longer-term studies of at least 24 weeks continuous intake will be critically appraised in this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>An increase in bodyweight has been associated with rosiglitazone. Oedema, anaemia and congestive heart failure have been reported in patients receiving rosiglitazone. The patients who appear to be at greatest risk of peripheral oedema, fluid retention and weight gain, congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema related to rosiglitazone are probably those who use insulin or have New York Heart Association class II, III or IV cardiac status, left-ventricular dysfunction or renal insufficiency. Some reports of visual impairment in patients taking rosiglitazone were described (<LINK REF="REF-Colucciello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colucciello 2005</LINK>). Case reports of liver function abnormalities associated with rosiglitazone were documented (<LINK REF="REF-Marcy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menees-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menees 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Because traditional agents have a limited impact on insulin resistance and &#946;-cell function, thiazolidinediones may be an appropriate choice especially for combination therapy in patients achieving poor glycaemic control with initial monotherapy. By improving insulin sensitivity, thiazolidinediones may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. The excess cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes cannot be attributed to classic risk factors alone (mainly hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking), but if present, these risk factors are at least as important as in patients without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). One explanation for the beneficial effects of thiazolidinediones is their unique mechanism of action as selective and potent inhibitors of PPAR-&#947;. PPAR-&#947; receptors are present in many tissues like adipose, hepatic and skeletal muscle tissue and control insulin-responsive genes, which have a wide-ranging influence. Thiazolidinediones appear to improve markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis, exert beneficial effects on vascular reactivity, improve the lipid profile and fat distribution, and decrease pancreatic &#946;-cell injury.<BR/>Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione group which also encompasses troglitazone (withdrawn due to hepatic toxicity) and pioglitazone. It increases the sensitivity of skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue to insulin without directly stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic ß-cells, thereby reducing plasma glucose levels and endogenous glucose production (<LINK REF="REF-Wagstaff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagstaff 2002</LINK>). Differences in the side chain on the main thiazolidine-structure in comparison to pioglitazone are thought to be responsible for the distinct bioavailability, metabolism and antihyperglycaemic potency of rosiglitazone. Although rosiglitazone appears to be associated with some effects that are not mediated by PPAR-&#947; (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2001</LINK>), binding of rosiglitazone to this receptor seems to be the important component of its mechanism of action. Rosiglitazone has several pharmacodynamic properties which could ameliorate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, rosiglitazone has been associated with reductions in the levels of small dense low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) - despite overall increases in total LDL-C - and increases in the levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Diastolic and systolic blood pressure are thought to be decreased after rosiglitazone treatment. Some other surrogate parameters indicating especially cardiovascular risk were reported to be positively influenced by rosiglitazone therapy.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-07 00:43:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes has long been recognised as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Laakso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laakso 1999</LINK>). Prospective studies show that compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). The increased cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is reflected in the observation that middle-aged individuals with diabetes have mortality and morbidity risks that are similar to non-diabetic individuals who have already suffered a cardiovascular event (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1998</LINK>).<BR/>Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease (for example diabetic retinopathy) but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study was the first published long-term investigation of people with type 2 diabetes indicating no reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control but raised cardiovascular mortality after tolbutamide treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UGDP-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">UGDP 1982</LINK>). The study of Ohkubo et al. which included relatively lean Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, was the first to demonstrate prevention of microvascular complications by intensive glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Ohkubo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohkubo 1995</LINK>). This study did not address the question of whether good glycaemic control retards the progression of macrovascular disease. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) tested mainly whether intensive glucose control with either a sulphonylurea or insulin influences the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications compared with conventional treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). The 10-year results of the UKPDS evaluated drug treatment in non obese and obese participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were referred to hospital clinics. Over 10 years, HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> was 7.0% in the intensive group compared with 7.9% in the conventional group. The 0.9% difference in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> between the intensive and conventional groups over 10 years was smaller than the 1.9% difference (9.0% and 7.1%) in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The DCCT studied younger patients with type 1 diabetes and assessed the effects of intensive versus conventional insulin therapy on the incidence of microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) over a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>). The risk of retinopathy, for example, was statistically significant reduced by intensive insulin therapy with a number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit of six (six type 1 diabetic patients need to be treated by intensive in comparison to conventional insulin therapy over 6.5 years to avoid one additional patient to develop diabetic retinopathy). The UKPDS had a factorial design meaning that another study investigating intensive versus regular blood pressure control (<LINK REF="REF-HDS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>) was imbedded in the main study. Intensive versus conventional glucose control did not result in a statistically significant difference in diabetes related mortality or macrovascular disease endpoints but reduced the relative risk in the 'any diabetes related aggregate endpoint' (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2003</LINK>). Most of this benefit was due to a reduction in microvascular endpoints including the incidence of retinal photocoagulation, which was assessed by ophthalmologists independent of the study. In the UKPDS, the NNT to prevent one patient developing any of the single endpoints over 10 years was 20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 500) patients (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). In contrast to these results, publication of the UKPDS-34, which focused on obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, found several clinically important differences in macrovascular disease endpoints with 10 years of treatment with metformin (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-34 1998</LINK>). In particular, the absolute risk reduction for the aggregate endpoints was more than 10% and for overall mortality was 7%, giving NNTs of 10 and 14, respectively, over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2003</LINK>).<BR/>The UKPDS was criticised on several grounds especially emphasising hidden biases in interpreting the results of this randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1998</LINK>). Stratton et al. in their UKPDS-35 publication are often cited, who tried to determine the relation between exposure to glycaemia over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in the UKPDS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>). This publication is an epidemiological re-interpretation of UKPDS data proclaiming that with each 1% reduction in mean HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, reductions in risk of 21% for deaths related to diabetes and 14% for myocardial infarction could be observed. The RCT itself, though, did not show significant differences in this respect. Moreover, the UKPDS-38, investigating tight versus less tight blood pressure control with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a &#946;-blocker atenolol as main treatment, showed relative risk reductions (in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control) of 24% in diabetes related endpoints, 32% in deaths related to diabetes, 44% in strokes and 37% in microvascular endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>). Due to the factorial design of the UKPDS with two interventions (improvement in metabolic and blood pressure control) aiming at the same outcomes, a fair interpretation of the data needs investigation of the interaction between the two main treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2003</LINK>). UKPDS data should be available to the scientific public to evaluate, among other things, the importance of the individual contribution of improved glucose versus blood pressure control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, until now this has not happened.<BR/>Therefore, any new compound in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, like rosiglitazone, should not only be evaluated with regards to surrogate outcomes (for example reductions in fasting plasma glucose or HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>) but information is urgently needed for the influence of any antidiabetic agent especially on cardiovascular endpoints, which is the greatest problem in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Quite a number of health technology assessment reports, (narrative) reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses analysed interventions with rosiglitazone in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Bloomgarden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomgarden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiquette-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiquette 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czoski_x002d_Murray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czoski-Murray 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreider-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreider 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lebovitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebovitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malinowski-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinowski 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mukhtar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhtar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagstaff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagstaff 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wellington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellington 2005</LINK>). All of them either suffer from methodological problems like insufficient quality assessment of primary studies, focus on surrogate outcomes or are out-of-date. This systematic review tries to collate all available data from RCTs of rosiglitazone treatment and evaluates how many studies investigated patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, cardiovascular endpoints, adverse events and health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review on the effects of pioglitazone treatment has already been published (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2006</LINK>). For changes to the published protocol see <LINK REF="APP-12" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 12</LINK>.</P>

<P>Adult persons (18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

<P>No study included mortality as a primary or secondary endpoint.<BR/>The ADOPT trial investigated rosiglitazone, metformin and glyburide (glibenclamide) as initial treatment for recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus by means of a double-blind RCT involving more than 4000 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2006</LINK>). Eligible participants were between 30 and 75 years, with fasting plasma glucose levels between 126 to 180 mg/dl (7.0 to 10.0 mmol/L) and were treated by life style management only. The primary outcome was the time from randomisation to treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as confirmed hyperglycaemia, that is fasting plasma glucose levels greater than 180 mg/dl on consecutive testing or according to the decision of an independent adjudication committee. Median duration of treatment was 4.0 years for rosiglitazone and metformin and 3.3 years for glyburide. At five years, when around 20% of the original cohort was being followed, the reported cumulative incidence of treatment failure was 15% in the rosiglitazone group and 21%/34% in the metformin/glyburide group, respectively. The mean HbA1c level at four years compared to max. 2g/day metformin and max. 15 mg/day glyburide, was 0.1% and 0.4% less after max. 8 mg/day rosiglitazone therapy. Attrition rates were high in the ADOPT study: 37%, 38% and 44% did not finish the study in the rosiglitazone, metformin and glyburide groups. Mortality data were reported in Table 2 of the publication ('Adverse events, laboratory assessment, concomitant use of cardiovascular drugs, hospitalization, and death'): All-cause mortality was 34/1456 (2.3%) in the rosiglitazone group, 31/1454 (2.1%) in the metformin group and 31/1441 (2.2%) in the glyburide group.</P>

<P>The percentage of overall adverse events was comparable between the intervention and control groups, serious adverse events appeared to happen somewhat more often after rosiglitazone treatment (median of 6% versus 4% in the control groups). Median discontinuation rate following rosiglitazone administration was also higher than after control therapy (median of 7% versus 4%).<BR/>Three studies evaluated and reported a more pronounced (apparently dose-related) decrease of haemoglobin after rosiglitazone intake in comparison to other active compounds or placebo. Haemoglobin reductions ranged between 0.5 and 1.0 g/dl.<BR/>Eleven studies evaluated body weight and observed an increase up to 5.0 kg after rosiglitazone treatment, four studies described changes in body mass index up to a rise of 1.5 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>.<BR/>Seven of the 18 included studies showed data on hypoglycaemic episodes: Compared to active monotherapy control rosiglitazone treatment resulted in somewhat lower rates of hypoglycaemia, especially when compared to sulphonylureas. Severe hypoglycaemic events were rarely reported.</P>
<P>Data on the specific adverse event "oedema" were available in nine of 18 studies. Overall, 4739 participants provided information on the occurrence of oedema. The total number of events was 287 in the rosiglitazone and 134 in the control groups. Pooling of the nine studies by means of fixed-effect meta-analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.81, P &lt; 0.00001). The test for heterogeneity indicated an I<SUP>2</SUP>-value of 53.4%. The use of a random-effects model resulted in an odds ratio of 4.62 (95% CI 2.28 to 9.38, P &lt; 0.00001). The robustness of this result was tested by repeating the analysis using the risk ratio as a different measure of effect size, demonstrating a relative risk of 2.10 (95% CI 1.72 to 2.55) for the fixed-effect model. Since oedema event rates in most studies were below 10%, application of the odds ratio appeared to be the more valid parameter.<BR/>We repeated the analysis excluding the large ADOPT study which had a weight of 89.4% in the fixed-effect model. The odds ratio in the fixed-effect model now was 6.04 (95% CI 3.31 to 11.02, P &lt; 0.00001) and 6.79 (95% CI 3.76 to 12.25, P &lt; 0.00001). Heterogeneity decreased to an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 0%.

<P>This systematic review shows that published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically significant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. One study investigated economic costs of rosiglitazone versus insulin glargine therapy indicating lower costs of insulin glargine treatment. Occurrence of oedema was approximately doubled.</P>

<P>The insulin-sensitising thiazolidinediones pioglitazone and rosiglitazone act as potent inhibitors of the peroxisome-proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) &#947;. Several PPARs exist with different expressions in various tissues. Activation of PPAR-&#947; by thiazolidinediones may cause an increase in bone marrow adiposity and a decrease in osteoblastogenesis, resulting in reduced bone formation. Several publications of animal and human data are available (<LINK REF="REF-Ali-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ali 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lazarenko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarenko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaturu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaturu 2007</LINK>). To our knowledge, the ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial) - <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2006</LINK>) study was the first randomised controlled clinical trial which demonstrated increased rates of fractures in women. According to the pharmaceutical company producing pioglitazone, a re-analysis of the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events) study (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2005</LINK>) showed that 44/870 (5.1%) fractures were observed in pioglitazone treated female patients compared to 23/905 (2.5%) controls.<BR/>It is unclear why it took so long to analyse adverse events in an appropriate way. Adverse reactions on fracture rates only showed up in a "Note added in proof" in the New England Journal of Medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2006</LINK>) and the PROactive study publication did not mention this side effect at all (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2005</LINK>). For an adequate analysis of possible adverse events of published and unpublished data adverse events information should be freely available to the public and researches alike which should pose no problems with nowadays information technology.<BR/>Just before finishing this review a meta-analysis on the effect of rosiglitazone on the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes was published (<LINK REF="REF-Nissen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissen 2007</LINK>). Nissen and Wolski analysed 42 trials of rosiglitazone treatment with a study duration of more than 24 weeks. They found in the rosiglitazone group, as compared with the control group, a significant increase of the odds ratio for myocardial infarction of 1.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.98, P = 0.03. The odds ratio for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64 (95% CI 0.98 to 2.74, P = 0.06). Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and GlaxoSmithKline issued statements and warnings with regards to this meta-analysis. Using the data from Nissen and Wolski we performed another meta-analysis of the myocardial infarction rates for type 2 diabetes only, analysing all studies, rosiglitazone versus monotherapy and rosiglitazone versus combination therapies (in the original publication several other conditions were included as well to investigate the overall cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone). So far and limited to the sparse data available, we could not confirm significant differences in odds ratios of rosiglitazone versus controls. On the other hand, all odds ratios (with the exception of the comparator glyburide - three studies only) indicated an increased risk of rosiglitazone treatment, albeit not a statistically significant difference.<BR/>Moreover, it is disturbing to hear that the manufacturer of rosiglitazone (Avandia) provided the FDA with a pooled analysis of 42 RCTs in which rosiglitazone was compared to either placebo or other antidiabetic therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes. The meta-analysis suggested that patients receiving short-term (most studies were of six months duration) treatment with rosiglitazone may have a 30% greater relative risk of heart attacks and other heart-related adverse events than patients treated with placebo or another antidiabetic therapy. Questions of timing of this information and how it was circled arise. Ongoing trials using rosiglitazone (<LINK REF="STD-RECORD" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD</LINK>) may provide additional data but for a drug which was approved in 1999, the delay in obtaining information about the benefit-risk ratio is considerable.</P>
<P>The one major ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-RECORD" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD</LINK>) which eventually could contribute valuable information about the role of rosiglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (for details see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).<BR/>In the FDA statement 'FDA issues safety alert on Avandia' it is mentioned that "... other published and unpublished data from long-term clinical trials of Avandia, including an interim analysis of data from the <LINK REF="STD-RECORD" TYPE="STUDY">RECORD</LINK> trial (a large, ongoing, randomized open label trial) and unpublished re analyses of data from DREAM (a previously conducted placebo-controlled, randomized trial) provide contradictory evidence about the risks in patients treated with Avandia." We do hope that the conduct, analysis and interpretation of this trial will reflect high quality scientific standards and will not resemble the dishonourable events which accompanied the PROactive study (for more details, see <LINK REF="REF-Richter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2006</LINK>). We agree with the commentators on the Nissen and Wolski publication that current drug approval for antidiabetic medications and possibly all new drugs needs to be changed (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2007</LINK>). The benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus needs urgent clarification.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 13:20:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We focused on a minimum duration of 24 weeks rosiglitazone therapy in order to have a chance to detect clinically meaningful differences in patient-oriented parameters. Theoretically, studies of a shorter duration could demonstrate a significant impact on these outcomes but this is highly unlikely, even with regards to important adverse events.<BR/>Moreover, it was difficult to separate primary studies from companion papers because the latter quite often did not identify themselves as an additional publication of a parent study; especially authors Derosa et al did not reference multiple publications to each other (for details see 'References of included studies', primary studies are marked by an asterisk).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review shows that published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically significant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Occurrence of oedema was approximately doubled. New safety data on increased rates of fractures and possibly the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease should lead to a very cautious approach to rosiglitazone use. If possible, other antidiabetic medications should be employed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Patient-oriented endpoint studies are urgently needed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The use of proxy indicators like metabolic control is not sufficient to approve drugs which many patients have to take for the rest of their lives. It appears questionable whether new studies with rosiglitazone will be ethical given the fact that less dangerous therapeutic alternatives exist.</P>

<P>an independent adjudication<BR/>committee, whose members were unaware of assignments<BR/>to treatment groups, used prespecified criteria (available<BR/>at www.nejm.org) to determine whether the primary outcome<BR/>was reached in cases in which a confirmatory fasting plasma glucose level had not been obtained, a patient had withdrawn because of an insufficient therapeutic effect, or an additional glucose lowering drug had been administered before the<BR/>confirmation of hyperglycemia (according to a protocol<BR/>amendment adopted in February 2004)</P>
<P>the threshold of more than 180 mg per deciliter for confirmed hyperglycemia was selected to<BR/>represent unequivocal failure in the maintenance of adequate glycemic control without incurring undue hyperglycemic symptoms; the threshold of a fasting plasma glucose level of more than<BR/>140 mg per deciliter for increasing the dose of a study drug reflected clinical guidelines at the time of study design.<BR/>SECONDARY OUTCOMES:<BR/>time from randomization to a confirmed fasting plasma glucose level of more than 140 mg per deciliter after at least 6 weeks of treatment at the<BR/>maximum-tolerated dose of a study drug (for patients who entered the study with a fasting plasma glucose level of 140 mg per deciliter or less)</P>
<P>other prespecified outcomes were levels of fasting plasma<BR/>glucose and glycated hemoglobin, weight, and<BR/>measures of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, as determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA 2) with the use of the HOMA calculator (www.dtu.ox.ac.uk)</P>

<P>safety was assessed in the intent to treat (ITT) population through adverse events, hypoglycaemia, body weight, physical examinations, vital signs, standard hematology,and blood chemistry</P>
<P>a physical examination to identify signs of peripheral oedema was performed at baseline and final visit or at patient discontinuation</P>
<P>Cost analysis:<BR/>The economic costs of glyceemic control were compared by combining selected measures of resource use with unit-cost estimates. Resource measures included study medication, other antihyperglycaemic agents, syringes for insulin glargine,<BR/>glucose testing supplies for both groups, and recommended liver function tests for the rosiglitazone group. Resource use was<BR/>based on trial data over the 24-week period. Costs of medications, insulin syringes, test strips, and lancets were<BR/>estimated using average wholesale prices expressed in 2002 U.S. dollars and were based on the numbers actually dispensed. The cost of hepatic function panels was estimated using fee schedules under Medicare&#8217;s Resource-Based Relative Value Scale. Economic costs were summarized using means and 95% CIs and calculated through techniques of bootstrapping. Results were not adjusted for differences between treatment</P>

<TITLE>Dollow, July 2007</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The following query was made on 18 July 2007:</P>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration has a reputation for robustness of analysis and integrity of data interpretation. Therefore, it was disappointing to read the conclusions made in the recent Cochrane Review written by Richter et al, titled, "Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus."</P>
<P>The authors drew conclusions regarding the impact of rosiglitazone on mortality and morbidity by reviewing a limited number of short term studies (18) primarily designed to assess glycaemic control. This analysis cannot provide a full picture of all the research conducted with rosiglitazone. The conclusions provide no new evidence about the role of rosiglitazone in clinical practice. In addition, the conclusions regarding cardiovascular safety disagree with the authors' own meta-analysis on myocardial infarction which could not confirm an increased risk.</P>
<P>The studies assessed in the review contained no stratification for baseline cardiovascular risk, leading to unavoidable imbalances between rosiglitazone and control groups. Most importantly the authors fail to include the interim findings of RECORD(1), a prospective long- term study primarily designed to evaluate the profile of rosiglitazone with respect to cardiovascular disease. The RECORD(1) data was available as an online publication some six weeks prior to the publication of this review. Its exclusion is surprising and adds question to the robustness of the authors' conclusions.</P>
<P>Questions about the safety of rosiglitazone should be answered by reviewing all relevant evidence, in particular long-term prospective trials. The conclusion regarding the cardiovascular data from ADOPT(2,3) are puzzling, given that in ADOPT(2,3) all major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were analysed and found to be rare in this population and comparable for all treatments - rosiglitazone, glibenclamide and metformin.. Additionally, no excess in mortality with rosiglitazone was seen overall. The significant benefits of rosiglitazone in maintaining the duration of glycaemic response in ADOPT(2) are unfortunately not given similar prominence. </P>
<P>The interim findings of RECORD(1), the only study specifically designed to look at cardiovascular outcomes with rosiglitazone, does not show evidence of a difference in cardiovascular death between rosiglitazone and control groups. Additionally, no significant differences for myocardial infarction between groups were seen.</P>
<P>The totality of the data - including long-term studies such as ADOPT(2) and RECORD(3) and a real-world epidemiological analysis of 33,000 patients(5) - show that rosiglitazone has a comparable ischaemic cardiovascular profile to the most commonly used oral anti-diabetic medicines, metformin and sulphonylureas.</P>
<P>With respect to the analysis of glycaemic efficacy, it is puzzling that the authors excluded a number of studies which are applicable to decisions made in clinical practice, such as Bailey et al(4) in which uptitration of metformin is compared with metformin and rosiglitazone. Additionally, whilst a significant decrease in the rate of hypoglycaemia associated with rosiglitazone is reported in the results section of the review, this is not referred to in the authors' conclusions. Instead, only oedema is mentioned, which is a well recognised side-effect of thiazolidenedione therapy. </P>
<P>The studies selected for use in a Cochrane systematic review should be appropriate to the purpose of the review. It is therefore difficult to understand how the limited range of studies selected from the much larger number of studies available, allow the authors to draw robust conclusions with respect to morbidity, mortality and health-outcomes for rosiglitazone. In addition, the conclusions drawn regarding ischaemic cardiovascular safety should be substantiated by the data analysed and not inferred from statistically insignificant odds ratios. </P>
<P>Finally we question the appropriateness of raising comment about the timing of data release to regulatory authorities and regulatory approval requirements in diabetes as part of a systematic review. GSK has actively shared data on rosiglitazone with regulatory agencies worldwide in a timely manner. The company carries out its clinical trials with the highest level of ethical conduct and is committed to patient safety. </P>

</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The comments by Dr Dollow are answered in a point-by-point fashion:</P>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration as well as the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group adhere to high quality standards. It is unclear how Dr Dollow defines "integrity of data interpretation". As a matter of course, the discussion and conclusion sections are firmly based upon the data evaluated in our review.</P>
<P>The types of interventions we included had to have a minimum trial duration of 24 weeks. The point that a limited number of studies had a longer duration, for example more than one year, is due to the fact that neither the manufacturer nor the scientific community seems to be interested in the long-term benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy, but cannot be attributed to the review itself. Furthermore, the bulk of studies investigated glycaemic control as primary efficacy endpoint and not patient-oriented parameters like mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life which again has to be ascribed to the deficiencies of studies but not the systematic review. Our review so far provides the best overview of the risks and (with regard to relevant outcomes) missing benefits of rosiglitazone therapy and therefore is of great importance for clinical practice. We did not perform our own meta-analysis on myocardial infarction but tried to replicate the findings by Nissen et al using their data in the discussion section of our review (Nissen 2007). Cardiovascular disease and safety in their clinical meaning include more than myocardial infarction, for example increased risk of congestive heart failure following rosiglitazone therapy. Therefore, we stand by the conclusions as stated in the review.</P>
<P>The studies and publications we discovered and assessed in our review - with the exception of the ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) - did not investigate cardiovascular risk. That is one of the reasons why Nissen et al (Nissen 2007) had to search the manufacturer's as well as drug authorities web sites. The publication schedule of the Cochrane Library demands from Cochrane review groups to hand in their "module" (all new and updated protocols and reviews) around two months before the publication of the Cochrane Library. Therefore, the interim findings of the RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes) study could not be included in our review (Home 2007). Furthermore, these interim data do not provide assurance of the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see below).</P>
<P>We agree that questions about the safety of rosiglitazone should be answered by critical appraisal of especially well-performed long-term randomised controlled clinical trials. With regard to the cardiovascular data from the ADOPT trial Dr Dollow mentions a letter to the Lancet editor by Dr Krall, Chief Medical Officer of GlaxoSmithKline. It is of interest to note that this letter to the editor which refers to the Nissen et al publication was published in the Lancet and not the New England Journal of Medicine where the study originally was published. The new endpoint MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events, that is all cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarction serious adverse events (fatal and non-fatal), and stroke serious adverse events (fatal and non-fatal)) was not part of the original publication of the ADOPT trial, resulted from a post-hoc analysis by the manufacturer and "forgot" to mention congestive heart failure which was part of the outcomes contributing to the overall endpoint cardiovascular disease. Here, significant differences between glyburide (glibenclamide) and rosiglitazone were reported, indicating increased cardiovascular disease risk after rosiglitazone therapy, as mentioned in our review. The ADOPT trial was not powered to investigate mortality. The primary outcome time from randomisation to treatment failure as measured by elevated fasting plasma glucose levels was not part of our pre-specified outcomes but we agree with the accompanying New England Journal of Medicine editorial stating "the choice of time to failure based on a confirmed fasting glucose level of more than 180 mg per deciliter as the primary outcome, rather than one based upon glycated hemoglobin levels, seems anachronistic " (Nathan 2006).</P>
<P>The unscheduled interim analysis from the RECORD trial should not be interpreted as evidence for cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone therapy (Home 2007). We once again agree with the statements of the associated editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (Nathan 2007): <BR/>"The primary end point of the RECORD trial consists of an aggregate of time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular event or death from cardiovascular causes" ... "Unfortunately, this interim analysis, performed after a mean of 3.75 years (about 60% of the planned 6-year duration of the study) fails to provide exculpatory evidence" ... "RECORD extremely underpowered for the primary outcome" ... "the results of this underpowered interim analysis suggest a possible adverse effect of treatment with rosiglitazone on the primary outcome, rather than the benefit that was hypothesized ... considering the low power of the study and the trend for more adverse outcomes in the rosiglitazone-treated group, it is highly unlikely that the study will ever establish a cardiovascular benefit for rosiglitazone" ... "In the aggregate, however, these analyses support a concern regarding the safety of rosiglitazone" ... "It is reasonable to ask whether physicians should feel comfortable using a drug that might have an 8% excess risk of severe cardiovascular disease or death from cardiovascular causes" ... "Unless further studies provide convincing assurance that treatment with rosiglitazone does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, the largely circumstantial evidence of the meta-analyses and the nonsignificant trend in the current report from the RECORD trial must be taken seriously" ... "The jury may still be out with regard to the cardiotoxicity of rosiglitazone, but when it comes to patient safety, "first, do no harm" should outweigh any presumption of innocence."</P>
<P>As demonstrated above, the totality of data do not show that rosiglitazone has a comparable ischaemic cardiovascular profile to the most commonly used oral antidiabetic medicines. To claim a comparable ischaemic cardiovascular risk profile especially to metformin in obese type 2 diabetes patients appears careless: Contrary to rosiglitazone treatment metformin positively influences patient-oriented outcomes since the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that patients allocated metformin had significant reductions for any-diabetes related endpoint, diabetes-related death, stroke and all-cause mortality (UKPDS-34). </P>
<P>Dr Dollow claims that "authors excluded a number of studies which are applicable to decisions made in clinical practice, such as Bailey et al(4) in which uptitration of metformin is compared with metformin and rosiglitazone". In the 'criteria for considering studies for this review' we clearly exemplified under 'excluded interventions': "Combination therapies consisting of different compounds in the treatment arms (for example rosiglitazone plus metformin versus uptitration of metformin or rosiglitazone plus gliclazide versus gliclazide). Another Cochrane review will investigate rosiglitazone-metformin combination therapies including different treatment regimens of these compounds." We want to perform another Cochrane review on different combination partners because it does not appear to be adequate to compare interventions with different combination partners neglecting the complicated interplay of various agents. Furthermore, we did not report on a significant decrease in the rate of hypoglycaemia associated with rosiglitazone but stated "Seven of the 18 included studies showed data on hypoglycaemic episodes: Compared to active monotherapy control rosiglitazone treatment resulted in somewhat lower rates of hypoglycaemia, especially when compared to sulphonylureas. Severe hypoglycaemic events were rarely reported." Apart from that, serious adverse events were noted more often after rosiglitazone treatment as were higher median discontinuation rates compared to control therapy. </P>
<P>Our studies selected for this review were indeed appropriate to our objectives. To speak of a "limited range of studies selected from the much larger number of studies available" does not understand our strategy. We especially focused on patient-oriented parameters like mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life and adequately reported on all available study results according to our in- and exclusion criteria. Unfortunately, the availability of sound studies is scarce due to the fact that concerning this matter only the ADOPT and the RECORD trial provide some hypotheses about the benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy which does not appear to be positive (see above).</P>
<P>According to Krall (Krall 2007), GlaxoSmithKline performed similar meta-analyses in 2005 and 2006 and found similar results as Nissen et al (Nissen 2007). We are not aware that the public was adequately informed about these results, otherwise the meta-analysis by Nissen et al would not have aroused such a huge public interest. It is well know that glycosylated haemoglobin is a relatively poor surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes and these data urgently suggest that we need to change the regulatory pathway for drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to make clinical outcomes, not surrogates, the primary endpoint (Rosen 2007). It would be prudent for one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world being committed to patient care to engage in relevant clinical studies of patient-oriented outcomes from the very beginning on.</P>

<P>The following changes to the published protocol with regards to 'types of intervention' were implemented:<BR/>
<BR/>The following comparisons were acceptable for evaluation:<BR/>- rosiglitazone versus placebo;<BR/>- rosiglitazone versus another oral antidiabetic medication (meglitinide analogues, metformin, pioglitazone, sulphonylureas);<BR/>- rosiglitazone in combination with an oral antidiabetic medication or insulin versus a combination of an oral antidiabetic medication or insulin (agents and treatment schemes had to be identical).<BR/>
<BR/>Excluded interventions:<BR/>Combination therapies consisting of different compounds in the treatment arms (for example rosiglitazone plus metformin versus uptitration of metformin or rosiglitazone plus gliclazide versus gliclazide). Another Cochrane review will investigate rosiglitazone-metformin combination therapies including different treatment regimens of these compounds. Furthermore, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus are excluded, since these are the topic of another Cochrane review (Richter 2007), as well as glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes mellitus (Cochrane review, Snaith 2007).</P>
