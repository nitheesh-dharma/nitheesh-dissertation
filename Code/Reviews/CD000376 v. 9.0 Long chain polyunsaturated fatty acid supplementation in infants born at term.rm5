<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Does feeding full-term babies with formula milk enriched with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) result in improved vision and overall neurodevelopment compared with feeding formula milk not enriched with LCPUFA?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> LCPUFA is a type of fat that is essential for the development of brain and vision in newborn babies. Breast milk contains adequate amounts of LCPUFA and hence is considered better than formula milk. Some milk formulae with added LCPUFA are commercially available.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> This review analysed studies that compared outcomes of full-term babies (born at &#8805; 37 weeks of pregnancy) who were given formula milk enriched with LCPUFA versus outcomes of full-term babies fed formula milk without enrichment with LCPUFA.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> Review authors found that full-term babies fed formula milk supplemented with LCPUFA did not have better outcomes than were reported for full-term babies fed formula milk without LCPUFA.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B> We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:29:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are considered essential for maturation of the developing brain, retina and other organs in newborn infants. Standard infant milk formulae are not supplemented with LCPUFA; they contain only alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, from which formula-fed infants must synthesise their own DHA and AA, respectively. Over the past few years, some manufacturers have added LCPUFA to formula milk and have marketed these products as providing an advantage for the overall development of full-term infants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:40:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess whether supplementation of formula milk with LCPUFA is both safe and beneficial for full-term infants, while focusing on effects on visual function, neurodevelopment and physical growth.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:42:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; December 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to December 2016), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to December 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1980 to December 2016) and abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies (2000 to 2016). We applied no language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-01 14:54:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the guidelines of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. When appropriate, we conducted meta-analysis to determine a pooled estimate of effect.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 01:15:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 31 RCTs and included 15 of these in the review (N = 1889).</P>
<P>Nine studies assessed visual acuity, six of which used visual evoked potentials (VEP), two Teller cards and one both. Four studies reported beneficial effects, and the remaining five did not. Meta-analysis of three RCTs showed significant benefit for sweep VEP acuity at 12 months (log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)) (mean difference (MD) -0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to -0.13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0; three trials; N = 244), but meta-analysis of three other RCTs showed no benefit for visual acuity measured with Teller cards at 12 months (cycles/degree) (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.11; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0; three trials; N = 256). GRADE analysis for the outcome of visual acuity indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>
<P>Eleven studies measured neurodevelopmental outcomes at or before two years. Nine studies used Bayley Scales of Infant Development, version II (BSID-II), and only two of these studies reported beneficial effects. Meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between LCPUFA and placebo groups in BSID Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.06, 95% CI -2.01 to 2.14; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%; four trials; N = 661) and no significant differences in BSID Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.69, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.16; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%; four trials; N = 661). Results showed no significant differences between the two groups in BSID-II scores at one year and two years of age. One study reported better novelty preference measured by the Fagan Infant Test at nine months. Another study reported better problem solving at 10 months. One study used the Brunet and Lezine test to assess the developmental quotient and found no beneficial effects. Follow-up of some infants in different studies at three, six and nine years of age revealed no beneficial effects of supplementation. GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>
<P>Thirteen studies measured physical growth; none found beneficial or harmful effects of supplementation. Meta-analysis of five RCTs showed that the supplemented group had lower weight (z scores) at one year of age (MD -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.06; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%; N = 521) and that the two groups showed no significant differences with respect to length and head circumference (z scores). Meta-analysis at 18 months and at two years revealed no significant differences between the two groups with respect to weight (kg), length (cm) and head circumference (cm). GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 00:39:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the included RCTs reported no beneficial effects or harms of LCPUFA supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes of formula-fed full-term infants and no consistent beneficial effects on visual acuity. Routine supplementation of full-term infant milk formula with LCPUFA cannot be recommended at this time.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:26:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The perinatal omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is considered essential for cortical circuit maturation in the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2015</LINK>). Strong evidence based on animal and human studies indicates that the n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) is also critical for infant growth, brain development and health (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2016)</LINK>. Evidence suggesting that breast-fed infants have a long-term developmental advantage over formula-fed infants has been available for many years (Anderson 1999; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow_x002d_Tlucak-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow-Tlucak 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oddy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oddy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temboury-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temboury 1994</LINK>). Although most of these studies did not relate their findings to fatty acid supply, some reports suggest that low levels of LCPUFA found in formula-fed infants may contribute to lower IQ scores (<LINK REF="REF-Bjerve-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjerve 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuringer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuringer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1978</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:37:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dietary fat is fundamental during infancy for providing energy, fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids. Interest has recently focused on the importance of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) such as DHA and AA in infant nutrition. These fatty acids are found in high proportions in the structural lipids of cell membranes, particularly those of the central nervous system and retina (<LINK REF="REF-Fleith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleith 2005</LINK>). Their accretion occurs primarily during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Clandinin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clandinin 1980</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:37:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>LCPUFA are supplied via placental transfer during pregnancy and through breast milk after birth. Standard infant formulae contain only the precursor essential fatty acids (EFA) alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, the omega-3 precursor) and linoleic acid (LA, the omega-6 precursor), from which formula-fed infants must synthesise their own DHA and AA, respectively. The absence of LCPUFA in formula may be exacerbated by inhibited incorporation of endogenously produced LCPUFA by high concentrations of LA in some formulae.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-02 00:42:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Biochemical studies in term and preterm infants indicate that infants fed formula not supplemented with LCPUFA have significantly less DHA and AA in their erythrocytes relative to those fed breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1992</LINK>). Studies have also demonstrated that infants fed formula milk have lower levels of LCPUFA in the cerebral cortex compared with breast-fed infants (<LINK REF="REF-Farquharson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquharson 1995</LINK>), suggesting that infant formulae containing only LA and ALA may not be effective in meeting the full EFA requirements of infants. Hence supplementing formula milk with DHA and AA may improve the outcomes of formula-fed infants.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-02 00:43:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a non-randomised study, investigators reported that term infants fed breast milk had better visual evoked potential (VEP) acuities and higher DHA levels than those receiving formula, and that visual function correlated with DHA status (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 1993</LINK>). Over the past few years, many manufacturers have added LCPUFA to milk formulae for term infants and have frequently marketed these products as providing an advantage for infant development. The cost of supplemented formulae is generally higher than that of non-supplemented formulae. A systematic review of randomised and non-randomised trials in term infants concluded that use of term formula supplemented with DHA can improve visual acuity at two months and probably at four months of age (<LINK REF="REF-SanGiovanni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SanGiovanni 2000</LINK>). Another review of both animal and human studies (<LINK REF="REF-McCann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCann 2005</LINK>) concluded that animals with experimentally induced severe DHA deficiency benefit from DHA supplementation in their diet but that effects on cognitive outcomes in human studies are inconclusive. Meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2005</LINK>) and previous versions of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2011</LINK>) found neither benefit nor harm for term infants supplemented with DHA alone or with both DHA and AA.</P>
<P>We conducted this review to update existing evidence on the effect of LCPUFA supplementation on formula-fed full-term infants.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 00:45:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, which included electronic searches of MEDLINE (1946 to December 2016), Embase (1980 to December 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to December 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; December 2016). We also searched e-abstracts of Paediatric Academic Societies meetings (2000 to 2016) and searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant articles by using the following MeSH terms or text words: [Polyunsaturated fatty acids OR Arachidonic Acid OR Docosahexaenoic acid OR Omega-3 Fatty acids OR Omega-6 fatty acids OR N-3 Fatty Acid OR N-6 Fatty Acid] AND [Infant, Newborn OR Infant OR Infant Formula]. We restricted final citations to Clinical Trial OR Randomised Controlled Trial OR Pragmatic Clinical Trial. We reviewed the reference lists of published narrative and systematic reviews to identify potential RCTs. We applied no language restrictions. Three review authors (SR, BJ and SP) independently searched various databases to identify trials that would be eligible for inclusion. We contacted study authors to ask that they clarify reported data or provide additional data including details of study methods. We sent study authors a standardised table and asked them to provide missing data not included in their published article.</P>
<P>We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and recently completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; who.int/ictrp).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that fulfilled the selection criteria. SR, BJ and SP screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies and obtained full-text articles for all potentially relevant trials. SR, BJ and SP assessed independently the full text of these reports to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the review. We resolved disagreements by discussion among all review authors and by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>SR and BJ separately extracted, assessed and coded all data for each study using a form that was designed specifically for this review. SR contacted trial authors to clarify methods and to obtain additional information. For each study, SR entered final data into RevMan and SP checked the data as entered. We resolved disagreements by discussion and by consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (SR and BJ) independently assessed the risk of bias (low, high or unclear) of all included trials using the Cochrane &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) for the following domains: sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and any other bias. We resolved all disagreements by discussion and by consensus. See <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for a detailed description of risk of bias for each domain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We included no categorical outcomes data in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>If available, we planned to combine results from cluster trials with results from other trials by using generic inverse variance methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>If participant drop-out led to missing data, we planned to conduct intention-to-treat analyses. We endeavoured to obtain missing data by contacting trial authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We estimated treatment effects of individual trials and examined heterogeneity between trials by inspecting forest plots and by quantifying the impact of heterogeneity using the I² statistic. If we detected statistical heterogeneity, we planned to explore possible causes (e.g. differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, outcome assessments).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If we included at least 10 studies in the meta-analysis, we planned to assess publication bias by using the funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>When the participant population and the intervention were almost similar, we considered it appropriate to pool the data. Some studies randomised infants into three groups: DHA alone, DHA plus AA and control formula. We entered outcome data from each of these studies into RevMan as if each consisted of two separate studies (i.e. DHA plus AA vs control and DHA vs control). However, in performing the meta-analysis, we did not pool the data for DHA plus AA versus control and DHA versus control because control group infants were the same for both DHA alone and DHA plus AA groups of infants. We used RevMan 5.3 and applied the fixed-effect model in completing the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes at one year of age: visual acuity (based on VEP); physical growth (weight, length and head circumference); and neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II).</P>
<P>Two review authors (BJ and SR) independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>) to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report evidence quality.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence according to one of four grades.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but may be substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual acuity assessment methods</HEADING>
<P>Visual acuity is a measure of the smallest element that can be resolved and can be assessed in infants with the use of gratings, which consist of black and white stripes or checkerboard patterns. Researchers can measure grating acuity by using behavioural or VEP methods. Each pairing of a black and white stripe is referred to as a cycle, and the spatial frequency of a grating is defined by the number of cycles per degree of viewing angle. As grating spatial frequency increases, the stripes become finer and are more difficult to discriminate, eventually appearing as an even grey to the observer. Grating acuity is the highest spatial frequency at which the stripes can be resolved.</P>
<P>The VEP refers to electrical activity of the brain that is generated in response to a reversing contrast checkerboard or grating. The VEP is recorded from an electrode that is placed over the occipital pole and is classified as transient, steady state or sweep. A transient VEP is elicited by checkerboard reversing from one to three times/s, and a steady-state VEP is elicited by checkerboard reversing from six to 20 times/s. For a sweep VEP, black and white striped grating is used. The amplitude of the VEP increases linearly with spatial frequency near the visual acuity threshold. Linear regression is used to fit a straight line through the linear portion of the VEP amplitude versus the spatial frequency curve, and visual acuity is determined at the intercept of the regression line with the spatial frequency axis. VEP are reported as logMAR (minimum angle of resolution), which corresponds to the smallest black and white check pattern that the infant can discriminate from a grey background (the smaller the value, the better the acuity) or as cycles/degree (the larger the value, the better the acuity).</P>
<P>Behavioural methods for assessing visual acuity rely on the strong preference shown by infants for patterned stimuli over non-patterned stimuli. Both the acuity card procedure (ACP) and the forced preferential looking (FPL) procedure have been used in conjunction with Teller acuity cards to measure the development of visual acuity in infants. The FPL procedure tests binocular grating acuity; the tester views the infant through a peephole, without knowledge of spatial frequency gratings on the cards, and makes a forced-choice judgement about which card the infant prefers. Individual acuities are converted to cycles/degree, and standard deviations (SD) in octaves are determined by dividing one log SD by 0.3.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:24:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from 1889 term infants included in 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) do not demonstrate clear or consistent benefit of supplementing formula with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) for visual acuity, neurodevelopmental outcomes and physical growth in term infants. Our ability to pool study data was limited because of significant conceptual heterogeneity between some included studies. We noted variation among studies regarding type, concentration and duration of supplementation of LCPUFA, as well as in outcomes assessed and methods used to assess outcomes. Some studies measured visual acuity at 1.5, four, six, nine and twelve months and at three years; tested visual acuity by using sweep visual evoked potentials (VEP), steady-state VEP and Teller cards; and assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes at three, four, six, 12 and 18 months, and at two, three, six and nine years. Most studies assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes by using Bayley scores. Some assessed physical growth at four, six and 12 months and at two and three years. Some studies used standard physical measurements like weight (kg), length (cm) and head circumference (cm). Others described z scores for physical measurements.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Birch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> showed benefits of LCPUFA supplementation for Mental Development Index (MDI) scores at 18 months. <LINK REF="STD-Willats-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Willats 1998</LINK> demonstrated that LCPUFA supplementation resulted in better problem-solving skills at 10 months of age. Other RCTs such as <LINK REF="STD-Agostini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 1995,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Auestad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auestad 1997,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Auestad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Auestad 2001,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ben-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ben 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bouwstra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwstra 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1999,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Makrides-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Makrides-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 1999</LINK> have not replicated these beneficial effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Few trials have reported long-term follow-up data. Follow-up data from <LINK REF="STD-Bouwstra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwstra 2005</LINK> showed no beneficial effect of LCPUFA supplementation on neurological function, cognitive development and cardiovascular and anthropometric development at nine years of age (de Jong 2010; de Jong 2012). Follow-up data from <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> revealed higher height and weight-for-age percentiles but not body mass index (BMI) percentiles from birth to six years of age in the LCPUFA supplemented group (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2015</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> showed that LCPUFA supplementation in infancy improved performance on executive function and verbal measures tested at five and six years of age, respectively (Colombo 2013, additional reporting of <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>). The follow-up study to <LINK REF="STD-Willats-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Willats 1998</LINK> showed that IQ scores of children fed a formula containing LCPUFA or no LCPUFA did not differ at the age of six years (<LINK REF="REF-Willatts-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willatts 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various theories have been suggested as reasons for such inconsistent results. <LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 2001</LINK> proposed that a higher dose of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be necessary to achieve beneficial effects. <LINK REF="REF-Uauy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 2003</LINK> proposed that both higher dose and longer duration of LCPUFA supplementation are needed to achieve better outcomes. However, studies that used LCPUFA supplementation until one year of age (<LINK REF="STD-Auestad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Auestad 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Auestad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Auestad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrides-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Makrides 1999</LINK>) failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of LCPUFA supplementation. <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> found beneficial effects of supplementation (0.32% DHA and 0.64% arachidonic acid (AA)) and reported that higher doses of DHA (0.64%, 0.96%) did not confer additional benefit for visual acuity.</P>
<P>In a recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Meldrum-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldrum 2011</LINK>), review authors suggested that sample size, genetic polymorphisms, gender, source of supplement, dose, timing of supplementation, duration of supplementation, compliance with treatment and selection of the test for assessment of neurodevelopmental outcomes may be the factors responsible for inconsistent results.</P>
<P>The Dallas/Kansas group that used LCPUFA derived from single-cell microalgae (<I>Crypthecodinium cohnii</I>: DHA) and fungi (<I>Mortierella alpina</I>: AA) at a DHA concentration of at least 0.32% for one year has shown consistently beneficial effects (<LINK REF="STD-Birch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>). Future RCTs may be needed to consider this approach.</P>
<P>None of the included studies showed significant effects of LCPUFA supplementation on weight, length and head circumference until nine years of age. Results were the same irrespective of type, concentration and duration of LCPUFA supplementation. Even though meta-analysis of pooled data revealed marginally lower weight z scores at one year of age in the LCPUFA supplemented group, these differences were small and are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Greater weight gain during this crucial period may mean higher risk of metabolic syndrome later in life but may be associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes.</P>
<P>The main limitations of our Cochrane review are related to limitations of the included studies such as small sample size, use of variable tools for assessment of visual function and neurodevelopment, different ages of participants at assessment and high attrition rates.</P>
<P>In recent years, various systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of LCPUFA in term neonates. We provide details below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2005</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of 14 RCTs (n = 1846) to examine the effect of LCPUFA supplementation on the growth of term infants. Results showed no significant effect of LCPUFA supplementation on infant weight, length or head circumference at any assessment age.</LI>

<LI>A meta-analysis of individual patient data in <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2009,</LINK> which included 624 infants from two full-term RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bouwstra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bouwstra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1999</LINK>) and 439 infants from two preterm trials, found lack of any effect of LCPUFA supplementation on children's physical growth at 18 months of age.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Beyerlein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beyerlein 2010</LINK> conducted an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of 870 infants from four large RCTs (two preterm RCTs and two term RCTs) of LCPUFA supplementation in formula. For term infants, investigators reported no significant differences in Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) scores at 18 months of age between LCPUFA and control groups (N = 529, mean difference for MDI scores -2.2, 95% CI -4.8 to 0.4; mean difference for PDI scores -1.2, 95% CI -3.3 to 0.9). Study authors concluded that LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula does not have a clinically meaningful effect on neurodevelopment as assessed by Bayley scores at 18 months.</LI>

<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Qawasmi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qawasmi 2012</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (six term and six preterm) to examine the efficacy of LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula for early cognitive development. Researchers found no significant association between LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula and cognitive development at &#8764;one year of age in term infants.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Qawasmi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qawasmi 2013</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (12 term and seven preterm) and concluded that LCPUFA supplementation improves visual acuity up to 12 months of age among term infants. Study authors extracted the mean visual acuity and standard deviation (SD) values from figures if not reported in text or tables, and this may not have been a reliable approach. Other limitations of this meta-analysis have been described in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), prepared by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0053686/; accessed 20 December 2016).</LI>

<LINK REF="REF-Jiao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiao 2014</LINK> evaluated the role of DHA in cognitive function among infants, children and adults by conducting an extensive systematic review. Study authors reported that 'the age of participants throughout all of the trials ranged from birth to 86 years, which covers nearly the entire scale of the human life span'. They found that DHA supplements improved Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Mental Development Index (MDI) scores among infants, but included studies (n = 7) differed in their inclusion criteria, with ages of enrolled infants ranging from birth to nine months.</LI>

<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2015</LINK> evaluated the validity and reliability of neurocognitive endpoints used in DHA and AA infant formula supplementation trials. Study authors included RCTs from both preterm and full-term infant populations. They concluded that available data are currently inadequate to conclude that DHA/AA supplementation has a clinically meaningful beneficial effect on neurological development. They brought into sharp focus the limitations of tools used currently for neurocognitive assessment and stressed the need for development and use of well-defined, valid and reliable outcome measures for use in future clinical trials.</LI>

<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Quin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quin 2016</LINK> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and semi-RCTs of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during prenatal and postnatal periods. Review authors reported that n-3 PUFA supplementation for infants delivered maternally or directly through formula does not improve visual acuity, language development or cognition. They also reported that n-3 PUFA supplements affect infant immune development and reduce pro-inflammatory responses among supplemented breast-fed and fortified formula-fed/directly supplemented infants. They concluded that overall, evidence does not support continued supplementation of infant formula with long chain n-3 PUFA, in light of its negative impact on development of immune responses.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Overall, the results of the other systematic reviews on this topic are similar to those of our Cochrane review, which found no significant benefits of LCPUFA supplementation of formula milk for term infants.</P>
<P>However, recommendations/opinions as to whether infant formula should be supplemented with LCPUFA have varied. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA; <LINK REF="REF-EFSA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFSA 2014</LINK>) recently recommended that "there is no necessity to add ARA to infant and follow-on formulae". This group recommended that "DHA should be added to infant formulae and follow-on formulae, even though there is currently no conclusive evidence for any effects beyond infancy of addition of DHA to infant formula on any of the health outcomes studied". The opinion of the EFSA is shared by some experts in the field (<LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 2015</LINK>), but other experts have warned that the EFSA recommendation for not providing AA supplementation for infant formula puts infants at risk and should be revised (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsyth-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsyth 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>In effect, the same currently available evidence has yielded three different opinions/recommendations: One group believes that infant formula needs to be supplemented with DHA but not with AA (<LINK REF="REF-EFSA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFSA 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauritzen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritzen 2015</LINK>); another group believes that it is 'dangerous not to add ARA, especially in the presence of DHA' (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsyth-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsyth 2015</LINK>); and many systematic reviews along with this Cochrane review have found no consistent benefit of DHA or AA supplementation for term infants, although the overall quality of evidence was low. This means that the controversial issue of LCPUFA supplementation of formula milk for term infants has not yet been resolved. Well-conducted RCTs with adequate sample size and reliable and consistent endpoints are essential to address this issue definitively. Until this is done, routine and compulsory LCPUFA supplementation for formula-fed term infants cannot be recommended.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-02 00:05:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of bias of studies was assessed by two review authors (SR and BJ). We resolved disagreements by discussion among all four review authors and by consensus. We entered information into the Risk of bias table using the following criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Was there adequate sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias):</B> The method used to generate the allocation sequence in each included study was described as low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table, computer random number generator); high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Was there adequate allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias):</B> The method used to conceal the allocation sequence in each included study was described as: low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Was there adequate blinding (checking for possible performance bias):</B> The methods used to blind personnel from knowledge of which intervention participants received. Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At the time of outcome assessment? Categorised as low risk, high risk or unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Were incomplete outcome data addressed (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations):</B> If attrition and exclusion were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes were reported. We assessed methods as low risk (&lt; 20% missing data); high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Was there selective reporting bias:</B> The possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was investigated. We assessed methods as low risk (when it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes were reported); high risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Were there any other sources of potential bias:</B> Any important concerns about other potential sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process) were described. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as low risk; high risk; unclear risk.</P>
