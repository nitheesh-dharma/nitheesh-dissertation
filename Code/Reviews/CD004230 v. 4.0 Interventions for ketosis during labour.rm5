<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-04 14:28:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Physical stress compounded by reduced food intake during labour can lead to raised levels of ketones in the blood and urine (ketosis). Ketone bodies transport fat-derived energy from the liver to other organs to provide an alternative source of energy. They also cross the placenta and the effect of ketosis on mother and baby is not clear. It is not clear whether ketosis during labour is a normal physiological response, or if women with ketosis in labour require intervention (such as intravenous and oral fluids). This uncertainty has resulted in differences in opinion and practice. Adverse effects of ketosis for the mother include increased likelihood of augmentation of labour, forceps-assisted delivery and postpartum blood loss.</P>
<P>Yet intravenous therapies can have adverse effects, either by interfering with glucose and insulin levels for the mother and infant (causing neonatal hypoglycaemia) or lowering sodium level, for example. Other reported adverse effects include headache, nausea, maternal fluid overload, slowing of labour and difficulty in establishment of breastfeeding, as well as local pain and discomfort and interference with the woman's freedom of movement in labour. The newborn may have acidic blood and increased lactate levels.</P>
<P>This review found no information on which to base practice in the treatment of women with ketosis during labour. The authors looked for studies comparing oral intake or intravenous fluids with no intervention (defined as no oral intake, ice chips only or oral intake on demand) and pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>The only six studies identified focussed on maternal biochemical measures during or shortly after labour and could not be included in the review. The studies were conducted in the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Future trials should examine the use of different types of intravenous and oral fluids on clinically important outcomes and include women's perception and satisfaction with care during labour and birth.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In labour, ketosis (the elevation of ketone bodies in the blood) is a common occurrence, due to increased physical stress, which is often compounded by reduced oral intake. The effect of ketosis on the mother and baby during labour is not clear, therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether ketosis is a normal physiological response or whether women with ketosis in labour require intervention (such as intravenous fluids or increased oral intake) for maternal and infant wellbeing. This uncertainty has resulted in differences in opinion and practice by those providing care for women in labour.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-09 09:07:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-04 14:28:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Under normal conditions the body utilises glycogen, which is stored in the liver, for energy. When glycogen stores are depleted, the liver metabolises fat, giving rise to ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are molecules which transport fat-derived energy from the liver to other organs and are normally oxidised to carbon dioxide, water and usable energy by peripheral tissue. However, when placed under more severe conditions, for example, starvation and excessive exercise, peripheral metabolic processes cannot cope and ketones accumulate in the blood. This state is known as ketosis and usually becomes evident by the presence of ketone bodies in the urine (ketonuria). When ketosis occurs, the body also utilises ketone bodies as readily available alternative energy. Therefore, under normal circumstances, ketonuria is thought to indicate the success of the body's physiologically protective response of using alternative energy sources in times of increased energy requirements and indicates a need for increased caloric intake (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kubli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubli 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The gradual fall in glucose levels and increase in free fatty acids occurring in pregnancy results in an increased likelihood of ketosis (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>). In labour, ketosis is a common occurrence, due to the increased physical stress and often compounded by reduced oral intake (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goer 1995</LINK>). Although desire for food naturally tapers off during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Ludka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludka 1993</LINK>), routine policies in many maternity units of withholding or restricting oral intake in labour is thought to make a significant contribution to the increased risk of ketosis. This practice was first introduced in the late 1940s to reduce the risk of anaesthetic related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988</LINK>) and its role in the care of women in labour in modern care settings has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goer 1995</LINK>). The effect of restricting oral food and fluid during labour is beyond the scope of this review but is the focus of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Singata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singata 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical importance of detecting ketosis in labour is not clear. Many believe that it represents a normal physiological response without adverse effects to the woman or baby (<LINK REF="REF-Keppler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keppler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 2000</LINK>). The association between marked ketonuria and prolonged labour is well known. However, which is the cause and which is the effect remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazle 1986</LINK>). A higher incidence of ketosis has also been described for nulliparous women (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>). Adverse effects include increased likelihood of augmentation of labour, forceps-assisted delivery and postpartum blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>). Although ketones do cross the placenta, effects on the fetus are unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>). However, reduced glucose levels in the mother have been shown to affect fetal breathing and general fetal activity (<LINK REF="REF-Ludka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludka 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ketonuria is usually detected by a simple bedside urine test using firm plastic strips to which are affixed reagent areas (Ketostix/Multistix) (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludka 1993</LINK>). However, a high false positive rate has been reported which may increase the risk of unnecessary intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludka 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the presence of ketonuria for well women is now generally accepted as a normal physiological response to labour which is often managed conservatively, variation in practice exists. Management strategies may include administration of intravenous fluids; encouraging oral intake of food and fluids (including high calorie preparations), and no intervention. This lack of consistency reflects the lack of reliable evidence for management strategies combined with limited understanding of the normal biochemistry of labouring women (<LINK REF="REF-Goer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goer 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects of additional oral intake during labour include nausea and vomiting in labour and the immediate postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Kubli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubli 2002</LINK>) and, although extremely rare, aspiration of gastric contents when general anaesthesia is used (Mendelson's Syndrome) (<LINK REF="REF-Scheepers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheepers 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most commonly used intravenous therapy solutions are crystalloid based fluids of dextrose/glucose, normal saline and balanced salt solutions or Hartmann's (compound sodium lactate) (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasserstrum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasserstrum 1992</LINK>). The use of intravenous therapy for women in labour is however, not without adverse effects. The use of large quantities and volumes of intravenous glucose (greater than 25 g glucose) in labouring women can lead to maternal hyperglycaemia and iatrogenic hyperinsulinism in the fetus, as well as subsequent postnatal hypoglycaemia and jaundice (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazle 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>). Another potential hazard of excessive administration of salt-free intravenous solutions in labour is acute dilutional hyponatraemia in both the mother and neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keppler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keppler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasserstrum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasserstrum 1992</LINK>). Other reported adverse effects include decreased fetal blood pH and increased fetal lactate, headache, nausea, maternal fluid overload, slowing of labour and difficulty in establishment of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1988</LINK>). The use of intravenous therapy may also result in local pain and discomfort and reduces the woman's freedom of movement in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Broach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broach 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review will address the risks and benefits of treatment of women with ketosis in labour.</P>

<P>Standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group were used as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). The review authors worked independently in undertaking the assessment of potentially eligible trials for inclusion. Authors of four studies were contacted for additional information on methods and outcome data to enable assessment of eligibility for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ames-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Ames 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Inman 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1985</LINK>). However, at the time of this review, no information was received. Therefore, no studies are included in this review.</P>
<P>If we identify studies for inclusion in the future, we will use the following methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>We will assess for inclusion all potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, consult an outside person.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>We will assess the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). We will describe methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence for each trial.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>(1) Selection bias (allocation concealment)</B>
</I>
<BR/>We will assign a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</B>
</I>
<BR/>We will assess completeness to follow up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.<BR/>
<I>
<B>
<BR/>(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment) </B>
</I>
<BR/>We will assess blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>We will design a form to extract data. At least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion. We will use the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter all the data or a sub-sample.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials are sufficiently similar.</P>

<BR/>For continuous data, we will use the weighted mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. If there is evidence of skewness, this will be reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Available case analysis </B>
<BR/>We will analyse data on all participants with available data in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants are not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there is sufficient information in the trial report, we will attempt to restore them to the correct group.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>We will apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. If we identify high levels of heterogeneity among the trials, (exceeding 50%), we will explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis and perform sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis will be used as an overall summary if this is considered appropriate.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
<BR/>We will conduct planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out subgroup analyses according to different types of oral and intravenous solutions as follows:<BR/>(i) intravenous therapy solutions i.e: glucose solutions; balanced salt solutions i.e Hartmanns; normal saline.<BR/>(ii) high carbohydrate oral fluids.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-04 14:28:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>The purpose of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of additional oral intake or intravenous fluids, or both, given to women for the treatment of ketosis during labour. We identified four small studies involving 168 women (<LINK REF="STD-Ames-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Ames 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Inman 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 1985</LINK>) as potentially eligible for inclusion in this review. However, we were unable to include any of these studies due to inadequate reporting of the outcome measures prespecified for this review. Although we have requested additional information from authors, at the time of this review we have received no responses. As these studies were conducted some time ago (late 1970s to mid-1980s) it is unlikely that the required additional information will be forthcoming.</P>
<P>All four studies identified as potentially eligible for the review tested the effect of intravenous fluids given to women diagnosed with ketosis in the first stage of labour. All studies compared a range of substrates. Outcome measures focussed on maternal biochemical measures during or shortly after labour and birth. Clinically meaningful outcomes for mother and infant were not reported. However, from the limited available data from these studies, it would appear that the use of hypertonic solutions (e.g. 5%, 10% and 50% glucose and Hartmann's solution) has short-term adverse effects on the maternal and fetal biochemical markers when compared with normal saline alone. Investigators reported increased incidence of lactic acidosis and maternal hyperglycaemia associated with such solutions. The effect of intravenous therapy on clinically important outcomes (such as fetal distress and neonatal hypoglycaemia) cannot be assessed based on the available information. No trials were identified which addressed the effect of additional oral fluids for women with ketosis in labour, compared with oral intake on demand or no intake or ice chips only.</P>
<P>The clinical importance of detecting ketosis and treating women with ketosis in labour is not clear. Under normal circumstances, ketonuria is thought to indicate a normal physiological response to episodes of increased energy requirements and indicates a need for increased caloric intake. In labour, ketosis is not an uncommon occurrence due to the increased physical stress which is often compounded by reduced oral intake. A reduction in oral intake may be driven by the woman herself (desire for food naturally tapering off), or routine policies in many maternity units of withholding or restricting oral intake in labour, or both. The practice of withholding food and fluids was first introduced in the late 1940s to reduce the risk of anaesthetic related complications, and its role in the care of women in labour in modern care settings has been questioned. Further research is required to more clearly identify the association between ketosis in labour and adverse pregnancy outcome.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review does not provide information to guide practice in the treatment of women with ketosis in labour. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-04-04 14:29:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja Henderson">
<P>Further research is required to assess the association of ketonuria and adverse outcomes, such as length of labour, operative vaginal delivery rates, caesarean section rates, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal outcomes. Future trials should examine the use of different types of intravenous and oral fluids on clinically important outcomes, and include women's perception and satisfaction with care during labour and birth.</P>
