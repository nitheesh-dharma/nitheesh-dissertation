<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence to support or refute elective surgery for benign liver tumours</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The most common benign liver tumours include cavernous haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, and no treatment is indicated. The natural history of haemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia is typically uneventful whereas that of hepatic adenoma can be complicated by life-threatening conditions, such as rupture and haemorrhage. For these complications or when a definite histologic diagnosis is needed, surgery is advisable. However, in clinical practice there is a wide variation concerning the use of elective surgery (ie, surgery performed before complications have developed). No randomised clinical trials were identified for this systematic review, but 31 case series without a proper control group were retrieved. Accordingly, there is no evidence to support or refute elective surgery for benign liver tumours.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Benign liver tumours (haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma) have different prevalence and prognosis. Spontaneous rupture and malignant transformation can complicate hepatic adenoma. Elective surgery is controversial, and indications are represented by uncertain diagnosis, presence of symptoms, and prevention of major complications. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of elective surgery of benign liver tumours. We identified 31 cases series. These were small (with less than 60 participants) and the types of tumours mixed. These studies reported no significant mortality, but in the six studies with mortality it ranged from 1% to 17%.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 23:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The widespread use of diagnostic imaging methods of the liver has led to the frequent and incidental detection of focal lesions for which invasive, costly, and time-consuming investigations and/or follow-up are required in order to prove their benign nature (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brancatelli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brancatelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>). These benign liver tumours are classified as haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma (<LINK REF="REF-Ishak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishak 2001</LINK>). Their actual prevalence remains to be defined. Scattered data are up to now available: in unselected autoptic series the frequency of haemangioma ranges from 3% to 20% and that of focal nodular hyperplasia from 0.4% to 0.8%. Present data concerning hepatic adenoma indicate this tumour is very rare (<LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The natural history of both haemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia is typically long-lasting and uneventful (<LINK REF="REF-Gandolfi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandolfi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathieu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathieu 2000</LINK>). On the contrary, hepatic adenoma may be complicated by life-threatening conditions such as rupture, haemorrhage, and malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gyorffy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyorffy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The correct therapeutic approach to these benign tumours represents a challenge. The wide variation in clinical practice mainly concerns the role of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Weimann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weimann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belghiti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghiti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charny-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charny 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>). The common indications for surgery include uncertain diagnosis (possible malignant transformation), presence of symptoms related to tumour size, and risk of rupture and haemorrhage. For hepatic adenoma, resection is advocated due to the high risk of haemorrhage and possible malignant transformation probably unrelated to the tumour size itself (<LINK REF="REF-Weimann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weimann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belghiti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghiti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathieu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathieu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charny-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charny 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>). As the alternative approach to surgery is represented by long-term clinical observation, the role of surgery remains to be clearly defined and deserves a careful analysis. </P>
<P>We have been unable to identify any meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the elective surgery for benign liver tumours. As we could not find any randomised clinical trials, we could not follow the protocol in full while preparing the present review. If, in the future, randomised clinical trials are identified for inclusion, the text in the protocol part will logically be changed. </P>

<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>The statistical package (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) was to be used. Dichotomous data were to be presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous outcome measures by weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CI. All analyses were to be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, which means that participants in the trials should have been analysed in the groups in which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received or adhered to the allocated intervention. We intended to compute a 'reported scenario' analysis. However, we planned to place most weight on the 'likely scenario' analysis. Intervention effects were to be analysed by using both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, only the result of the fixed-effect model analysis would have been given. In case of significant discrepancies of the two models, results from both models were to be reported and discussed. The presence of statistical heterogeneity was to be explored by the chi-squared test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10. In case of significant heterogeneity, the possible source of heterogeneity was to be explored by sensitivity analyses. The level of significance is set at P &lt; 0.05.<BR/>

<P>No randomised clinical trials were found. </P>
<P>Thirty-one surgical series were found to be dealing with patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the present review. The results of these studies, in terms of number of patients enrolled (PTS), type of tumour (H, FNH, A), number of patients operated (surgery/total, S/T %), the number of tumours observed who do not undergo surgical resection and were followed up (observed /total, O/T, %), surgical mortality (SM, %), and spontaneous rupture (SR, %) are summarized in the <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Most case series were small with less than 60 patients (range 5 to 411 patients). The types of tumours were mixed. Most studies reported no surgical mortality, but in the six studies with mortality, it ranged from 1% to 17%.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The lack of randomised clinical trials assessing the beneficial or harmful effects of elective surgical resection in the management of benign liver tumours was not unexpected. Both the limited quality and the paucity of surgical randomised clinical trials is a well-known fact: treatments in general surgery are half as likely to be based on evidence from randomised clinical trials as treatments in internal medicine, and randomised clinical trials account for less than 10% of the total of surgical studies (<LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>It could even be more difficult to perform randomised clinical trials when surgical and non-surgical (eg, medical follow-up) procedures are compared due to possible lack of patients' equipoise. On the other hand, as the possible benefits of elective surgery for benign liver tumours are not obvious, a comparison between elective surgery versus long-term clinical observation could have been both advisable and ethical. Obviously, no randomised clinical trials should be directed to find the best management of acute complications of benign liver tumours (eg, haemorrhage and rupture). These life-threatening complications, however, affect only a minority of patients with hepatic adenoma whereas the natural history of both hepatic haemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia is typically uneventful (<LINK REF="REF-Gandolfi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gandolfi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 2001</LINK>) .</P>
<P>As concerns hepatic adenoma, the possible role for elective surgery mainly depends upon the risk of complication/s, but data concerning its actual incidence are presently lacking. In fact, both selection and spectrum bias negatively affect the retrospective surgical case series that represent most of the available literature on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerlin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kerlin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gugenheim-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gugenheim 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iwatsuki-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Iwatsuki 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leese-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Leese 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamagata-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Yamagata 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belli-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Belli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lise-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lise 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paineau-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Paineau 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cherqui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cherqui 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farges-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Farges 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagorney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagorney 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egea-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Egea 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouwers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weiman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arnoletti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arnoletti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Closset-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Closset 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leconte-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leconte 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ozden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charny-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charny 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popescu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Popescu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Descottes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Descottes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). In addition, these type of studies can actually overestimate both the rate of complications and the surgical benefits. Moreover, concerning the two other common indications for surgery, represented by the uncertainty of diagnosis and the presence of symptoms related to tumour size, the role of surgery can be challenged. In fact, the continuous improvement in diagnostic techniques, particularly magnetic resonance, has the consequence that one can restrict surgical resection to very few participants, mainly represented by non-classic or mixed hyperplastic adenomatous forms of focal nodular hyperplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Reddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 2001</LINK>) for which the procedure has not only a curative target, but also the need for a precise pathologic definition. Also the role of surgery for symptomatic tumours has been claimed only by small uncontrolled case series; moreover the correlation between aspecific symptoms, such as pain, dyspepsia, cough (<LINK REF="STD-Gugenheim-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gugenheim 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iwatsuki-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Iwatsuki 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belli-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Belli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lise-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lise 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagorney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nagorney 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popescu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Popescu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>), and the tumour size can be regarded as doubtful as persistence of symptoms is often reported. Thus, the potential benefits and harms of elective surgical resection for benign liver tumours should be assessed in adequate randomised clinical trials, comparing surgery with long-term clinical observation, as the matter seems to be of both ethical and clinical relevance.</P>
<P>The most important obstacle probably preventing these trials is the rarity of hepatic adenoma and the low incidence of hepatic adenoma-related acute complications, which remains to be defined and is probably lower than described. As a consequence, a large multicenter randomised clinical trial should be necessary to reach an adequate sample size. In fact, rare conditions, such as hepatic adenoma, are regarded as difficult to investigate, especially when an accrual of patients takes over two years (<LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2002</LINK>). These difficulties could be reduced assessing well-defined subgroups, characterized by a higher risk of complications, such as for instance the tumour size. In fact, only adenomas larger than 5 cm showed rupture and haemorrhage in the retrieved surgical series (<LINK REF="REF-De-Wilt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Wilt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>). A further subgroup of hepatic adenoma at higher risk for malignancy could be identified using molecular genotype classification as recently reported (<LINK REF="STD-Terkivatan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Terkivatan 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The unavailability of clear evidence from randomised trials makes it difficult to define a rational approach. The need for solid evidence in this field is further supported by the continuously increasing detection rate of benign liver lesions, based on the widespread use of diagnostic imaging techniques. </P>
<P>When considering a single patient with a focal liver lesion with a presumptive benign nature, the following variables seems to be of relevance: the accuracy of imaging techniques for the differential diagnosis of liver adenoma, the incidence of tumour acute complications, the mortality rate after elective surgery, the mortality rate for acute tumour complications and after emergency surgery. Overall, the available data are scanty and of poor quality. In fact, most of the studies are retrospective surgical series that are inadequate to correctly estimate both the spontaneous incidence of tumour complications and the rate of surgical-related outcomes (ie, mortality and morbidity). In addition, as is the case of studies assessing diagnostic accuracy, samples are usually small, selection, spectrum and work-up biases are common, and the different imaging techniques are not always directly compared. </P>
<P>In conclusion, no evidence is currently available to support the indication for elective surgery in patients with focal liver lesion(s) incidentally detected and supposed to be benign: not only no randomised trials assessing this question were found, but data concerning the natural history of these tumours, particularly the incidence of acute complications, are scanty and biased. Consequently, long-term clinical observation could represent an adequate choice. Further studies obtaining a better definition of subgroups with different complication rate are needed. </P>

<P>Given the lack of evidences to support the indication for elective surgery in patient with focal liver lesion incidentally detected and supposed to be benign, elective surgery should be compared with clinical observation in randomised clinical trials with adequate sample size and long-term follow-up. Further trials obtaining a better definition of subgroups with different complication rate are also needed. Such trials should properly be stratified for tumour type and tumour size, and be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org).</P>
