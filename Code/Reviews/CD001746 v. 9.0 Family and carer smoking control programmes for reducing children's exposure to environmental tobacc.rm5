All mechanisms for reducing children's ETS exposure were eligible, including smoking prevention, cessation, and control programmes. These include health promotion, social-behavioural therapies, technology, education, and clinical interventions.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-01-23 11:25:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Two review authors independently assessed studies and extracted data.

We judged nine studies to be at low risk of bias, 35 to have unclear overall risk of bias, and 34 to have high risk of bias. Twenty-one interventions targeted populations or community settings, 27 studies were conducted in the well-child healthcare setting and 26 in the ill-child healthcare setting. Two further studies conducted in paediatric clinics did not make clear whether visits were made to well- or ill-children, and another included visits to both well- and ill-children. Forty-five studies were reported from North America, 22 from other high-income countries, and 11 from low- or middle-income countries. Only 26 of the 78 studies reported a beneficial intervention effect for reduction of child ETS exposure, 24 of which were statistically significant. Of these 24 studies, 13 used objective measures of children's ETS exposure. We were unable to pinpoint what made these programmes effective. Studies showing a significant effect used a range of interventions: nine used in-person counselling or motivational interviewing; another study used telephone counselling, and one used a combination of in-person and telephone counselling; three used multi-component counselling-based interventions; two used multi-component education-based interventions; one used a school-based strategy; four used educational interventions, including one that used picture books; one used a smoking cessation intervention; one used a brief intervention; and another did not describe the intervention. Of the 52 studies that did not show a significant reduction in child ETS exposure, 19 used more intensive counselling approaches, including motivational interviewing, education, coaching, and smoking cessation brief advice. Other interventions consisted of brief advice or counselling (10 studies), feedback of a biological measure of children's ETS exposure (six studies), nicotine replacement therapy (two studies), feedback of maternal cotinine (one study), computerised risk assessment (one study), telephone smoking cessation support (two studies), educational home visits (eight studies), group sessions (one study), educational materials (three studies), and school-based policy and health promotion (one study). Some studies employed more than one intervention. 35 of the 78 studies reported a reduction in ETS exposure for children, irrespective of assignment to intervention and comparison groups. One study did not aim to reduce children's tobacco smoke exposure but rather sought to reduce symptoms of asthma, and found a significant reduction in symptoms among the group exposed to motivational interviewing. We found little evidence of difference in effectiveness of interventions between the well infant, child respiratory illness, and other child illness settings as contexts for parental smoking cessation interventions.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-30 08:46:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>A minority of interventions have been shown to reduce children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and improve children's health, but the features that differentiate the effective interventions from those without clear evidence of effectiveness remain unclear. The evidence was judged to be of low or very low quality, as many of the trials are at a high risk of bias, are small and inadequately powered, with heterogeneous interventions and populations. <BR/></P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-30 08:49:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-29 11:57:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Active smoking has been recognised as harmful to the smoker for over six decades, since the landmark Doll and Hill publication (<LINK REF="REF-Doll-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 1950</LINK>), but it was not until 1974 that the medical literature first discussed parental smoking, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and the effects of ETS on children (<LINK REF="REF-Harlap-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlap 1974</LINK>). Overwhelming evidence indicates that parental smoking is associated with a range of adverse health effects for children (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1997</LINK>). Perhaps its most obvious association is with increased risk, increased severity, and greater likelihood of admission to hospital of children with lower and upper respiratory tract disease (<LINK REF="REF-Strachan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strachan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strachan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strachan 1998</LINK>, respectively). An increasing body of evidence describes an association between parental smoking and increased risk of serious bacterial infections such as meningitis among children (<LINK REF="REF-Iles-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iles 2001</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Lam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2001</LINK> reported that ETS exposure increases health service use and costs, and <LINK REF="REF-Chiswell-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiswell 2017</LINK> described associated poorer surgical outcomes.</P><P>Furthermore, parental smoking confers a significantly increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1997</LINK>). This effect is present regardless of which parent is the smoker (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 1999</LINK>), and it is the strongest modifiable risk factor for SIDS. In addition, research across several continents over the last two decades has found that children of smokers have an increased risk of uptake in adolescence, perhaps as a result of role modelling and/or increased access to cigarettes (<LINK REF="REF-Mays-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mays 2014</LINK>). There is also an increased risk of respiratory symptoms persisting into adulthood among children exposed to ETS from their parents or carers, but who do not themselves take up smoking later in life (<LINK REF="REF-Pugmire-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugmire 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Parental smoking is a common but preventable source of infant and childhood morbidity. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the need to reduce parental smoking as a key element of action to encourage health and development in early childhood, particularly among those living in difficult social and economic circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). In some countries, strong relationships between socioeconomic status and environmental quality are evident (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>), and strategies to reduce smoking and improve child health outcomes must be underpinned by recognition of finite resources and the limited control that some individuals and families have over environmental and social situations.</P><P>Infants' and toddlers' exposure to smoking occurs primarily within the home environment, as this is where they spend most of their time. Older children may also be exposed to smoking in a variety of child care and educational settings in which they spend their time. As children increase their time spent in commercial and informal child care settings, the importance of child care workers' behaviours increases. Similarly, environments in which young children are exposed extend beyond the home and include shopping centres, meeting places, and other social environments.</P><P>Tobacco cessation strategies and interventions to reduce ETS have had mixed success, often providing small benefits on an individual level (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2014</LINK>). Systematic reviews have previously demonstrated that individual counselling increases cessation rates (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2017</LINK>), and that simple advice from a physician may have a positive effect in triggering quit attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013</LINK>). In relation to children's exposure in utero and during the early years, smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women can be effective in reducing smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2017</LINK>). Although smoke-free legislation in England has contributed to the 79% reduction in children&#8217;s ETS exposure since 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 2015</LINK>), variability is ongoing, and children in families from lower socioeconomic status remain at greater risk of ETS exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Globally, 80% of the world's smokers live in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>), which have demonstrated less political will to enforce smoke-free legislation (<LINK REF="REF-Pugmire-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugmire 2017</LINK>).</P></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-23 12:29:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-29 11:57:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-23 12:41:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-09 09:27:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Controlled trials with or without random allocation.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-01-23 12:29:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>People (parents and other family members, child care workers, and teachers) involved in the care and education of infants and young children (from birth to 12 years of age).</P></CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-23 12:33:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>We included all mechanisms for the reduction of children's ETS exposure, including smoking prevention, smoking cessation, and any other tobacco control programmes targeting the participants described above.

For example, in clinical situations where a clinician is the interviewer, social bias may influence the report towards the socially desired response.</P><P>Researchers and clinicians often prefer to use levels of nicotine or its breakdown products, by contrast, as a measure of real reductions in smoking or ETS. Cotinine is a metabolic breakdown product of nicotine with a half-life of about one day (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1983</LINK>). Its half-life is longer in non-smokers such as infants and young children (<LINK REF="REF-Idle-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idle 1990</LINK>).

In June 2011, we conducted a search for articles from 2007 to 2011. The Trial Search Co-ordinator searched the CochraneTobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register. We conducted the most recent search in February 2017.</P><P>We obtained and reviewed reports of all references identified as possibly describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials (CTs), and we checked the reference lists of all identified RCTs and CTs to identify potentially relevant citations. We made enquiries regarding other known published and unpublished studies so that we could include these results in our review.</P><P>We have presented search strategies for the key databases in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> (MEDLINE); <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> (Embase); <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> (CINAHL); <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> (PsycINFO); <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> (ERIC); and <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> (the Cochrane Library).</P></SEARCH_METHODS><DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-01-29 11:57:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two review authors (BB and MS) independently screened studies for inclusion using <LINK REF="REF-Covidence" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covidence</LINK>. Three review authors independently undertook assessment of quality and extraction of included study details and results. For this update, BB reviewed all studies; and MS, RB, and RR each reviewed one-third of the studies and compared results. We created a data extraction spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel.</P><P>We extracted information on methods, participants, intervention and control conditions, and outcomes. We were particularly interested in aspects of intervention development that may have contributed to a stronger, more appropriate or sustained intervention. We extracted information on the theory underlying the intervention development and content, process indicators and descriptions of community consultation and/or participation in the planning and implementation of the intervention, incentives (if present), and concerns regarding intervention programmes. We also recorded any information about costs, either in terms of evaluations of cost-effectiveness, or simply where costs were mentioned. Where possible, we examined outcomes by gender, age, and socioeconomic status.</P><P>We resolved differences between reviewers' screening and extraction results by discussion or by consultation with a third review author. Given the heterogeneity of study design and characteristics, we considered a quantitative estimate of effect to be inappropriate and therefore provided a narrative synthesis.</P><QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-29 11:57:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for all included studies, including those included in previous versions of this review.

It is possible for outcome assessors to be blinded to group allocation and we have noted where there was partial blinding.

Length of follow-up is important to determine, as it affects the extent to which sustainability and long-term outcomes can be assessed.

Although the proportion of studies targeting the population or community level has increased since review authors conducted the previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Baxi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxi 2014</LINK>), most studies that detected an effect (15) were performed in clinical settings (eight well-child; five ill-child; two well- and ill-child), with eight successful interventions delivered in community settings and one in an unspecified setting. The intervention most frequently used in 16 of the 24 successful studies was counselling, two instances of which were provided in combination with education and feedback on measures of exposure.

Brief advice for adult smokers when they attend clinical services for their health has a positive effect in triggering quit attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013</LINK>). Trials of interventions for parents attending clinical paediatric or child health services did not detect this effect. However, this finding might suggest that either a different sort of brief intervention should be employed, or that this context should not be used for brief advice. Also, studies may have been underpowered to detect a small effect. Examination of the dynamics of the doctor-child-parent relationship may assist the development of brief strategies with a greater likelihood of success in this clinical setting. Given the unknowns about the doctor-child-parent interaction, interventions provided in this setting may potentially cause harm. One study reported a trend for mothers in the intervention group to smoke more than mothers in the control group after receiving the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1999</LINK>). Several studies used only one-tailed t-tests to look for statistical significance.

The odds favouring the longest quit attempt were significantly increased when participants had made a 24-hour quit attempt in the year prior to baseline, had tried a greater number of methods to quit in the past, and had reduced permissiveness of home smoking. Researchers did not find significant associations between longer quit attempts and level of education, heaviness of smoking or the smoking status of a partner.</P><P>There are relatively high rates of smoking cessation in pregnancy, both spontaneously and with clinical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2015</LINK>). With high postnatal relapse rates reported among women who have quit during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lelong-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lelong 2001</LINK>), prevention of relapse for this group is an obvious means of preventing environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure for their children. <LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van_x0027_t-Hof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van't Hof 2000</LINK> identified risk factors for relapse. Risk factors identified by <LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2001</LINK> included having a partner who smoked and smoking a greater number of sticks per day before quitting; data show that prolonged breast feeding and higher scores on a scale measuring mental health were protective. <LINK REF="STD-Van_x0027_t-Hof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van't Hof 2000</LINK> found that a lower level of confidence in maintaining cessation, a lower level of encouragement by family and friends to maintain cessation, and greater numbers of family and friends who smoked were all associated with significantly higher odds of postpartum relapse. Further work in this area will make an important contribution.</P><P>Many of the studies identified for this review demonstrated reduced child exposure to ETS among participants, regardless of assignment to intervention or control groups, which suggests that studies may be describing the natural history of smoking among parents. Parents may reduce their own smoking or their children's exposure over time, possibly as a result of social pressures. Indeed the prevalent social trend in many developed countries over the past decade has been increased community concern about exposing non-smokers to ETS (although arguably more so among non-smokers than among active smokers). This is especially true for adults in the workplace and in public spaces such as bars and restaurants, particularly in North America, Australia, and some countries within the EU, where total smoking bans for these settings are increasingly legislated. Campaigns and community concerns about children's exposure to ETS at home and in cars have also increased. It is possible that these studies have recorded parents responding to this social trend by limiting their children's exposure in the home. This being the case, studies need to aim not just for a reduction in children's ETS exposure, but for a greater than background reduction in ETS exposure. For a study to produce a significant effect, the impact of interventions must be greater than the rate of decline in comparison groups. It may be true that as most studies used comparison groups rather than control groups (i.e. no cessation or avoidance advice and no information), the comparison interventions may have been more effective than anticipated. As studies have generally involved comparison groups receiving a limited intervention rather than strict control groups, this is certainly possible. Moreover, measurement of tobacco smoke exposure outcomes alone may produce an intervention effect and thus may be an important component of any intervention.</P><P>We judged the inconclusive evidence presented in this review to be of low or very low quality, despite the fact that this review includes 78 studies (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Limitations include risk of bias, heterogeneity among study interventions and populations, and small sample sizes with low statistical power. Continuing to perform studies without adequate sample size, quality, or comparable interventions and populations will not allow for any conclusions to be reached regarding the clinical effects or cost-effectiveness of interventions. Moreover, additional low-quality studies may be an unethical use of resources and participants&#8217; time.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of methods employed</HEADING><P>The heterogeneity of study designs and characteristics rendered quantitative analysis inappropriate for this review. However, there is currently no best approach in narrative, rather than quantitative, syntheses of published studies. As we have included 78 studies, it would not be feasible to list results of each in the main text. Therefore, we have highlighted key results in our narrative summary and have recorded further results data in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. However, we are aware that in some places, this means that studies with statistically significant results have been described in greater detail in the text than those that did not detect an effect. We have attempted to mitigate any impact of this by explicitly describing studies that tested similar interventions but did not detect an effect.</P><P>An additional limitation is that, of the 20 studies that used objective measures of children's ETS exposure or absorption, only four showed no discrepancy between parental reports of children's exposure and the biological measures. As most studies did not use objective measures, this calls into question the validity of self-reported data provided in this review.</P><P>As noted above, many of the included studies had small sample sizes, and fewer than half (N = 28) reported a power calculation. For studies that did not detect an effect, this makes it difficult to establish whether the intervention was genuinely not effective, or if a result was not detected because the sample size was too small.</P><P>Included studies reported varying lengths of follow-up. We used the longest reported follow-up for the results. However, some studies reported short lengths of follow-up, with 20 studies reporting follow-up of less than six months. It is difficult to determine the sustainability and long-term effectiveness of interventions when study follow-up is short. Indeed, of the studies reporting longer follow-up, some did show an initial difference between intervention and control groups that was not sustained at the final follow-up period.</P><P>Finally, given that the burden of ETS is shifting more and more towards low- and middle-income countries, and that in high-income countries the burden is disproportionately falling on disadvantaged households, findings of the studies included in this review may not be generalisable, as these trials were conducted mainly in high-income countries.</P></SUBSECTION></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-26 12:02:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-26 12:02:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><UL><LI>There is currently insufficient evidence to support one strategy over another to reduce the prevalence or level of children's environmental tobacco smoke exposure.</LI><LI>There is no clear evidence of difference in levels of success between different settings, including well-child, ill-child and community contexts.</LI><LI>There is limited support for the delivery of more intensive counselling interventions to parent(s).</LI></UL></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-24 18:53:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><UL><LI>Given the potential for bias in parental reports of children's environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, future studies should use biochemical verification of children's exposure to or absorption of ETS.</LI><LI>Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to adequately explore the effects of family and carer interventions in reducing children's exposure to ETS.</LI><LI>Studies should be designed and powered with consideration of the reduction in children's ETS exposure that occurs in comparison groups and in the wider community.</LI><LI>Studies should minimise risk of bias, whilst providing detailed descriptions of methods used during randomisation and allocation concealment.</LI><LI>Researchers should provide detailed descriptions of interventions to aid reproducibility.</LI><LI>More studies are required to assess the impact of identical interventions to ascertain quantitative effect estimates.</LI><LI>Study reports must mention costs.</LI><LI>Further underpowered and/or low-quality studies are unlikely to enhance understanding in this field.</LI></UL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-24 18:54:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Jamie Hartmann-Boyce from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group for assessing risk of bias for previously included studies.

Lots coming out of this team. The adverse effects of secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in children are well documented and include higher risks of respiratory illnesses, asthma, middle ear disease and SIDS. Infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are particularly vulnerable to the effects of SHSe, typically exhibiting respiratory or chronic lung conditions prior to discharge. The primary aim of this investigation is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a hospital-based, motivational interviewing intervention for reducing SHSe in a low-income, multi-ethnic population of NICU infants, with followup at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge. A total of 144 families with an infant at high respiratory risk in the NICU who reported at least one smoker in the household were randomized to MI, Usual Care (UC), or Usual Care with Reduced Measurement (UC-RM; abbreviated baseline and no 1 or 3 month assessments were conducted). The MI intervention included two 30-45 minute counseling sessions in the NICU. Outcomes included selfreported smoking in the home via Timeline Followback (TLFB) and air nicotine monitors. Of the 947 families approached in the NICU, 26% reported a household smoker in the home, 20% refused to participate in the study and another 8% failed to attend the baseline assessment. Six infants died prior to randomization. Of the MI participants, 86.4% attended Session 1, and only 71.2% attended both sessions. At 6-months postdischarge, according to TLFB and monitor data, 51.4% and 58.8% of the MI and UC homes were smoke-free, respectively. However, only 37.5% of the UC-RM group had smoke-free homes. We conclude that recruitment and intervention with NICU parents in a SHSe study is feasible, although improvements are needed. MI as implemented did not increase effects over assessment alone. Thus, assessment and discussion of SHSe in the NICU may increase the likelihood of a smoke-free home post-discharge, yet more intensive intervention is needed to strengthen effects. Effective interventions to reduce SHSe in households with NICU infants at high respiratory risk could result in substantial decreases in adverse health effects and the very large associated costs&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2018-01-29 12:04:45 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Counsellor used motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioural therapy to engage the parent in a smoking cessation attempt. All parents were encouraged to institute a strict home and car no-smoking policy, regardless of whether they wanted to stop smoking. If parent wanted to stop smoking, counsellors offered an 8-session weekly telephone intervention based on an evidence-based telephone smoking cessation protocol.

Reduced measurement group refers to reducing follow-up, as this is thought to affect the behaviour of the control group.</P></CHAR_INTERVENTIONS><CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Air nicotine monitors</P><P>Infant end-tidal carbon monoxide</P><P>Self-report measures of home and car smoking bans</P></CHAR_OUTCOMES><CHAR_USER_DEF_1 MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Child with health problems (respiratory disorders)</P></CHAR_USER_DEF_1><CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>In process of publication, information taken from a report</P></CHAR_NOTES></INCLUDED_CHAR><INCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks" STUDY_ID="STD-Streja-2014"><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>Country: USA</P><P>Setting: community (home)</P><P>Type: RCT</P></CHAR_METHODS><CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P>242 parents or guardians of children aged 2 to 14 years with asthma from low-income, predominantly ethnic minority families, living in households with at least 1 current smoker where smoking had occurred at home</P></CHAR_PARTICIPANTS><CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks"><P><U>Intervention</U>: tailored Spanish/English video addressing implications of SHS exposure for children with asthma, possible efficacy of household SHS exposure reductions on the child's health and frequency of asthma attacks, and strategies to reduce household SHS exposure.

There was, however, no change in cigarette smoke absorption as measured by children's urinary cotinine (ng/ml) for the intervention group over the 12 months (with measures collected at 3, 6 and 12 months). Cigarette smoke absorption for the control group increased from 9.4 ng/ml to 17.5 ng/ml over this time period, whereas there was almost no change in the intervention group (10.9 at baseline and 10.5 at 12 months). This increase in absorption observed for children in the control group appears to account for the apparent benefit of the intervention group. However the argument that this is solely due to reduced exposure in the home is uncertain, as the mothers in both the intervention and control groups reported falls in mothers' cigarettes smoked in the presence of the child from 3.9 to 0.5 (intervention) and 3.5 to 1.2 (control) cigarettes per day. In addition, they reported falls in total exposure to any source of cigarettes per day from 7.3 to 1.2 (intervention) and 7.2 to 2.8 (control). As the cotinine indicates a minimal fall for the intervention group and almost a doubling in urinary cotinine for the control group, either the cotinine measurement is unreliable or, more probably, that the parental report of cigarette exposure is not reliable.<BR/></P></TD></TR></OTHER_DATA><OTHER_DATA MODIFIED="2018-01-26 15:52:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks" ORDER="36" STUDY_ID="STD-Hovell-2002"><TR><TD><P>Latino families targeted.

Schools in one district used a tobacco control curriculum, and the control group were students in another district. The other school-based study was a cardiovascular health promotion programme that included an intervention designed to limit children's ETS exposure and negative role modelling from staff and visitors smoking at school (Elder 1996). Conducted in the USA, this study used a cluster-randomized design with schools as the unit of allocation.Number (proportion) of smoking fathers: Intervention baseline 6843/9953 (68.8%) &amp; follow up
