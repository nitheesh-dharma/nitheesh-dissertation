<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Priapism (the prolonged painful erection of the penis) is common in males with sickle cell disease. The length of time priapism lasts differs for different types and so does the medical treatment for it. Self-management approaches may be helpful. We looked for randomised controlled trials of different treatments to find the best option.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We last looked for evidence on 15 September 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found three trials set in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK involving 102 people.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In the trials, four different drug treatments (stilboestrol, sildenafil, ephedrine and etilefrine) were compared to placebo. The trials all looked at whether the treatments reduced how often attacks of priapism occurred. There was no difference between any of the treatments compared to placebo. Due to lack of evidence, we are not able to conclude the best treatment of priapism in sickle cell disease. More research is needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We considered the quality of evidence to be low to very low as all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-25 11:26:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders. The predominant symptom associated with sickle cell disease is pain resulting from the occlusion of small blood vessels by abnormally 'sickle-shaped' red blood cells. There are other complications, including chronic organ damage and prolonged painful erection of the penis, known as priapism. Severity of sickle cell disease is variable, and treatment is usually symptomatic. Priapism affects up to half of all men with sickle cell disease, however, there is no consistency in treatment. We therefore need to know the best way of treating this complication in order to offer an effective interventional approach to all affected individuals.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-09-15 13:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.

<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing non-surgical or surgical treatment with placebo or no treatment, or with another intervention for stuttering or fulminant priapism.</P>

<P>The authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-01 20:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Three trials with 102 participants were identified and met the criteria for inclusion in this review. These trials compared stilboestrol to placebo, sildenafil to placebo and ephedrine or etilefrine to placebo and ranged in duration from two weeks to six months. All of the trials were conducted in an outpatient setting in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK. None of the trials measured our first primary outcome, detumescence but all three trials reported on the reduction in frequency of stuttering priapism, our second primary outcome. No significant effect of any of the treatments was seen compared to placebo. Immediate side effects were not found to be significantly different from placebo in the two trials where this information was reported. We considered the quality of evidence to be low to very low as all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is a lack of evidence for the benefits or risks of the different treatments for both stuttering and fulminant priapism in sickle cell disease. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in sickle cell disease.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-19 10:57:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-01 20:56:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-01 20:54:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, caused by inheritance from both parents of an altered beta-globin chain gene of which one at least is beta S. SCD affects people originating from Sub-Saharan Africa, the African diaspora, Arab countries, the Mediterranean and South America (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>). Approximately 75,000 people in the USA (mostly African-Americans) (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2002</LINK>), and about one in 60 West Africans (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>) are affected by SCD. There are on average 160 children born with SCD in England each year (<LINK REF="REF-Hickman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of SCD is caused by the abnormal haemoglobin within red blood cells causing deformation or sickling of the cells when they give up oxygen. These abnormal cells block blood vessels causing vaso-occlusion, resulting in symptoms and organ damage.</P>
<P>Priapism is the persistence of erection that does not result from sexual desire and fails to subside despite orgasm. There are two kinds of priapism: low-flow ischaemic or veno-occlusive priapism, which is the form seen in SCD and high-flow priapism or non-ischaemic, which is associated with external trauma causing damage to the cavernosal artery. Priapism is usually accompanied by pain and tenderness. It can occur in all age groups, with a reported peak incidence in SCD between the ages of 5 to 10 years and 20 to 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Lue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 1998</LINK>). However, work from Jamaica suggests that the onset of priapism can be anytime between the ages of 5 and 45 years, with the peak incidence among young adults (aged 20 years to 25 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Emond-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1980</LINK>). Typically, priapism only affects the corpora cavernosa (very rarely the corpus spongiosum may be affected) (<LINK REF="REF-Lue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 1998</LINK>), thus surgical treatments to relieve priapism are designed to remove blood from the corpora cavernosa. Low-flow priapism may result in impotence or erectile dysfunction secondary to corporeal fibrosis.</P>
<P>There is no clear demarcation between a prolonged erection and priapism. However, many would call an erection lasting over six hours fulminant or prolonged priapism. This is because in the low-flow type (as occurs in the priapism of SCD) penile ischaemia and acidosis occur after six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Broderick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broderick 1994</LINK>). Others, however, call an erection in males with SCD a priapic episode when it is in excess of one hour, or when it is painful.</P>
<P>Priapism is a common occurrence in SCD and may occur as acute episodes or the so-called stuttering priapism, defined as recurrent episodes of prolonged erections. These can last from a few minutes to three hours. Stuttering priapism by repetitive vaso-occlusion can lead to erectile dysfunction, and may develop into full-blown priapism. Treatment is aimed at preventing such an occurrence. In one study of men with homozygous SCD (SS) in a Jamaican clinic, stuttering nocturnal attacks of priapism lasting two to six hours affected 42 per cent of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). A more recent questionnaire study from the USA reported an actuarial probability of experiencing priapism by the age of 20 years as 89% (+/- 9%) (<LINK REF="REF-Mantadakis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantadakis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Red cell sickling and later sludging of blood occur in the corpora cavernosa, perhaps as a result of abnormal endothelial adherence, the relatively acidic state of the corpora during erection, mild acidosis accompanying hypoventilation during sleep, or mild trauma with masturbation and intercourse. When the venous channels are maximally compressed during nocturnal penile tumescence, the sludged red cells can block the microscopic subtunical venules and trigger diffuse veno-occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Lue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 1998</LINK>). More recent evidence has shown that priapism results from deficient erection control mechanisms at a molecular level (<LINK REF="REF-Bivalacqua-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bivalacqua 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:36:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sherie Smith">
<P>Interventions for priapism fall into two categories of preventing or reducing the frequency of priapic attacks, and treating fulminant priapic episodes. Several treatments have been described including: analgesia; hydration; blood alkalinisation; red cell transfusion; partial exchange transfusion to lower haemoglobin S; pharmaceutical agents and surgical procedures such as washouts. Surgical shunt procedures and even penile implantation have been described for intractable cases (<LINK REF="REF-Upadhyay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upadhyay 1998</LINK>). Current treatments focus on resolving acute attacks and are often administered too late during an episode. With improved understanding of the true pathophysiology of priapism in SCD, newer treatments aim to target disease specific molecular abnormalities. Recent research suggests that there is abnormal signalling of the endothelium-derived nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) signal transduction pathway in the penis (<LINK REF="REF-Bivalacqua-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bivalacqua 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-24 13:53:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sherie Smith">
<P>With a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of priapism in men with SCD, interventions can be better targeted at the underlying cause. Interventions to treat an acute attack aim to abort the attack and restore normal vascular homeostasis. It is thought that the nitric oxide imbalance leads to PDE5 dysregulation which then has a physiological impact on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphatecAMP activity. Treatments that interrupt abnormal mechanisms may be effective in reducing the frequency of attacks.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-01 20:56:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Priapism is associated with with long-term erectile dysfunction and psychological consequences in often young men with SCD. It is important to review the evidence for interventions to treat acute episodes of priapism but also to prevent or reduce episodes in the longer term. Treatment of acute and stuttering priapism often depends on the type of clinician or institution to whom the male with SCD presents. With an increasing understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the condition, new treatments such as etilefrine, an &#945; adrenergic stimulator, and sildenafil, are showing encouraging results for preventing priapism (<LINK REF="REF-Bachir-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachir 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okpala-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okpala 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virag-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virag 1996</LINK>). This review seeks to determine safe, effective interventions for preventing or treating (or both) priapism.</P>

<P>Nine references to three trials (with a total of 102 participants) on the treatment of stuttering priapism, were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>) (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The two more recent trials are both double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trials with treatment periods ranging from eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>) to 26 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>). The third trial is a double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over trial, in which participants who did not respond to the first arm of the trial were entered into the second arm of the trial with no washout period described (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). There were no randomised trials of treatments for fulminant priapism. The literature reveals several case reports and case series of well-established therapies and experimental therapies for stuttering and fulminant priapism.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants and setting</HEADING>
<P>The 102 participants across the three trials were all outpatients with confirmed SCD and stuttering priapism from clinics in the USA, Nigeria, the UK and Jamaica. Olujohungbe recruited from clinics in the middle east for a short period due to poor recruitment in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>). The inclusion criteria for the Burnett and Serjeant trials stated that participants had to have at least two stuttering priapism episodes per week (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). The Olujohungbe trial did not specify the number of episodes of stuttering priapism per week, but did exclude participants who had an attack which lasted longer than four hours or required hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mean (SD) age of participants ranged from 21.7 (5.3) years (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK> Sildenafil group) to 24.3 (3.1) years (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). Participant numbers were low in two of the trials with Burnett including 13 participants and Serjeant including only 11 (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). The Olujohungbe trial required 320 participants to give 80% power to detect differences of 1.5 attacks per month between groups and did include larger numbers of participants but they only enrolled 131 of the required 320 and only 78 were eligible to be randomised to the intervention phase. Only 46 of these participants were included in the analysis and only 25 completed the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of intervention</HEADING>
<P>All three trials report on different treatments from each other but they all compare to a placebo. The Serjeant trial looks at the preventive effects of 5 mg of stilboestrol on stuttering priapism (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). Burnett looks at the effect of sildenafil 50 mg, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, given once daily over eight weeks on preventing attacks of priapism (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>). Olujohungbe looks at the effect of two oral alpha-adrenergic agonists against placebo, etilefrine 50 mg, and two different doses of ephedrine (15 mg and 30 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>). In this trial the participants completed diaries in an observation phase for three to thirteen weeks before taking part in the randomised intervention phase. During the intervention phase participants were asked to take either 15 mg ephedrine, 30 mg ephedrine, 50 mg etilefrine or a placebo once daily, at bedtime for six months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials looked at our main primary outcome of detumescence or resolution of a priapism attack but all three trials measured the effect of treatment on the frequency of attacks. Burnett used a scoring system to record the frequency of attacks where 0 = no episodes, 1 = one to two episodes, 2 = three to four episodes, 3 = five to eight episodes and 4 = nine to sixteen episodes and also reported on the duration of episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>).The trial of stilboestrol also reported on the return of priapism after a period of no attacks (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). The two more recent trials reported on immediate side effects of treatment but the specific side effects recorded were different in the two trials due to the actions of the medications being different. Burnett reported on headache, flushing, nasal congestion, abnormal vision, dyspepsia, myalgia whilst Olujohungbe reported on palpitations, tachycardia, lack of sleep, hand shaking, anxiety and dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>). The ephedrine and etilefrine trial was the only trial to look at longer term effects by recording the effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure but this was as a safety mechanism. Where participants were found to have an increase in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg and an increase in diastolic pressure of 10 mmHg the trial medication was discontinued (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>).</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2017-07-25 12:10:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>All three trials were described as double-blind (physician and participant) and we therefore assessed this domain as low risk. In the Olujohungbe trial, blinding of the trial drugs was done by an external clinical trial supplies company. In the Burnett trial, adverse events were reported for the whole of the treatment period (confirmed by the author team) including the open label phase and we therefore have not entered the data into our analysis as this would bias the results (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>).</P>
</BLINDING>
<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-25 12:10:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The Burnett trial included 13 participants and analysed the data both on an intention-to-treat basis and on a per protocol basis. All 13 participants' data were included in the analysis and the trial was deemed to be at low risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the trial of ephedrine and etilefrine had higher numbers of participants, there was a high rate of attrition at each phase of the trial. The authors stated that 320 participants were needed to give 80% power to detect differences of 1.5 attacks per month between groups. The number enrolled was much less than this (131) and only a proportion completed the observation phase thus enabling them to be randomised to the treatment phase. Of the 78 participants that were randomised to the intervention phase, data was only available for 46 of them. The remainder were lost to follow up. Just under half of the participants analysed completed the full 26 weeks of treatment. We deemed this trial to be at a high risk of bias due to attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the cross-over trial one participant defaulted, and in two participants the attacks of stuttering priapism ceased spontaneously during the baseline observation period. There was a fourth participant who initially did not take the placebo because a painful crisis aborted the stuttering priapism prior to taking the assigned tablet. In this participant (identified as patient nine) attacks of priapism recurred two weeks later and data on a second baseline period were collected. The paper did not discuss an intention-to-treat analysis and we therefore assessed this paper as being at an unclear risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>).</P>

Seven out of the 13 participants were hospitalised 14 times over the course of the trial (53.8%). Of these hospitalisations, 10 visits made by six participants were due to major priapism episodes. Two of these episodes occurred in participants who were taking sildenafil (20%) and the remaining eight occurred in participants who were taking placebo treatment (80%) (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-15 13:01:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Since the last update we have found two further trials of treatments for priapism in boys and men with sickle cell disease bringing the number of included trials to three (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serjeant-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Serjeant 1985</LINK>). The three trials included small numbers of participants, had different trial designs and assessed four different drug treatments. None of the trials primarily looked at fulminant priapism and so no trials reported on detumescence, one of our primary outcomes. No significant effect of any of the treatments was seen in relation to our second primary outcome of reduction in frequency of stuttering priapism. The only secondary outcome reported was immediate side effects which were reported in two of the trials but in one of the trials, the reporting of side effects was done for the whole treatment period including the open label phase which may have biased the results. A summary of the results is presented in the summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>)</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:58:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We are confident that the searches were thorough and have identified all the available trials. The included trials were generally complete although we needed to clarify a couple of issues with the author team. However, the small number of participants and the high attrition rate limit the applicability of the results to the wider population of males with priapism related to sickle cell disease.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-09-15 13:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The evidence provided by this review is low to very low quality, limited by the quantity and quality of the trials. All of the trials were randomised but the method of randomisation and allocation concealment were unclear. The risk of bias for blinding was deemed to be low as all three of the trials were double blind. The Burnett trial, however, reported on an open label phase for a period of time after the double-blind phase of the trial. Immediate side effects of treatment were reported for the whole period, so there was the possibility that participants under or over reported any side effects due to the knowledge of the treatment they were on (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Poor recruitment and attrition bias were problems in the Olujohungbe trial where large numbers were required to show a significant effect. In stuttering priapism young males may be reluctant to report this complication of sickle cell disease and may also be reluctant to participate in research. Similarly, the nature of the disease may have been the reason for the number of men lost to follow-up. Without information on why the participants failed to complete the trial it is not possible to comment on the evidence provided by those that did complete the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Olujohungbe-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Olujohungbe 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The quality and quantity of the trials included in this review were not sufficient to allow firm conclusions about treatment for priapism in sickle cell disease to be made at the present time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:59:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Well-designed, adequately-powered trials with multicentre collaboration are desperately required to provide evidence for the most effective treatment required to alleviate suffering in people with sickle cell disease. Large numbers of participants would be required in a randomised clinical trial to provide the evidence base for drug therapy of priapism and to demonstrate that one regimen is more efficacious than another. In acute or fulminant priapism, it would be unethical to have a placebo-controlled (randomised) trial. However, trials could be conducted comparing one agent against another, e.g. different alpha agonists.</P>
