<P>Continuous stitching causes less pain than interrupted absorbable stitches when used for repairing the perineum after childbirth.</P>
<P>When women give birth, the perineum (the area between the vaginal opening and back passage) sometimes tears or it may be necessary for them to have an episiotomy (surgical cut) to increase the size of the vaginal outlet to facilitate the birth. Episiotomies and tears that involve the muscle layer (second degree) need to be stitched. Millions of women worldwide undergo perineal suturing after childbirth and the type of repair may have an impact on pain and discomfort, and healing. In the UK alone, approximately 1000 women per day will experience perineal stitches following vaginal birth and millions more worldwide. A midwife or doctor will stitch the episiotomy or second-degree tear in three layers (vagina, perineal muscle and skin). Traditionally the vagina is stitched using a continuous locking stitch and the perineal muscles and skin are repaired using approximately three or four individual stitches, each needing to be knotted separately to prevent them from dislodging. Researchers have been suggesting for more than 70 years that the 'continuous non-locking stitching method' is better than 'traditional interrupted methods'. This review looked at 'continuous stitching methods' compared with 'traditional interrupted stitching methods' and identified 16 randomised controlled trials involving 8184 women from eight different countries. Results from the trials showed that stitching just underneath the skin (subcutaneous) was associated with less pain with reduced need for analgesics after the birth, or for the sutures to be removed; however, when the 'continuous stitching method' was used for repair of all three layers, this may be associated with even less pain. The level of operator skill and training varied in the different trials. Other research is needed to assess perineal repair training programmes. In addition, research is needed to look at interventions that may reduce the incidence of perineal trauma during childbirth.</P>
<P>There is also some evidence that the continuous techniques use less suture material when compared with the interrupted methods (one packet compared to two or three packets, respectively).</P>

There was an overall reduction in analgesia use associated with the continuous subcutaneous technique versus interrupted stitches for repair of perineal skin (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84). There was also a reduction in suture removal in the continuous suturing groups versus interrupted (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98), but no significant differences were seen in the need for re-suturing of wounds or long-term pain.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalence and morbidity</HEADING>
<P>Perineal trauma during childbirth affects millions of women throughout the world and can result in long-term maternal morbidity. In the UK approximately 85%<B> </B>of women will sustain some degree of perineal trauma during vaginal birth and 60% to 70%<B> </B>of these will need suturing<B>, </B>which equates to approximately 1000 women per day (<LINK REF="REF-McCandlish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCandlish 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>). However, rates of perineal trauma will vary considerably according to individual practices and policies of institutions and practitioners throughout the world. Perineal trauma may occur spontaneously during birth, or the midwife or obstetrician may need to make a surgical incision (episiotomy) to increase the diameter of the vaginal outlet to facilitate the baby's birth. Childbirth-related perineal tears are classified according to the anatomical structures involved into; first degree (involving the perineal skin only), second degree (involving the perineal muscles and skin), third degree (injury to the anal sphincter complex - 3a = less than 50% of the external anal sphincter torn; 3b = more than 50% of the external anal sphincter torn; 3c = internal anal sphincter also torn) and fourth degree (injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex and anal epithelium)<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2006</LINK>).<B>
<BR/>
</B>The majority of women experience some short-term discomfort or pain following perineal repair, and up to 20% will continue to have long-term problems, such as superficial dyspareunia (painful intercourse) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1984</LINK>). Short- and long-term maternal morbidity associated with perineal repair can lead to major physical, psychological and social problems, affecting the woman's ability to care for her new baby and other members of the family (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>). For those women who sustain perineal injury, it is important that skilled operators repair the trauma, and that they use the best suturing techniques and materials, in order to minimise any associated problems.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Techniques of perineal repair</HEADING>
<P>Currently, midwives in the UK are responsible for suturing the majority of second-degree tears and episiotomies sustained during spontaneous vaginal delivery. However, there are wide variations in both techniques and materials used for perineal repair between individual practitioners and maternity units. The rationale for the suturing technique chosen appears to evolve from the way the operator was first taught rather than robust clinical evidence. It could be hypothesised that even if the best suture techniques and materials are used to repair perineal trauma, the short- and long-term outcome will be dependent on the skill of the operator.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Traditional interrupted technique</HEADING>
<P>Perineal trauma is traditionally repaired in three stages: a continuous locking stitch is inserted to close the vaginal trauma, commencing at the apex of the wound and finishing at the level of the fourchette with a loop knot. The proposed rationale for using a locking stitch is to prevent shortening of the vagina; however, good-quality evidence to support this theory is lacking. The perineal muscles are then re-approximated with three or four interrupted sutures and finally, the perineal skin is closed by inserting continuous subcutaneous or interrupted transcutaneous stitches. Another variation of the interrupted suture technique involves placing inverted interrupted stitches to re-approximate the muscle layer. The skin is then closed with inverted interrupted stitches placed in the subcutaneous tissue a few millimetres under the perineal skin edges (not transcutaneously). The rationale for this alternative technique is that the knots are 'hidden' in the depth of the perineal trauma and the interrupted skin suture knots are also buried to facilitate healing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Two-stage technique</HEADING>
<P>This method is very similar to the traditional interrupted technique whereby the vaginal trauma is closed with a continuous locking stitch, followed by insertion of three or four interrupted stitches to re-approximate the perineal muscles; however, the skin is left apposed but not sutured (skin edges no more than half a centimetre apart). The rationale behind this technique is that the insertion of skin sutures may contribute to some of the morbidity experienced by women following perineal repair. Women often complain of pain and tightness associated with transcutaneous skin sutures; moreover, if standard synthetic material is used there is an increased risk of the stitches having to be removed up to three months following birth (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Continuous non-locking technique</HEADING>
<P>This is a three-stage technique: the repair begins with an anchoring stitch above the apex of the vaginal trauma and the deep tissues and mucosa are closed with a single continuous non-locking stitch, in contrast to the locking stitch used for the traditional method. The perineal muscles are then re-approximated using a similar continuous non-locking technique and the repair is completed with a continuous suture inserted well below the skin surface in the subcutaneous fascia. The finished repair is secured with a knot placed in the vagina behind the hymenal remnants. A single length of absorbable suture material is used for the repair with no knots other than the anchoring and terminal knot. The rationale for using this suturing technique is that it is very easy to over tighten locked or interrupted stitches, which may restrict the distribution of tissue oedema and cause increased pain. With the continuous technique, the tension is transferred throughout the whole length of the single suture; also the skin sutures are inserted well below the skin surface, thus avoiding the nerve endings to reduce pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aim of the review</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this review is to examine the available research and to establish if there is any clear scientific evidence that the technique used for perineal repair, following childbirth, has any effect on the amount of pain and superficial dyspareunia experienced by women in the postpartum period.</P>
<P>This systematic review includes 16 randomised clinical trials and represents a substantial update of the previous Cochrane review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We are aware that achieving blinding for this intervention is not likely to have occurred as the suture technique will be apparent to clinical staff carrying out the repair or assessing the healing of the perineum, and may be apparent to women. It is possible though, that for some outcomes those carrying out outcome assessment may be blind to group allocation. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We have noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate;</LI>
<LI>inadequate;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For outcomes assessed in the early postpartum period loss to follow-up had to be less that 10% for us to judge a study as adequate. For longer-term outcomes (e.g. dyspareunia at three months' postpartum) we expected less than 20% attrition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias such as baseline imbalance.</P>
<P>We have assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>

<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We have made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we have assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We have explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis.</LINK> </P>

<P>Twelve<B> </B>trials in this review compared continuous suture techniques<B> </B>with interrupted methods for perineal closure (all layers or skin only). Within the 'interrupted suture' comparison groups, the perineal muscle and skin were closed with interrupted stitches; whereas, in the 'continuous suture' groups, two of the included trials used interrupted sutures to repair the perineal muscles prior to continuous subcutaneous closure of the perineal skin (continuous for perineal skin only) (<LINK REF="STD-Banninger-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Banninger 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1989</LINK>). The other 12<B> </B>trials used a continuous suturing technique throughout to close the vagina and perineal muscles prior to subcutaneous skin closure in the 'continuous suture' groups (continuous for all layers) (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Croce-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Croce 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Detlefsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Detlefsen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isager_x002d_Sally-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isager-Sally 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kindberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kindberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokanali-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kokanali 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perveen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perveen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stark-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stark 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valenzuela-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Valenzuela 2009</LINK>); in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2008</LINK> a separate suture was used to close the perineal skin intradermally following continuous closure of the vagina and perineal muscles in the 'continuous' group.</P>
<P>Two trials in the review compared a two-stage technique of perineal repair to the more traditional three-stage approach (the suture techniques were not clearly described) (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oboro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Oboro 2003</LINK>). In the two-stage technique the vagina and perineal muscles were sutured and the skin was left apposed but not sutured (skin edges no more than half a centimetre apart). In comparison, in the three-stage method, the vagina and perineal muscles were sutured and the skin was re-approximated with interrupted or continuous subcutaneous sutures (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for details).</P>
<P>Two trials examined other comparisons. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Zafar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zafar 2008</LINK> in the 'continuous suture' group the vaginal mucosa was closed with a running stitch and the same suture was used to re-approximate the perineal muscle in two layers, followed by subcuticular sutures to close the skin (finishing at the lower end of the incision). In the 'interrupted' comparison group the vaginal mucosa was closed with a continuous running stitch, followed by interrupted sutures inserted in two layers to re-approximate the perineal muscles and the skin was closed using continuous (subcuticular) sutures. One trial used interrupted inverted sutures in the 'interrupted' comparison group to close the perineal muscles, followed by interrupted inverted stiches to re-approximate the skin (sutures were inserted a few millimetres under the skin edges and not transcutaneously) (<LINK REF="STD-Kindberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kindberg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the trials included in the review used polyglycolic acid (Dexon) suture material throughout for repair of the vagina, perineal muscles and skin in each comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-Banninger-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Banninger 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Detlefsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Detlefsen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isager_x002d_Sally-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isager-Sally 1986</LINK>).

Participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1998</LINK> trial were repaired with chromic catgut (approximately 50%) and polyglactin 910 (Standard Vicryl) suture material (approximately 50%); participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1989</LINK> trial were repaired with chromic catgut (approximately 50%) and polyglycolic acid (Dexon) suture material (approximately 50%); participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK> trial were repaired with the more rapidly absorbing Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide) or Polyglactin 910 (Standard Vicryl) suture material (50%) in each comparison group; participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Kokanali-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kokanali 2011</LINK> trial were repaired with monofilament or multifilament suture material (50%) in each group and the participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Perveen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perveen 2009</LINK> trial used chromic catgut or Polyglactin 910 (Standard Vicryl) suture material (50%) in each comparison group.</P>
<P>All 16 trials used absorbable suture material; however, there were some variations among type of material, gauge and needle size used.

<P>Blinding the staff carrying out repairs would not be feasible with an intervention of this type. Staff frequently required additional training to be able to participate in trials, and frequently the same staff carried out both types of repair. In some of the trial reports information on protocol deviations was provided, and this indicates that staff may have had a preferred method of repair, and greater skill and confidence using a particular technique.</P>
<P>In most of the studies blinding women was not generally attempted, although authors sometimes claimed that women were blind to group allocation (women were simply not told which group they were in). <LINK REF="STD-Kindberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kindberg 2008</LINK> reported that the two methods "appeared similar", and <LINK REF="STD-Morano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morano 2006</LINK> referred to a "double-blind" study technique. Blinding women may not have been convincing as women would have been able to feel the repair, could possibly have seen it, discussed it with staff and others, and may well have had access to case notes. Moreover, women would probably have been aware of the type of repair if they had required suture removal, or had particular problems.</P>
<P>Blinding outcome assessors was also unlikely to have been convincing. <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Valenzuela-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Valenzuela 2009</LINK> reported that interview data were collected by "blind" midwives, and <LINK REF="STD-Kindberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kindberg 2008</LINK> reported that the two techniques would "appear similar" to staff. Most of these studies collected outcome data that would necessitate examination of the perineum, and the type of repair may have been apparent to experienced clinicians.</P>
<P>The difficulties associated with blinding women, clinical staff and researchers to treatment allocation in these studies is potentially a serious source of bias particularly as several key outcomes (pain) involved women reporting to staff who would be aware of treatment allocation, and may even have carried out the repairs themselves.</P>

In the 'interrupted' comparison group the vaginal mucosa was closed with a continuous running stitch, followed by interrupted sutures inserted in two layers to re-approximate the perineal muscles and the skin was closed using continuous (subcuticular) suture.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-02 16:17:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Therese Dowswell">
<P>The meta-analysis of data provides evidence that continuous techniques for perineal closure (all layers or skin only)<B> </B>cause less pain in the immediate postpartum period, less need for analgesia and less need for suture removal compared with interrupted stitching methods. However, there is a significant degree of heterogeneity between trials for several outcomes that may be a result of clinical heterogeneity in terms of input in perineal repair training, different suturing techniques and materials used (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables for details).</P>
<P>There is also some evidence that the continuous technique uses less suture material when compared with the interrupted methods (one packet compared to two or three packets, respectively). This is important information, as the introduction of a continuous suturing policy would reduce the overall suture material expenditure for maternity units worldwide.</P>
<P>To investigate the heterogeneity of results between the different trials, in line with the philosophy of <LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1987</LINK>, we considered the possible sources of heterogeneity. In particular, we looked at the heterogeneity of treatment effects stratified by continuous suturing for all layers versus continuous subcutaneous for closure of perineal skin only. Six<B> </B>of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Croce-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Croce 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Detlefsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Detlefsen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isager_x002d_Sally-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isager-Sally 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morano 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perveen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Perveen 2009</LINK>) used a non-locking continuous suturing technique to repair the vagina and perineal muscles with a continuous subcutaneous stitch inserted to close the skin in the experimental group; four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Croce-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Croce 1997</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Detlefsen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Detlefsen 1980</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Isager_x002d_Sally-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isager-Sally 1986</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK>) used a locking suture for the vagina, and interrupted sutures to repair perineal muscle and skin in the control group and the<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Morano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morano 2006</LINK>
<B> </B>trial used a non-locking suture for repair of the vaginal mucosa, three or four interrupted stitches to repair the deep and superficial perineal muscles, and interrupted transcutaneous stitches inserted to close the skin. The other two trials by <LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Banninger-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Banninger 1978</LINK> used a locking continuous stitch and interrupted stitches to repair the vagina, respectively; interrupted stitches for the muscle layer and continuous subcutaneous stitches versus interrupted for skin closure.</P>
<P>The rationale for performing continuous suturing indicates that any benefit would be larger in those trials that use continuous suturing throughout for all layers, therefore this was investigated by performing stratified subgroup analysis. However, there remained considerable heterogeneity within the continuous 'all layers' group.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1989</LINK> trial reported that the subcutaneous method of perineal skin closure was less practiced and unpopular with some operators and there was some cross-over of treatment allocation (96 women in the subcutaneous group had interrupted transcutaneous stitches inserted). In the <LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2008</LINK> trial, there was also evidence of treatment cross-over for women allocated to the interrupted suture group. Deviation from protocol and variation in technique within trial arms mean that results were more difficult to interpret. In the <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK> trial, adherence to treatment allocation was very high. Perhaps the better results produced by the <LINK REF="STD-Isager_x002d_Sally-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isager-Sally 1986</LINK> trial were because of the continuous technique being introduced several months prior to the trial starting, thus ensuring that all members of staff were familiar with the new technique of perineal repair. In the <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK> trial, midwives received standardised training in both techniques (interrupted and continuous) prior to the study commencing.<B> </B>However, owing to rotation of midwives from the delivery suite and delay in starting the study, many of the participating midwives were not familiar with the continuous technique and were trained during the early part of the recruitment phase. During the first phase of the <LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK> trial, senior midwives were more likely to undertake the continuous suturing. This imbalance was considered in a subsequent association analysis; however, there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between groups.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis also showed that continuous techniques were associated with a reduction in the need for suture removal up to three months following childbirth. It could be argued that this finding may be because continuous subcutaneous stitches are less accessible than interrupted transcutaneous stitches. Nevertheless, this finding is important, as most women find the experience of having sutures removed from perineal wounds very distressing.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-28 09:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Therese Dowswell">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence on which conclusions of the review are based was mixed. For methods of randomisation approximately half of the studies used methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment that we assessed as low risk of bias, while in other trials' methods were either not described, not clear or were at high risk of bias. Blinding operatives for this type of intervention may not be feasible and attempts to blind outcome assessors may not be convincing. It is difficult to assess whether lack of blinding of staff carrying out repairs affected other aspects of care, and for us to judge the overall impact of lack of blinding on outcomes. As we discussed above, some staff may have been more familiar with (and possibly preferred) one technique and this may have affected the quality of their repair and the way they assessed outcomes. An additional problem in some studies was the loss to follow-up; even relatively small losses to follow-up may be important for outcomes such as removal of suture material and the need for re-suturing where event rates are relatively low.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-09-28 09:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Therese Dowswell">
<P>We are aware that there is a risk of introducing bias at all stages in the review process. Assessing risk of bias, for example, involves individual judgements. We took a number of steps to reduce bias such as having two review authors assess each paper independently. One review author was an investigator in one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK>) and this author was therefore not involved in the assessment of evidence for this trial.</P>

<P>The evidence produced by this review shows that continuous suturing techniques for perineal closure is associated with less short-term pain. There is also some evidence that if the continuous technique is used for all layers (vagina, perineal muscles and skin), the benefit in terms of reducing pain may be even greater.</P>
<P>The continuous technique is easily performed by the novice or inexperienced operator. In addition, it has economical advantages in that the continuous technique requires one packet of suture material per perineal repair compared to two or more packets for the interrupted method<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Kettle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kettle 2002</LINK>). Therefore, the non-locking continuous suturing technique is recommended for repair of vagina and perineal muscles with a continuous subcutaneous stitch to close the perineal skin.</P>
