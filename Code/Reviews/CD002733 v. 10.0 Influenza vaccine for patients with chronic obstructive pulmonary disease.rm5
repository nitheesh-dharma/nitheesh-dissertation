There are differences between them in terms of the vaccine used and my feeling would be that they should be displayed without pooling of the two groups. Apart from this I am quite comfortable about the review.&lt;br&gt;Chris 27/5/00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC comments 11/5/00&lt;br&gt;Whilst I understand the reason to use modified Jadad scores how do you decide what is a good result; 3 or more is good on a five point scale so are you happy with 2 or more?&lt;br&gt;How did you ascertain the SD of the early and late exacerbations for the Howells results? Why is there such a difference between Fell and Howells??? Since these two are the only ones you combine on total patients with exacerbations and their POOLED result is not significant this does not sit comfortably with the conclusions at present!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Paul Jones 5 June 00 - review has been approved by Chris Cates (as assigned editor).&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-06-23 15:26:20 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="FLU-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.24" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 14:31:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Despite the almost universal recommendation that people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should receive an annual influenza vaccination, very few randomised controlled trials have evaluated the effect of influenza vaccination in these patients. This review looks at six studies in COPD patients and a further five in elderly or high risk patients, a proportion of whom had chronic lung disease. It shows that there is now some evidence from randomised trials that inactivated influenza vaccine indeed decreases "flare ups" of COPD, especially those that are related to the influenza virus itself. The inactivated influenza virus vaccine is given intramuscularly and is associated with an increase in local side effects such as pain at the site of injection. This is short-lived, not serious and is outweighed by the long term benefit of the vaccine. The inactivated virus vaccine does not cause influenza or any significant worsening of COPD.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-06-11 09:22:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Influenza vaccinations are currently recommended in the care of people with COPD, but these recommendations are based largely on evidence from observational studies with very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported. Influenza infection causes excess morbidity and mortality in COPD patients but there is also the potential for influenza vaccination to cause adverse effects or not to be cost effective. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the evidence from RCTs for a treatment effect of influenza vaccination in COPD subjects. Outcomes of interest were exacerbation rates, hospitalisations, mortality, lung function and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-11 09:21:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, and reference lists of articles. References were also provided by a number of drug companies we contacted. The latest search was carried out in May 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs that compared live or inactivated virus vaccines with placebo, either alone or with another vaccine in persons with COPD. Studies of people with asthma were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted data. All entries were double checked. Study authors and drug companies were contacted for missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-11 09:22:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Eleven trials were included but only six of these were specifically performed in COPD patients. The others were conducted on elderly and high-risk individuals, some of whom had chronic lung disease. Inactivated vaccine in COPD patients resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of exacerbations per vaccinated subject compared with those who received placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.37, 95% confidence interval -0.64 to -0.11, P = 0.006). This was due to the reduction in "late" exacerbations occurring after three or four weeks (WMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.18, P = 0.0004). In Howells 1961, the number of patients experiencing late exacerbations was also significantly less (odds ratio 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45, P = 0.002). Both Howells 1961 and Wongsurakiat 2004 found that inactivated influenza vaccination reduced influenza -related respiratory infections (WMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.48, P = 0.0005). In both COPD patient and in elderly patients (only a minority of whom had COPD), there was a significant increase in the occurrence of local adverse reactions in vaccinees, but the effects were generally mild and transient. There was no evidence of an effect of intranasal live attenuated virus when this was added to inactivated intramuscular vaccination. The studies are too small to have detected any effect on mortality.</P>
<P>An updated search conducted in September 2001did not yield any further studies. A search in 2003 yielded two further reports of the same eligible study Gorse 2003. A search in 2004 yielded two reports of the another eligible study Wongsurakiat 2004. The author informed us of another report of the same study Wongsurakiat 2004/2. An update search in May 2010 did not identify any new studies for consideration.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It appears, from the limited number of studies performed, that inactivated vaccine reduces exacerbations in COPD patients. The size of effect was similar to that seen in large observational studies, and was due to a reduction in exacerbations occurring three or more weeks after vaccination, and due to influenza. There is a mild increase in transient local adverse effects with vaccination, but no evidence of an increase in early exacerbations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-23 15:23:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in older people who have smoked, and is characterised by progressive airflow obstruction that is largely irreversible. As the disease progresses, exacerbations can occur several times per year, and may require hospital admission. These exacerbations can take several weeks to resolve, during which time considerable morbidity can occur and result in significant health care costs. Infection with influenza is an important cause of excess mortality and morbidity in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Rothbart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothbart 1995</LINK>), and may affect the progression of the disease (<LINK REF="STD-Centanni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Centanni 1997</LINK>). Patients with COPD are at an increased risk for respiratory illness-related hospitalisation during influenza outbreaks irrespective of age and degree of morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Monto-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monto 1987</LINK>). Medicines have a very limited role in the management of acute exacerbations and in altering the natural history of the disease. Strategies that prevent exacerbations are, therefore, very appealing.</P>
<P>Annual influenza vaccination is recommended almost universally in COPD guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Siafakas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siafakas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>). The largest body of evidence to support this recommendation comes from observational studies in the elderly. In a large, serial cohort study of nearly 150,000 elderly patients, those who had been vaccinated had a reduction of about 32% in the rates of hospitalisation for all respiratory conditions, and a reduction of approximately 50% in all cause mortality over their untreated counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1998</LINK>). In those subjects with chronic lung disease, vaccinated subjects had a 52% reduction in hospitalisations and a 70% reduction in death rate during influenza seasons (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1999</LINK>). A meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies of influenza vaccination in the elderly showed a 56% reduction in respiratory illness, a 53% reduction in pneumonia, a 50% reduction in hospitalisation, and a 68% reduction in deaths from all causes during influenza outbreaks (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1995</LINK>). The benefit was seen especially in epidemic years when the vaccine strain was identical or similar to the epidemic strain (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1995</LINK>). Most studies suggest that vaccination is very cost effective, for example, Nichol and co-workers estimated that vaccination was associated with a reduction in health care costs of about $US 171 per year per high risk person vaccinated (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The effectiveness of the vaccine depends on the immuno competence of the vaccine recipient and the degree of similarity between virus strains in the vaccine and those in circulation (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 1999</LINK>). Most vaccine programmes currently use an inactivated virus vaccine which contains three virus strains (usually 2 type A and 1 type B) representing the influenza viruses likely to circulate in the upcoming winter. The vaccine is made from highly purified, egg-grown viruses that have been inactivated. These vaccines may be whole virus, sub virion, or purified-surface-antigen preparations. The mechanism of protection by the vaccine is thought to occur via circulating antibodies to HA (Hemagglutinin) and NA (Neuramidase) acting against severe infection of the lower respiratory tract. Stimulation of cytotoxic T-cell responses may also be important (<LINK REF="REF-Patriarca-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patriarca 1994</LINK>). The elderly in general have lower phagocytic function, and mount less of an immune response to vaccination than younger people (<LINK REF="STD-Treanor-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Treanor 1992</LINK>). To improve vaccine efficacy, live attenuated viruses have been trialled. Levels of secretory anti-HAs, Igs and anti-influenza A virus cytotoxic T-cell responses were better in COPD patients after immunisation with monovalent live attenuated vaccine than with inactivated influenza A virus vaccines (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1995</LINK>). Some investigators have co-administered more than one type of vaccine, such as cold attenuated virus with inactivated virus vaccine, in an attempt to increase vaccine efficacy in COPD patients (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the recommendations in the guidelines, vaccination in the elderly (the age group that includes most COPD patients) is not universal. In USA in 1997, only 65.5% of the elderly were vaccinated in the previous year (<LINK REF="REF-BRFSS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">BRFSS 1998</LINK>). The only absolute contraindication to vaccination is chicken egg allergy. Other reasons for not vaccinating include uncertainty about the degree and longevity of protection in the elderly and concern about adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Patriarca-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patriarca 1994</LINK>). Patients and their doctors often express concern that vaccination precipitates exacerbations despite the fact that is not possible to contract influenza from inactivated virus. Adverse effects usually become manifest within 24 hours of vaccination and can be local or systemic. Several studies have shown that mild local side effects, at the site of injection are more common in vaccinated patients than in those given placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1995</LINK>). Systemic reactions include myalgia, fatigue, headache and low grade fever. These are more common in females and after the administration of whole-virus than sub virion vaccines. Higher doses and levels of pre-existing antibody also increase the likelihood of these reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Cate-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Cate 1977</LINK>). The most feared complication of influenza vaccination is Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). However, this is extremely rare (approximately 1/1,000,000) and the benefits of the vaccine are thought to far out-weigh the risks for developing vaccine-associated GBS (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review evaluates the evidence from RCTs that have studied the effect of influenza vaccination in people with COPD. </P>

<P>Abstracts of articles containing the words "controlled" or "randomised" and "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" or "chronic airways limitation" or "chronic obstructive airways disease" or "chronic bronchitis" or "emphysema" and "influenza" and "vaccine*" were reviewed, and articles that potentially fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved in full as well as those that were doubtful. For the original review, three reviewers (PJP, RWB, EC) independently established whether each study met the inclusion criteria as an RCT of influenza vaccination in COPD with suitable outcome measures. For the update this was done by two reviewers (PJP, EC). Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers.</P>

<P>Data extraction sheets were of a format agreed by the three reviewers. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, and entered by one reviewer onto data extraction sheets before being entered into RevMan 4.0.4. Each entry was double-checked by a second reviewer. Versions of this review published after the 2005 update have been performed using Review Manager 5.</P>

<P>Only RCTs were included. For continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio was used. If there had been significant heterogeneity, we had intended to conduct a sensitivity analysis using study quality as a categorising variable.</P>
<P>It had been anticipated that the follow up period would be 12 months. Because of the small number of studies involved in this review, we did not annualise the event rate. If further studies become available, it may be necessary to annualise the event rate, particularly if follow-up periods vary.</P>

<P>We screened 105 abstracts of papers from the initial searches. After excluding those that were clearly ineligible we obtained full texts for 25 of them. An additional 40 articles were identified from bibliographies and references provided by pharmaceutical companies. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories provided us with another 70 references from an independent search. Full text articles were obtained when the title and abstract indicated the study was possibly eligible. A total of 70 full texts were read by the reviewers.</P>
<P>The 2003 search revealed four new abstracts, yielding two reports of the same eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neuzil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neuzil 2003</LINK>). The 2004 search revealed a further five abstracts, yielding two reports of the same eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>). Dr Wongsurakiat told us of a further study <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004_x002f_2" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004/2</LINK> published after our search. The main reasons for study exclusion were a lack of randomisation and absence of primary outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lama-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lama 1998</LINK>).

The studies that meet the inclusion criteria of this review have been identified from literature searches up to May 2006. No new eligible studies have been identified from literature searches conducted between 2007 and 2010.</P>

<P>Eleven studies met the entry criteria. All were randomised, controlled studies using a parallel group design. All studies except two (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1995</LINK>) were double-blinded and placebo-controlled. These two studies were single-blinded and both the treatment and the control group were given intra-muscular inactivated vaccine. The treatment group received intranasal live attenuated vaccine in addition to the inactivated vaccine while the control group received intranasal placebo. Because these studies assessed the additional benefit of a second vaccine, in addition to the inactivated vaccine, they are assessed separately in this review.</P>
<P>Six of the 11 trials in this review studied COPD or chronic bronchitis subjects alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>). These studies ranged in size from 29 (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>) to 2215 (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>), making a total of 2469 subjects. The other five trials were conducted in elderly and/or chronically ill subjects of whom a proportion had chronic lung disease. In these studies, the percentage of subjects with chronic lung diseases varied from 32% in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1995</LINK> to 5% in <LINK REF="STD-Cate-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Cate 1977</LINK>. From these authors, we sought individual patient data for the subgroup with chronic lung disease, in particular COPD. Where possible, data from the lung disease subgroup are included, although in none of these studies was it possible to ascertain whether this lung disease subgroup had COPD. The studies that included a minority of patients with chronic lung disease are described in the discussion section for comparison with the six studies carried out in exclusively COPD patients.</P>
<P>The following descriptions refer only to the six studies specifically investigating influenza vaccination in COPD or chronic bronchitics alone:</P>
<P>Timings: Three studies were conducted during winter months (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Settings: One was in a group practice (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>) and four in hospital outpatient clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Duration: This varied from as little as three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK>) to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inclusion and Exclusion criteria: <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> studied patients with chronic bronchitis. <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>; specifically studied patients with pre-existing COPD categorised by FEV1/FVC% &lt; 70%. Exclusion criteria were varied. They were explicit in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK> but limited to Grade 4 bronchitics in <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> and were not reported at all in <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>.</P>
<P>Patient Characteristics: the patients' mean age was 67.3 years in the five studies that reported it (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>). The percentage of males ranged from 64% (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>) to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>). The latter was a study in US veterans.</P>
<P>Co-morbidities: 31% of the treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK> had underlying liver disease. Both treatment and control groups in this study had similar proportions of other underlying diseases. 30% of the treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> were on digoxin and 8% had coexistent asthma and chronic bronchitis. In <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>, 95% had co morbidities, and in <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> this was 33%.</P>
<P>Smoking history: 97% of the participants of <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK> had a smoking history, 93% in <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>, 95% in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> and 96% in <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Lung Function: The mean peak flow was 280 L/min from the two studies that reported these measurements. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> stratified the participants in the study by baseline FEV1. Thirty-six per cent of subjects had FEV1 &gt;= 70% predicted, 26% FEV1 50%-69%, and 38% an FEV1 &lt; 50%. The mean baseline FEV1 in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> was 1.38 L (43.5% predicted).</P>
<P>The treatment and control populations were generally well matched, except in <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> where baseline adverse symptoms were higher in the vaccinated group. This particular study was unusual in that it used the early post vaccination symptoms as the baseline for assessing late post vaccination symptoms. In this study, despite randomisation, there was a significant difference between treatment and control in "baseline" symptom scores, serum antibody levels and co-morbidities. No details of baseline characteristics were provided by one study (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vaccination Type: Two studies used inactivated virus (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>). Four studies assessed the effects of live attenuated intranasal virus vaccines (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK>;) with <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> assessing the add-on benefit of live intranasal virus since both treatment and control groups received inactivated virus vaccine intramuscularly. These studies are examined separately in the analysis.</P>
<P>Match between vaccine and influenza strains: <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> reported that their study was carried out in a non-epidemic year. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> reported their study was carried out in a non-epidemic year, however there was a good match between the influenza that did occur and the serotypes in the vaccine. <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> reported a regional outbreak in the study area, with a virus antigenically similar to a vaccine strain. The other studies did not report the match.</P>
<P>Outcome Measures: Clinical outcomes that could be evaluated included: exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>), hospitalisations, lung function, adverse effects and mortality. An assessment of serological outcomes alone was not the purpose of this review. Outcomes were defined as "early" and "late" to try and address whether vaccination led to an increase in exacerbations before immunity had developed. We had planned to define "early" as 1-2 weeks after vaccination, but <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> used a period of three weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>, four weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> recorded all Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) (total of 269 events) which were then subdivided by presentation into common cold (85 events), influenza-like illnesses (20 events), acute exacerbations (161 events), and pneumonia (three events). Thus the commonest presentation was "acute exacerbation" (60% of events). He also conducted an economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2003</LINK>). Health status as assessed by the chronic lung disease index (CLDI) was reported by vaccination status in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>Dropouts: There was a range of 0% to 19% of participant withdrawals. There were none reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 1997</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1980</LINK> multi-centre study, 16 patients from one centre had no baseline data and 15 had incomplete records. In the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>) with 2215 subjects, 9% of patients dropped out. In <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>, three out of 125 subjects dropped out.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-06-23 08:56:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Influenza vaccination versus placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies in COPD / chronic bronchitis patients (both using inactivated virus vaccination) reported continuous data for exacerbation rates (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>). Vaccination significantly reduced the number of exacerbations per patient during the follow up period (WMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.11, P = 0.006). It was possible to determine the number of early or late exacerbations per patient by further interpretation of the data. For the placebo group of <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> 20 patients experienced 24 exacerbations. Since there were eight patients experiencing early exacerbations there would have been at least eight early exacerbations. Similarly, since there were 12 patients experiencing late exacerbations, there would have been at least 12 late exacerbations. Thus the assumption was made that in order to make up the total of 24 exacerbations, there were two more early and two more late exacerbations. In support of this conclusion is the statement in the paper that similar numbers of early exacerbations were recorded in both placebo and vaccinated groups. Sensitivity analysis using 12 early and 12 late exacerbations showed no difference in the significance of our results. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> provided the number of early and late exacerbations without a spread. As the number of early exacerbations was small it was assumed that these occurred in separate patients, and the SD calculated accordingly. We allocated the SD of the "total exacerbations'' per patient provided by the author to the "late exacerbations".</P>
<P>While there was no statistically significant effect of vaccination on early exacerbation rates (WMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.13, P = 0.87), inactivated influenza vaccination significantly reduced late exacerbation rates (WMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.18, P = 0.0004).</P>
<P>The two studies each assessed the clinical presentations to see if they were related to influenza virus infection. Howells used serology (HAI test) and Wongsurakiat used both serology (HI) and virology swabs. Overall, inactivated influenza vaccination resulted in a marked decrease in influenza-related respiratory infections (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.48, P = 0.0005). The effect was similar whether in patients with mild, moderate and severe COPD, or chronic bronchitis (test for heterogeneity P = 0.73). Influenza accounted for 8% (13/161) of the acute exacerbations in the Wongsurakiat study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> reported no difference in the incidence or severity of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) overall between the vaccination and placebo groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Patients with at least one exacerbation / acute respiratory illness in the study period</HEADING>
<P>Three studies contributed to this outcome. There was no difference between vaccination and placebo-treated subjects with respect to the number of patients having at least one exacerbation or acute respiratory illness (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.62, P = 0.7). There was, however, significant heterogeneity in this result (P = 0.001), so it must be treated with caution. A sensitivity analysis by vaccine type shows that if only the two studies that used inactivated virus vaccine are included this heterogeneity is removed. There is a significant reduction in the number of patients with at least one exacerbation or acute respiratory illness in the study period with vaccination (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.85, P = 0.02).</P>
<P>Results from <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> showed no significant difference in the number of individual patients with early exacerbations, but it did show a significant reduction in the number of patients with late exacerbations (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.45, P = 0.002). In <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> there was a total of 76 exacerbations in the vaccination group and 85 in the placebo group, of which 9 and 10 respectively were early exacerbations. We have assumed that they each occurred in a different patient. Clearly, over the course of the study there were some patients who had more than one exacerbation, and the numbers of individual patients in each group who had late exacerbations was not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hospitalisations</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported data on this outcome. There is no significant effect of vaccination over placebo on hospitalisation (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.24, P = 0.52). In <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> there were no hospitalised subjects in the treatment group, and only two in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> reported the number of hospitalisations for influenza-related respiratory infections only. There were two in the vaccine group and five in the placebo group. They reported no difference in the severity of acute respiratory infections between groups, including no difference in the chance of being hospitalised (P = 0.2 by log rank test). None of the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory infection, whereas five in the placebo group did.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Mortality</HEADING>

<LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> reported early (within two weeks of vaccination) upper respiratory tract symptoms. One vaccinated patient also developed pleuritic pain. There was no difference between vaccinated and control patients in terms of breathlessness and tightness (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.31, P = 0.696), cough (OR 4.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 22.49, P = 0.106), or sputum production (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.48 to 8.66, P = 0.338). The occurrence of wheeze within the first two weeks was greater in vaccinated patients (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.56, P = 0.034). Breathlessness was recorded significantly less often (P &lt; 0.05) in the 5 of 21 patients who had a serological response to vaccination than in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004_x002f_2" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004/2</LINK> evaluated local and systemic symptoms in the weeks following vaccination. There was no significant difference in the incidence of acute respiratory infection, or dyspnoea between the treated and placebo groups either at one or four weeks.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Treanor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Treanor 1994</LINK> 12% of the elderly patients vaccinated with live attenuated virus reported systemic symptoms of malaise and myalgias as did 10% of inactivated virus vaccinees.

Six per cent of live virus vaccinees experienced fever as did 2.5% of the inactivated virus vaccinees. None of the placebo group had any febrile illness. In the subgroup of patients with chronic lung disease in this study, the patients who received some form of influenza vaccination (n = 20) had a total of 20 adverse effects in 11 patients, and in the placebo recipients (n = 2), there were two adverse effects in one patient.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1993</LINK> 25% of high risk vaccinees experienced one or more adverse reactions compared to 16% of placebo recipients, however effects if any appeared to have been mild and transitory. Eleven percent of all vaccinees experienced systemic effects as did 9.4% of the placebo recipients. When a multiple regression analysis that looked at the effect of lung disease on systemic adverse reactions was performed, the difference between vaccinees and the placebo group was statistically significant (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.07). Local effects were experienced by 17.5% of all vaccinees in this study, but in only 7.3% of the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cost effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2003</LINK> calculated the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of inactivated virus vaccination by applying the direct medical costs from a Thai health provider perspective to the results obtained in the RCT published by <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>. There were two types of cost: cost of treatment as an outpatient, and cost of hospitalisation. More than 90% of the costs of influenza-related ARI were costs of hospitalisation. In patients with moderate or severe COPD, more than 90% of the hospital costs were due to costs of treating those who required mechanical ventilation. The costs were based on 1997 prices, with vaccination costing 248.40 baht. He concluded that for every 100 patients with mild, moderate, or severe COPD vaccinated, the cost savings would be 125,629, 538,184 and 680,647 baht respectively, i.e. vaccination was very cost effective, but more so in those with more severe COPD.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review evaluates the few RCTs that have been reported on the effects of influenza vaccination in people with COPD. Despite exhaustive searches, only 15 reports (from 11 studies) were identified that met inclusion criteria, with only six of these having been performed solely on subjects with COPD or chronic bronchitis. The entry criteria for these studies were variously reported but, where reported, they showed that the majority of patients had a smoking history and airways obstruction. The earlier studies enrolled younger subjects than the more recent studies. The other studies in the review were of elderly and /or chronically ill patients of whom a subset had chronic lung disease. There was a total of 2469 subjects in the six COPD or chronic bronchitis trials.</P>
<P>In the original Cochrane review in 2001 we wrote "the strong recommendations in current guidelines make it ethically difficult now to conduct large, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of influenza vaccination, even though it would appear desirable to do so". Interestingly, and without our knowledge, such a trial had been conducted but not reported at the time (<LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>). The authors believed the study to be justified on the grounds that prior to 1997, influenza vaccine had been unavailable in Thailand. This study of inactivated influenza vaccination tracked 125 patients over one year following vaccination, with only three dropouts. An analysis with the results from another carefully conducted RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>) shows that inactivated influenza vaccine significantly reduces COPD exacerbations with an effectiveness ((1-RR) x 100%) of over 60%. Moreover, inactivated influenza vaccination has an effectiveness of over 80% in reducing influenza-related acute respiratory infections (ARIs).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of vaccination is confined to late exacerbations i.e. those occurring more than three to four weeks after vaccination. The investigators chose to study this time period specifically in order to allow time for immunity to develop. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> and others make the point that the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing exacerbations will depend on how much influenza-related ARI is present, i.e. whether there is an epidemic or not. <LINK REF="STD-Fell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fell 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> were conducted in non-epidemic years, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> was undertaken in an epidemic year. Influenza virus caused 8% of the 'acute exacerbation' and 10% of the 'influenza-like illness' presentations in <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>, but was responsible for 37% of the acute exacerbations in <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK>. </P>
<P>To further emphasise this point, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Howells-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Howells 1961</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK> are both consistent with one large (n = 1906), high quality RCT trial (<LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>) conducted on elderly patients, 9% of whom had chronic lung disease. It assessed the effect of inactivated influenza virus vaccination on the development of influenza or influenza-like illnesses. When such illnesses were diagnosed by clinical assessment, the relative risk for influenza-related illness was 0.53 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.73). When the diagnosis was made using the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-Defined), the relative risk was 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05). However, post hoc analysis showed that during an epidemic, the relative risk for influenza-related illness diagnosed by clinical assessment was 0.41 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.61) and by ICHPPC-2-Defined criteria was 0.74 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.00). This study also demonstrated an overall halving of influenza risk by vaccination. Results for subgroups of those patients at high risk (including those with lung conditions) and those over the age of 70 years were not statistically significant but the numbers in each group were small. In <LINK REF="STD-Treanor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Treanor 1994</LINK>, a study of elderly patients who were in institutions where laboratory-documented outbreaks of influenza A occurred, only 8% of the treatment group compared to 20% of the controls had respiratory illness. Similarly, only 4% of the treatment group compared to 11% of the control group experienced an influenza-like illness. Inactivated influenza vaccination is likely to have an even greater effect in epidemic years than seen in this review. </P>
<P>Even though the number of RCTs (and patients) is relatively small, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination seen in this review is consistent with that seen in large observational studies. In one of these, in 1900 elderly subjects with chronic lung disease, those vaccinated had a halving of the risk of hospitalisation for pneumonia, and a 70% reduction in the risk of death during influenza seasons (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1999</LINK>). A meta analysis of 20 cohort studies of influenza vaccination in the elderly showed a 56% reduction in respiratory illness and a 50% reductions in hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1995</LINK>). Most of these studies had been conducted in epidemic years. </P>
<P>Because of the risk of influenza and the lesser immunogenicity of vaccines in the elderly (including COPD patients), there is interest in the extra protection afforded by the addition of live attenuated virus to inactivated virus vaccination. This approach to clinical trial design has the advantage that high-risk groups are not denied vaccination, but larger numbers of patients are needed if the study is to have sufficient power to detect an effect. The studies in this review show that there was no greater protective effect of live plus inactivated vaccine over inactivated vaccine alone in any of the clinical outcomes of interest. On the other hand, there may be a slight increase in adverse effects with the combination, although this was seen only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK>) and the investigators did not regard it as significant.</P>
<P>One of the main barriers to increasing vaccination rates in COPD patients is the concern of both health professionals and patients that vaccination may increase early exacerbations before immunity has developed. The evidence in this review shows that inactivated virus vaccination does not have a significant effect on the number, or the number of patients with early exacerbations or early acute respiratory illnesses. </P>
<P>Influenza vaccinations were generally well tolerated. There was a significant increase in local effects ranging from pain at the site of injection, to erythema with or without induration but all effects appear to be mild and transitory. These findings are consistent with results from a large, well conducted randomised placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 1994</LINK>) of influenza vaccination in healthy adults where no significant side effects of vaccination were observed, except for arm soreness (63.8% of vaccinees compared to 24.1% placebo, P = 0.001). </P>
<P>There is no evidence of any significant effect on hospitalisations, mortality rates, lung function decline or exercise tolerance between the vaccine and placebo groups. For the infrequent outcomes of hospitalisation and mortality, the studies are probably too small to show any difference. Interestingly one subject in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Gorse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gorse 2003</LINK> developed Guillain Barre syndrome, although further details of severity and outcome were not provided. </P>
<P>We did not intend to evaluate serological outcomes such as a significant rise in antibody titre in this review. However, some authors looked at outcomes in the subgroup with a serological response to vaccination. The limited data from these comparisons is consistent with that of the clinical outcomes alone. It also suggests that if subjects seroconvert, they have fewer adverse effects. </P>
<P>Two authors (<LINK REF="STD-Neuzil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neuzil 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>) studied the clinical presentation of symptomatic laboratory-documented influenza (LDI). <LINK REF="STD-Neuzil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Neuzil 2003</LINK> found, using stepwise logistic regression, that during an influenza outbreak period, only fever and myalgia were associated with LDI. Together they had a positive predictive value of 41%. In <LINK REF="STD-Wongsurakiat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wongsurakiat 2004</LINK>, the most specific presentation of LDI was "influenza-like illness" (namely generalised aches, fever, headache +/- respiratory tract symptoms). LDI occurred in only 10% of these patients, however, indicating a low positive predictive value of this symptom complex for LDI. The conclusion is that it is difficult to diagnose influenza infection clinically with certainty in patients with COPD. </P>
<P>The one cost effectiveness analysis that has been conducted based on an RCT suggests that inactivated virus vaccination is highly cost effective in COPD patients, particularly those with severe airways obstruction. This analysis took into account direct health care costs only and not indirect costs, or any future health care costs that might be incurred by COPD patients living longer. It was conducted in a non-epidemic year, and therefore will underestimate the benefits that would be gained in an epidemic year. <BR/>Methodological limitations </P>
<P>The main issue is that there are few RCTs of influenza vaccinations in COPD and data were generally not reported in the same way. However, the studies that were found were of satisfactory quality (8/11 studies had Jadad scores of 3 or more out of 5). The effects observed in RCTS are internally consistent, biologically plausible, and supported by observational studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is RCT evidence that inactivated influenza vaccination has a clinically important and significant effect on influenza-related exacerbations, and probably an effect on the total of exacerbations in COPD patients. This effect is likely to be greater in epidemic years when the proportion of exacerbations due to influenza will be higher. The size of the effect is similar to those seen in cohort studies and there is no evidence that inactivated virus vaccination causes exacerbations. The addition of intranasal live attenuated virus does not confer any added benefit. </P>
<P>There are significantly more local side-effects reported with intramuscular influenza vaccine than with placebo, however these effects are self limiting and are far outweighed by the longer term benefits of the vaccination. </P>
<P>To reduce exacerbations in COPD overall will require a combination of approaches, including vaccination, as only a small percentage are caused by influenza virus.<BR/>In COPD patients symptomatic influenza infections are difficult to diagnose clinically with any certainty. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The evidence of effectiveness of influenza from observational studies has been viewed by many as sufficient for the strong recommendations in COPD guidelines. These studies may be biased, as there are potentially many differences between those who volunteer to be vaccinated and those who don't. Only some of the biases can be controlled for. These strong recommendations are now supported by some good quality RCT data. It is ethically difficult to conduct further large, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of influenza vaccination, even though it would appear desirable to do so. Any planned study would need to be large since the incidence of influenza is low (particularly in non-epidemic years) and vaccine efficacy is less than 100% in the elderly. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination is best determined during epidemic years with a good match between vaccine and circulating strains, yet this is not known until the influenza season starts, by which time trials have started. For studies conducted during non-epidemic times, results from patients who seroconvert may be used as a surrogate to determine the effectiveness of immunisation, however clinical outcomes need to be reported, particularly if cost effectiveness is to be studied. </P>
<P>There is still not enough data from large enough RCTs to determine the effect of vaccination on rarer events in the trial period, such as hospitalisation or mortality. <BR/>
<BR/>Measures of health status should be built in to clinical studies of COPD as a matter of course. </P>
<P>Public health and policy approaches to increasing vaccine uptake need studying and incorporation into a systematic review; as do public heath and other approaches to reducing the impact of influenza outbreaks. Studies should continue to look at ways to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine, or combination of vaccines. This might include adding in new vaccine types while administering the recommended inactivated virus vaccine, or conducting short term placebo-controlled studies, at the end of which all placebo recipients are vaccinated. </P>

The proportion of<BR/>men in the vaccinated group was 57% but 70% in the control. Smoking histories were similar. <BR/>Randomisation was unsuccessful in a number of areas; symptom scores of first 2 weeks after vaccination were used. The vaccinated group had greater symptom reports (not statistically significant) and lower Mean Peak Expiratory Flow-Rates. 19% of the vaccinated group had histories of asthma and 30% were on digoxin at entry, while none in the control had either. Over 60% of the vaccinated group had circulating HAI antibody against the WRL105 strain before vaccination while less than 35% of the control did. <BR/>Co-morbidities: Past history of asthma in 19% and use of Digoxin in 30 % of vaccinated.<BR/>Diagnostic criteria: chronic bronchitis; 3 months productive cough annually for 3 years, MRC questionnaire completed.

<P>Setting: Winter 1960, NW Wolverhampton.<BR/>Number: 55 enrolled; 26 in vaccinated group, 29 in control. <BR/>Characteristics: 37 men ( 67%) of average age 52.78 (SD 12.51)years; overall average Peak Expiratory Flow was 270.09 (SD111.88) l/min. The overall Maximum Breathing Capacity was 64.33 (SD 30.59) l/min.<BR/>Baseline characteristics:<BR/>The average age of the vaccinated group was 54.08 (SD14)years and the control was 51.62 (SD11.12)years. 58% of the vaccinated group was male and 76% of the control. The vaccinated patients had an average duration of symptoms of around 17 years, while the control had around 20 years. The average Peak Expiratory Flow for the vaccinated group was 266.35(SD101.12) l/min and 273.45(SD120.29) l/min for the control. This difference could be attributed to the 2 asthmatics who had relatively higher peak flows. The average Maximum Breathing Capacity for the vaccinated group was 62.81(SD28.66) l/min and 65.75(SD32.75) l/min for the control. Comparable antibody levels to influenza viruses in all patients.<BR/>Co-morbidities: 7% of control were asthmatics.<BR/>Diagnostic Criteria: Chronic Bronchitis; " a minimum of 3 years' history of cough with phlegm on most days for at least 3 months of the year..."

</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>We made an assumption for the number of early and late exacerbations per patient for the placebo group. We knew the total number of exacerbations was 24 experienced by 20 patients out of 29. Thus, there would have been at least 8 and 10 exacerbations for early and late respectively according to the numbers of patients experiencing exacerbations in the placebo group. We added 2 exacerbations to each group to make up the total of 24. We felt justified in doing so because the study stated that similar numbers of early exacerbations were recorded in both groups, which was the case using our assumption.</P>
