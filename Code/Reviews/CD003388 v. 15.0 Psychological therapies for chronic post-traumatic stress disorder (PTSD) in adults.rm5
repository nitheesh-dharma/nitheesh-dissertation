<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:59:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur following a traumatic event. It is characterised by symptoms of re-experiencing the trauma (in the form of nightmares, flashbacks and distressing thoughts), avoiding reminders of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, and symptoms of hyper-arousal (feeling on edge, being easily startled, feeling angry, having difficulties sleeping, and problems concentrating).</P>
<P>Previous reviews have supported the use of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of PTSD. TFCBT is a variant of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which includes a number of techniques to help a person overcome a traumatic event. It is a combination of cognitive therapy aimed at changing the way a person thinks, and behavioural therapy, which aims to change the way a person acts. TFCBT helps an individual come to terms with a trauma through exposure to memories of the event. EMDR is a psychological therapy, which aims to help a person reprocess their memories of a traumatic event. The therapy involves bringing distressing trauma-related images, beliefs, and bodily sensations to mind, whilst the therapist guides eye movements from side to side. More positive views of the trauma memories are identified, with the aim of replacing the ones that are causing problems.</P>
<P>TFCBT and EMDR are currently recommended as the treatments of choice by guidelines such as those published by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> This review draws together up-to-date evidence from 70 studies including a total of 4761 people.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings:</B> There is continued support for the efficacy of individual TFCBT, EMDR, non-TFCBT and group TFCBT in the treatment of chronic PTSD in adults. Other non-trauma-focused psychological therapies did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are equally effective immediately post-treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non-TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. No specific conflicts of interest were identified.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> Although we included a substantial number of studies in this review, each only included small numbers of people and some were poorly designed. We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low and so the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not psychological therapy is harmful.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-20 09:16:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-29 09:44:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non-trauma-focused CBT (non-TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non-directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present-centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non-TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician-rated traumatic-stress symptoms.</P>

<P>We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:13:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.62; 95% CI -2.03 to -1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD -1.17; 95% CI -2.04 to -0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post-treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non-TFCBT at follow-up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non-TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop-out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-20 09:38:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are equally effective immediately post-treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non-TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow-up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long-term effects of psychological treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-20 09:52:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a well recognised psychiatric disorder that occurs following a major traumatic event. Characteristic symptoms include re-experiencing phenomena such as nightmares and recurrent distressing thoughts of the event, avoidance of talking or being reminded of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, and hyperarousal symptoms including sleep disturbance, increased irritability and hypervigilance. PTSD can be diagnosed after a one-month duration of symptoms. The condition is considered chronic once symptoms have been present for three months. PTSD is a relatively common condition. The National Co-morbidity Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1995</LINK>) found that 7.8% of 5877 American adults had suffered from PTSD at some time in their lives. When data were examined from individuals who had been exposed to a traumatic event, rates of PTSD varied according to the type of stressor. For example, physical assaults amongst women led to a lifetime prevalence of 29% and combat experience amongst men to a lifetime prevalence of 39%.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-29 09:55:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychological therapies have been advocated as being effective in the treatment of PTSD since its conception. Various forms of psychological therapy have been used including exposure therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Creamer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creamer 2004</LINK>), cognitive therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ehlers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ehlers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resick 1992</LINK>), psychodynamic psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Brom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brom 1989</LINK>) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1989b</LINK>). Exposure therapy usually involves asking the participant to relive the trauma imaginally. This is often done by creating a detailed present tense account of exactly what happened, making an audio tape recording or transcript of it and asking the individual to listen to/read this over and over again. Another form of exposure therapy involves exposing participants to cues associated with the traumatic event (for example, graded re-exposure to car travel following a road traffic accident). Trauma-focused cognitive therapy involves helping the individual to identify distorted thinking patterns regarding themselves, the traumatic incident and the world. Individuals are encouraged to challenge their thoughts by weighing up available evidence and through the utilisation of various techniques by the therapist, including specific questioning that leads the individual to challenge distorted views. EMDR involves the PTSD sufferer focusing on a traumatic image, thought, emotion and a bodily sensation whilst receiving bilateral stimulation, most commonly in the form of eye movements. Non-TFCBT usually focuses on techniques for the reduction of anxiety. The most widely used protocol for anxiety reduction in PTSD is stress inoculation training (SIT), which teaches skills for managing stress, such as relaxation, thought stopping and guided dialogue. It provides the opportunity to practise acquired skills gradually, across a variety of settings. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on integrating the traumatic experience into the life experience of the individual as a whole; childhood issues are often felt to be important.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 15:49:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The psychological therapies considered by this review stem from various theoretical perspectives. Individual protocols describe how therapies might work in detail. TFCBT protocols draw on four core components emphasised in varying degrees: 1) psycho-education; 2) anxiety management; 3) exposure; and 4) cognitive restructuring. Earlier therapies tended to be more behaviourally based, focusing heavily on exposure work. Cognitive components have become more prominent over time, in line with the popularity of information processing accounts of the disorder. Exposure plays an important role in many TFCBT protocols.  It may be carried out in vivo (real life), or imaginally. It is common for both to be used in the treatment of PTSD, to target internally and externally feared stimuli. The rationale behind the use of imaginal exposure varies according to the specific TFCBT protocol. Imaginal exposure is based on principles of habituation (the reduction of anxiety after prolonged exposure) or information processing (allowing re-evaluation of old information and incorporation of new information into the trauma memory), or a combination of both. In addition, cognitive restructuring has an important role, seeking to identify and modify dysfunctional thoughts by testing and challenging self-held beliefs, based on the assumption that these usually unquestioned thoughts are distorted or unhelpful. EMDR is an integrative trauma-focused therapy encompassing elements from various effective psychotherapies in a structured protocol drawn from an information processing model of PTSD. There is no agreed mechanism by which EMDR is thought to operate. <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1989b</LINK> discovered EMDR accidentally. Her account implicates personal experience of rapid eye movements easing distress. On the basis of this experience, Shapiro elaborated EMDR for the treatment of Vietnam war veterans and abuse sufferers. It is suggested that bilateral stimulation aids the processing of traumatic memories. Non-TFCBT interventions such as SIT operate by teaching the individuals techniques to minimise and control their anxiety. In terms of other psychological therapies considered by this review, psychodynamic psychotherapy places emphasis on the unconscious mind, aiming to resolve inner conflict arising from the traumatic event. Person-centred therapy/supportive counselling allows the individual to talk through problems and resolve difficulties with minimal guidance and direction from the therapist. The therapist is accepting and non-judgemental. This style encourages the individual to feel comfortable in the expression of feelings, facilitating positive change. Unlike trauma-focused therapies, person-centred/supportive counselling does not encourage exploration of the trauma memory.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:14:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is apparent that PTSD causes clinically significant suffering and that developing effective interventions is important. Earlier versions of this review and other meta-analyses have found psychological therapies to be effective (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2005</LINK>), with trauma-focused treatments being more effective than non-trauma-focused treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007a</LINK>). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007, bringing together current evidence concerning the psychological treatment of chronic PTSD in adults. Other Cochrane Collaboration reviews have considered single-session psychological 'debriefing' to prevent PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>), multiple-session early psychological interventions for the prevention of PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>), early psychological therapies to treat acute traumatic stress symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2010</LINK>), pharmacological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2006</LINK>), combined pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies for PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2010</LINK>), and psychological therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2012</LINK>).</P>

<B>The Cochrane, Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 33,000 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of OVID MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-20 14:07:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed all included studies for risk of bias, using the standard approach described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This considered (1) sequence allocation for randomisation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of personnel and assessors; (4) incomplete outcome data; (5) selective reporting; and (6) any other notable risks of bias. Each was judged to pose a 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' risk of bias. Two review authors conducted the assessments, discussing any disagreements with a third review author to reach a consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Sequence allocation randomisation</B>
</P>
<P>Randomisation was judged as posing a 'low' risk of bias if each participant had an equal chance of being randomised to a group. Low-risk methods included referring to a random number table, use of a computerised random number generator, shuffling sealed envelopes or throwing a dice. Methods judged as posing a 'high' risk of bias included use of a sequence generated by e.g. date of birth, clinic number, date of admission to the study, or allocation by availability of the intervention. When insufficient information was given to permit judgement of high or low risk of bias, we describe the study as being at an 'unclear' risk of bias attributable to sequence allocation.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Allocation concealment </B>
</P>
<P>Concealment of intervention allocation was said to be at 'low' risk when there was no chance of the investigator foreseeing a participant's assignment. Methods judged as posing a low risk of bias included central allocation (e.g. by telephone or the internet) or sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. High-risk methods included alternation or rotation of assignment or using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers). When insufficient information was reported to permit judgement of high or low risk, we describe the study as being at an 'unclear' risk of bias attributable to allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Blinding of personnel and assessors</B>
</P>
<P>It is not possible to blind either the participants or those administering psychological interventions. However, outcome assessors can be blinded. Those studies which blinded assessors were deemed to be at a low risk of bias, those which did not were judged as being at a high risk of bias. When insufficient information was reported to permit judgement of high or low risk, we describe the study as being at an 'unclear' risk of bias attributable to blinding.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Incomplete outcome data</B>
</P>
<P>We judged incomplete data to have been handled appropriately when reported completely, including attrition rates and exclusions, with consideration of the issue in terms of analysing the data. Low risk of bias was associated with no missing outcome data, or the use of data imputed using appropriate methods. Methods judged as posing a high risk of bias included analyses that considered only the data of treatment-completers, or potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation. When insufficient information was reported to permit judgement of high or low risk, we describe the study as being at an 'unclear' risk of bias attributable to incomplete data.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Selective reporting</B>
</P>
<P>We judged a study to be at a low risk of bias if a protocol was available and all prespecified outcomes were reported. If there was no available protocol, the study was assigned a low risk in this domain if it was clear that the published reports included all expected outcomes, including those prespecified. When insufficient information was reported to permit judgement of high or low risk, we describe the study as being at an 'unclear' risk of bias attributable to selective reporting.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>6. Other notable risks of bias</B>
</P>
<P>We noted any other potential threats to validity and judged them to be at a high or low risk of bias. We describe them as being at 'unclear' risk of bias when there was insufficient information to assess additional risk of bias.</P>

<P>If the trial had three (or more) arms, we undertook pair-wise meta-analysis with each arm, depending upon the nature of the intervention in each arm and the relevance to the review objectives. We avoided multiple comparisons as far as possible, to limit the risk of false positive results. When a study had three or more arms that were relevant to the review we considered the appropriateness of combining data from two arms if therapies were sufficiently similar or of using data from the arms of the trial which fit closest to the review objective.

<P>Drop-out rates were high in many of the studies and reasons for attrition were generally poorly reported.

<P>It was difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions with regards to the issue of selective reporting. Very few of the included studies had published protocols available. It was therefore impossible to know whether prespecified outcome measures were adequately reported. The majority of studies adequately reported all outcomes outlined within the Methods section of the trial report.</P>

<P>A strength of the majority of the studies was having clear objectives, but sample sizes were often small and the follow-up period was limited. The treatments delivered were reasonably well-described and the majority of studies reported on the credentials and experience of therapists. A high proportion of the included studies made some assessment of treatment adherence. Most studies used well-validated outcome measures although there was considerable variation in the actual measures used. For practical and ethical reasons there were rarely follow-up data available from waitlist groups. We could not rule out potential researcher allegiance in many of the studies. A number of the included trials were of interventions that were evaluated by their originators.<B>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">20.3 Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>All the studies identified for this review were published, and many of the trials were undertaken relatively recently. We explored the potential effects of publication bias using funnel plots. We constructed two funnel plots using data from the individual TFCBT versus waitlist/usual care comparison (comparison 1), one involving continuous data in the primary outcome, and the second involving dichotomous data in a secondary outcome. We also looked at the TFCBT versus 'other therapies' comparison (3.1).</P>
<P>The first funnel plot examined the measure of clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and was roughly symmetrical with the exception of one outlier and an absence of smaller studies demonstrating no difference or a difference in favour of waitlist/usual care. This suggests the possibility of publication bias. As the studies become less precise the results of the studies tended be more variable and scattered to either side of the more precise larger studies. The same was found for the comparison of TFCBT with other therapies (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The second funnel plot using data from the individual TFCBT versus waitlist/usual care comparison examined the dichotomous measure of PTSD diagnosis after treatment (see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). This funnel plot shows that larger studies demonstrated smaller differences between individual TFCBT and waitlist/usual care, and also suggests an absence of smaller studies demonstrating no difference or a difference in favour of waitlist/usual care. This funnel plot therefore shows some evidence of publication bias. It is possible that, due to the greater likelihood of publication of positive studies, the true difference between groups is smaller than is suggested by this review.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-13 11:10:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We include 70 studies of 4761 participants in this review. We have created a 'Summary of findings' table for each of the 13 comparisons we were able to conduct. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. Statistically, individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician-assessed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Non-TFCBT did significantly better than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies did significantly better than waitlist/usual care control, as did group-TFCBT. There was no difference between group non-TFCBT and waitlist/usual care. There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT immediately post-treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non-TFCBT at between one and four months following treatment, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. There was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. The considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy</HEADING>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that individual TFCBT was better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms and associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. The overall standardised mean difference for traumatic stress symptoms post-treatment represents an effect size generally accepted as indicating a strong positive effect. After exploration of heterogeneity this finding remains robust although there is statistically significant heterogeneity present in all analyses. There is not enough evidence to confirm whether this advantage is maintained over time. There is evidence that individual TFCBT is a more effective treatment than non-trauma-focused therapies classed as 'other therapies'. There is also evidence that individual TFCBT is superior to non-TFCBT, although this is not apparent immediately after treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing</HEADING>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that EMDR was better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms and additionally associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. The overall standardised mean differences for clinician-rated and self-rated traumatic stress symptoms post-treatment represents a strong positive effect size. There is not enough evidence to determine whether these improvements are maintained in the long-term as there were no follow-up comparisons of EMDR and waitlist groups. There were limited data to suggest a better outcome than non-TFCBT at between one- and four-month follow-up. EMDR appeared to have similar effectiveness to individual TFCBT in the studies that compared them directly. There was some evidence that EMDR was a more effective treatment than other therapies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Non-trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy</HEADING>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that non-TFCBT was better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms and additionally associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. It is worth noting that the meta-analyses of non-TFCBT included fewer participants than TFCBT and EMDR, and demonstrated high heterogeneity, indicating that these results should be interpreted with caution. There was some evidence that non-TFCBT is a more effective treatment than other non-trauma-focused therapies, but this was from the results of one study only. Non-TFCBT was less effective than TFCBT at follow-up. Whilst this might indicate insufficient statistical power, it may also indicate that non-TFCBT provides only temporary relief of symptoms, or that TFCBT provides a basis for continued improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other therapies</HEADING>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that other therapies were better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms and associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. As stated above, other therapies were statistically significantly worse in terms of the primary outcome measure of reducing traumatic stress symptoms when directly compared with individual TFCBT and non-TFCBT. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of other therapies in comparison with individual TFCBT in terms of drop-out. This finding suggests the possibility of non-trauma-focused therapies being easier to tolerate than individual TFCBT, although this finding is based on studies of variable quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Group TFCBT</HEADING>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that group TFCBT was better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms. There was no difference between group TFCBT and non-trauma-focused group CBT.</P>
<P>
<B>Group non-TFCBT</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence that group non-TFCBT was any better than waitlist/usual care in reducing traumatic stress symptoms or depression immediately after treatment or at four-month follow-up in the one study making this comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Drop-outs</HEADING>
<P>Individual TFCBT and other therapies both did worse than waitlist/usual care on this outcome measure. There was also some evidence that individual TFCBT incurred a greater drop-out rate than other therapies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Unfortunately no studies reported adverse effects. It is well recognised that these may occur, such as increased re-experiencing following exposure treatment (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Pitman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitman 1991</LINK>), and the absence of any reporting of them is of major concern.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Anxiety and depression</HEADING>
<P>Symptoms of anxiety and depression generally improved in line with improvements in traumatic stress symptoms. This is no surprise for treatments such as cognitive restructuring where many of the approaches used for PTSD would also be used for anxiety and depression. However other treatments such as exposure therapy do not address depressive symptoms per se yet still appeared to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms. This suggests that the anxiety and depressive symptoms found in many PTSD sufferers in these studies were secondary to the PTSD rather than being discrete conditions requiring specific treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The forest plots of the pooled results demonstrated statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies. For example, heterogeneity levels of P &lt; 0.00001 were observed in several analyses of the primary outcome measure. There are likely to be several factors that contribute to this heterogeneity. There is clearly considerable clinical diversity within the studies considered. We attempted to explore this by performing subgroup analyses on the primary outcome measure of individual TFCBT versus waitlist/usual care. Those studies including only women, all of whom had been sexually or non-sexually assaulted, produced more positive results than the overall results. Possible explanations include the treatments having been superior, women being more responsive to individual TFCBT than men, traumatisation by assault being more responsive to individual TFCBT, a combination of these and/or other factors. Those studies that did not include only Vietnam war veterans produced a slightly more positive result than all studies. However there was only one study excluded from this subgroup analysis, which may therefore lack power to show a real difference; great caution must be exercised in interpreting this finding.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:10:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review considers randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a wide range of psychological therapies for chronic PTSD, including individual TFCBT, EMDR, non-TFCBT, group TFCBT, group non-TFCBT, and other psychological therapies (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). Studies included participants from different countries and backgrounds, who had been exposed to a variety of different traumatic events (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>). The majority of studies reported on the use of qualified and experienced therapists, and a high proportion included assessment of adherence to a treatment protocol (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Many factors, however, limit the generalisability of conclusions reached by this review. Most studies to date have been conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia and Europe, limiting generalisability of results to the rest of the world. Although we have included the full range of psychological therapies for PTSD considered by RCTs to date, insufficient data preclude meta-analysis of a number of outcomes in some treatment groups. There are many more studies of individual TFCBT than other therapies, for example, those taking a person-centred only or psychodynamic approach, which were considered within a single category. The majority of studies did not include participants with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and substance dependence, excluding individuals who are arguably more difficult to treat. This may have resulted in the exclusion of individuals with complicated histories and the experience of multiple traumatic events. Generalising the results to more complex presentations of the disorder is therefore problematic. There were very limited long-term follow-up data, especially for waitlist groups. This prevents determination of the long-term efficacy of therapies, but the incremental improvement of the active treatment groups in the trials with longer follow-ups suggests that benefits are maintained. Comparison on the basis of trauma type, study setting and participant variables would be an interesting addition to future versions of this review.</P>
<P>Most studies reported on drop-outs by group; drop-out rates are likely to be influenced by adverse effects along with other factors. The major distinction between the treatments classed as TFCBT and those classed as 'other therapies' was the inclusion of exposure-based components. Since the treatments that included exposure had a significantly greater drop-out rate, this raises questions surrounding the tolerability of exposure work. Although it is well documented that exposure-based treatments can cause short-term exacerbation of symptoms (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Tarrier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tarrier 1999</LINK>), we have little understanding of how this impacts on drop-out rates. Given that the included studies provide little disclosure of adverse events and few explanations for drop-outs, it is difficult to ascertain why participants were less able to tolerate exposure-based treatments. This is an important finding and one that should stimulate the development of interventions that are more acceptable to those who receive them.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:12:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methodological quality varied considerably (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Risk of bias was high or unclear for multiple domains in a large proportion of older studies, especially those published before 2000. Most studies rated as having a low risk of bias were of individual TFCBT. In a large proportion of studies, the information provided by the published report was insufficient to determine the risk of bias associated with key methodological indicators. There was considerable unexplained heterogeneity for some analyses and the quality of evidence for each of the comparisons was rated as very low.</P>
<P>As with all psychological therapy trials, there are issues with the control groups. The development of a 'psychological therapy placebo' is very difficult, if not impossible, as is blinding of participants and therapists. It is possible that the efficacy of psychological therapies is stronger than suggested by the data, as in several studies the waitlist/usual care group received some contact and the expectation that they would be treated, which may have been therapeutic. It is, however, also possible that waitlist groups do worse than usual care groups because they do not expect to improve until they receive the active therapy.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-29 11:27:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review followed guidelines set out by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two authors independently read all the candidate studies, assessed them for inclusion, and rated them for risk of bias. We discussed any disagreements with a third review author with the aim of reaching a consensus. This will have minimised potential bias, but several unavoidable issues remain. For example, all studies included in the review were published, resulting in the possibility of publication bias. We explored and confirmed this using funnel plots (Figures 4, 5 and 6). Several studies reported incomplete data, although we contacted authors to obtain missing results where possible. Although we searched numerous online databases systematically, scrutinised reference lists, contacted experts in the field, and handsearched relevant additional sources, we cannot rule out the possibility of missed RCTs. There was a great deal of heterogeneity between trials of the psychological therapies included within specific categories. This was especially notable within the 'other therapies' group. Although all were examples of non-trauma-focused psychological therapies that were not based on the principles of CBT, interventions included psychodynamic therapy, hypnotherapy, supportive counselling and present-centred counselling, which differ in terms of proposed active ingredients and the way in which they are delivered. There was also considerable statistical heterogeneity evident in many of the comparisons. In circumstances where heterogeneity was thought to be an issue, we used a random-effects model, and reported this. In addition, therapies within the 'other therapies' category were not always delivered with the intention of being as effective as the other treatment under study, but to act as a control (e.g.<LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feske-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Feske 2008</LINK>). It is clear that TFCBT performed very well versus waitlist/usual care comparison, but it must also be considered that this comparison included by far the most studies. It is fair to say that other categories (e.g. other therapies) may have performed better had they been represented by a larger number of studies. Finally, it is worth noting that there were differences in terms of acceptance into treatment protocols (for example, the requirement of diagnosis through structured interview versus self-reported measures), which is likely to have resulted in some studies that were overly inclusive and others that exercised more conservative guidelines.</P>

<P>This review supports the efficacy of psychological therapy for chronic PTSD, which is consistent with the results of many other reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Etten-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Etten 1988</LINK>). It is also consistent with current practice guidelines which recommend individual TFCBT and EMDR as frontline treatments for the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-ACPMH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACPMH 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>).</P>

<OL>
<LI>Psychological therapies are more effective than waitlist or usual care in treating adults with chronic PTSD.</LI>
<LI>Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing have the best evidence for efficacy at present.</LI>
<LI>There is evidence that non-TFCBT is effective in the short term.</LI>
<LI>There is more limited evidence that some other non-trauma-focused psychological therapies may be effective.</LI>
<LI>Drop-out from treatment is an issue with currently available psychological therapies. Issues of engagement are an important consideration.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow-up data, which compromise conclusions regarding the long-term effects of psychological treatment. We assessed the evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review as of very low quality.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Further well-designed trials of psychological therapies are required, incorporating appropriate methods of randomisation, blinding of assessors, long-term follow up and appropriate training of therapists and monitoring of treatment adherence.</LI>
<LI>There is a requirement for further comparison studies of one type of psychological therapy against another.</LI>
<LI>Future trials should consider adverse events and tolerability of treatment in more detail.</LI>
<LI>The role of psychological therapy in combination and as an alternative to medication is unclear. Further research in this area would be useful.</LI>

This was done in order to consolidate therapist skills in each protocol and offset cross-pollination of the two, different, therapeutic protocols. Subsequently, subjects were assigned alternatively to the two conditions until a full cohort was obtained in each condition."</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote: "Often, intention-to-treat analysis is performed by using an individual&#8217;s last measurement before treatment dropout as the last outcome or by carrying it forward. This method has been criticized for the bias it can introduce. Instead, we attempted to measure participants regardless of the number of treatment sessions they attended or their treatment dropout status. To our knowledge, no previous studies of PTSD treatment have taken this approach, which is standard in clinical trials in other fields of medicine. Therefore, we also performed secondary analyses to examine the effect of TFGT among participants who completed most of the scheduled sessions."</P>
