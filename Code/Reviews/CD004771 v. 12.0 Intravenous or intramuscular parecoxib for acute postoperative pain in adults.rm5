<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-18 13:00:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most common route for administration of postoperative analgesia is by mouth, but some patients are unable to swallow, feel nauseated, or vomit in the immediate postoperative period, and in these patients intravenous or intramuscular administration may be preferred. This review assessed seven studies of parecoxib, an injectable COX-2 inhibitor, for acute postoperative pain relief. Single doses of 20 mg or 40 mg provided effective pain relief in 50 to 60% of treated individuals, compared with 15% treated with placebo. Duration of pain relief was longer with the higher dose (10.6 hours for 40 mg versus 6.9 hours for 20 mg), and significantly fewer individuals on the higher dose required rescue medication over 24 hours (66% versus 81%). Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and were reported by just over half of treated individuals in both parecoxib and placebo groups.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:41:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the &#8220;pain relief versus time&#8221; curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with parecoxib and placebo experiencing at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours, using validated equations. The number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95% confidence intervals (CI). The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were also collected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-16 11:32:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Seven studies (1446 participants) were included. There was no significant difference between doses, or between intravenous and intramuscular administration for 50% pain relief over 6 hours: NNTs compared with placebo were 3.1 (2.4 to 4.5), 2.4 (2.1 to 2.8), and 1.8 (1.5 to 2.3) for 10, 20, and 40 mg parecoxib respectively. Fewer participants required rescue medication over 24 hours with parecoxib than placebo: parecoxib 40 mg was significantly better than parecoxib 20 mg (NNTs to prevent use of rescue medication 7.5 (5.3 to 12.8) and 3.3 (2.6 to 4.5) respectively; P &lt; 0.0007). Median time to use of rescue medication was 3.1 hours, 6.9 hours and 10.6 hours with parecoxib 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg respectively, and 1.5 hours with placebo. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, rarely led to withdrawal, and did not differ in frequency between groups. No serious adverse events were reported with parecoxib or placebo.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:44:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>A single dose of parecoxib 20 mg or 40 mg provided effective analgesia for 50 to 60% of those treated compared to about 15% with placebo, and was well tolerated.

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:42:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:41:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage, commonly accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care.</P>
<P>This is one of a series of reviews that aim to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level.</P>
<P>Recent reviews include lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>), paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), and celecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), and the series will include updates of existing reviews like ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>) and aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Oldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldman 1999</LINK>), in addition to new reviews such as ketoprofen and dexketoprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2008</LINK>), lornoxicam (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>), diflunisal (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The number of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following 4 to 6 hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome in this setting. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over 4 to 6 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients often remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first 6 hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Clinicians prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a routine basis for a range of mild-to-moderate pain. NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed analgesic medications worldwide, and their efficacy for treating acute pain has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). They reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 2001</LINK>). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of action of this class of compounds aside from their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-dependent prostanoid formation (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Since NSAIDs do not depress respiration and do not impair gastro-intestinal motility, as do opioids (BNF 2002), they are clinically useful for treating pain after minor surgery and day surgery, and have an opiate-sparing effect after more major surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cyclooxygenase (COX) activity has been found to be associated with at least two distinct isoenzymes: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 was hypothesized to be involved in the maintenance of physiologic functions such as gastric protection and haemostasis; COX-2 was thought to be involved in pathophysiologic processes such as inflammation, pain and fever. These hypotheses led to the development of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, rofecoxib and etoricoxib. These agents have analgesic efficacy comparable with conventional NSAIDs. In addition, they have no anti-platelet activity at therapeutic doses, and therefore may be associated with reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Concerns about cardiovascular safety in long term use have led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib, and in some countries lumiracoxib.</P>
<P>The most common route for postoperative analgesia is oral, but when patients are unable to swallow, for instance perioperatively, parenteral administration (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, intrathecal) may be preferred. Some NSAIDs can be administered intramuscularly (e.g., diclofenac, ketoprofen and ketorolac) but this route can be painful in itself. Diclofenac and ketorolac can be administered intravenously, but ketorolac is contraindicated for patients receiving heparin and those who might be susceptible to bleeding from gastrointestinal ulcers or who have renal impairment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Parecoxib</HEADING>
<P>Parecoxib was the first COX-2 to be administered parenterally. It is a prodrug (the parent drug is inactive) that is rapidly hydrolysed in vivo to its active form, valdecoxib. Clinical trials have indicated that parecoxib is effective in treating postoperative pain resulting from oral surgery, orthopaedic surgery and abdominal hysterectomy pain. Other studies have demonstrated no significant effects on platelet function or upper gastrointestinal mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Graff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graff 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noveck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noveck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoltz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltz 2002</LINK>). As a result, parecoxib sodium has been approved in European countries for the treatment of postoperative pain. In the UK, for example, parecoxib 20 mg or 40 mg powder (and solvent or solution for injection) is licensed for the short-term treatment of postoperative pain.</P>
<P>In 2002 concerns were raised about the potential for serious adverse effects from parecoxib because of reactions experienced by some patients to valdecoxib, the active metabolite of parecoxib sodium. These effects included anaphylaxis, angioedema, and serious skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2002</LINK>), and led to withdrawal of valdecoxib in 2005. As a result, parecoxib is contraindicated in patients who have a history of sensitivity to sulphonamides (a type of antibiotic used to treat infections) because of the risk of severe adverse effects. A recent review of prescription event monitoring has shown that the incidence of serious skin reactions with any coxib is very low (crude rate 0.008%; <LINK REF="REF-Layton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layton 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A previously published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2003</LINK>) assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of parecoxib for treating postoperative pain from four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (620 participants) and concluded that parecoxib is an effective analgesic in the postoperative setting. Since then, new studies have been published, and it is hoped that they will provide additional data for more robust estimates of the benefits and harms of parecoxib.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants who received study medication in each treatment group. Analyses were planned for different doses. Sensitivity analyses were planned for the primary outcome to determine the effect of the pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain) and the quality score (two versus three or more). A minimum of two studies and 200 participants were required for any analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). Where only one active treatment arm in a study contributed to a particular comparison, the whole placebo group was used for analysis. When more than one active treatment arm contributed to a comparison, the placebo group was divided equally between the contributing arms for the analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: number of participants with at least 50% pain relief</HEADING>
<P>For each study, the mean TOTPAR, SPID, VAS TOTPAR or VAS SPID (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) values for active and placebo were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR were calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit/relative risk (RR), and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT).</P>
<P>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, numbers of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" were taken as those achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes:</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Use of rescue medication</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants requiring rescue medication were used to calculate RR and numbers needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) use of rescue medication for treatment and placebo groups. Median (or mean) time to use of rescue medication was used to calculate the weighted mean of the median (or mean) for the outcome. Weighting was by number of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants reporting adverse events for each treatment group were used to calculate RR and numbers needed to treat to harm (NNH) estimates for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>any adverse event;</LI>
<LI>any serious adverse event (as reported in the study);</LI>
<LI>withdrawal due to an adverse event.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy (participants using rescue medication - see above) and adverse events were noted, as were exclusions from analysis where data were presented.</P>
<P>Relative benefit or risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). NNT, NNTp and NNH with 95% CI were calculated using the pooled number of events by the method of Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). A statistically significant difference from control was assumed when the 95% CI of the relative benefit did not include the number one.</P>
<P>Homogeneity of studies was assessed visually (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abb_x00e9_-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbé 1987</LINK>). The z test (<LINK REF="REF-Tram_x00e8_r-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tramèr 1997</LINK>) was used to determine if there was a significant difference between NNTs for different doses of active treatment, or between groups in the sensitivity analyses.<B>

The relative benefit for at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours was 3.5 (2.4 to 5.2) and the NNT was 2.4 (1.9 to 3.1). Two studies with 208 participants gave parecoxib 40 mg intramuscularly (<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malan 2005</LINK>), with a RR of 4.6 (2.7 to 7.7) and an NNT of 2.0 (1.6 to 2.5).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Participants who took rescue medication were classified as withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and are reported under 'use of rescue medication' above.</P>
<P>Data on other withdrawals were generally poorly reported, probably because these were single dose studies where withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy are uncommon. Some studies reported participants who had invalid data due to inadequate baseline pain, protocol violation, or use of rescue medication within the first hour, as withdrawals or exclusions. Whether these should be included in the intention-to-treat population is arguable. Attrition due to invalid data is unlikely to affect results.</P>
<P>A total of 13 participants were reported as withdrawing due to adverse events: five after parecoxib 20 mg, four after parecoxib 40 mg and two after placebo, mostly due to headache (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2002</LINK>); one due to an unspecified adverse event after parecoxib 40 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Malan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malan 2005</LINK>); and one after parecoxib 40 mg due to anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2002</LINK>) (please see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:35:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This review included a total of 1446 participants. In total 320 participants were treated with a single dose of parecoxib 20 mg, and 278 with parecoxib 40 mg. This is around twice the number compared to a previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2003</LINK>), giving a more robust (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>), but almost identical result at these doses. In addition, the new studies provide limited amounts of data for lower doses.</P>
<P>The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours. All doses of parecoxib showed a significant difference from placebo with NNT values of 10.3 (6.0 to 37.1) for 1 mg, 7.2 (4.6 to 16.7) for 2 mg, 3.7 (2.7 to 5.6) for 5 mg, 3.1 (2.4 to 4.5) for 10 mg, 2.4 (2.1 to 2.8) for 20 mg, and 2.2 (1.9 to 2.6) for 40 mg. The numbers of participants in each treatment group for 1 mg to 10 mg were low and the CIs are wide so data from these groups should be interpreted cautiously. There was no significant difference in the relative benefit or NNT for 50% pain relief over 6 hours between 20 mg and 40 mg, although a dose response trend was observed.</P>
<P>Because the same methods of analyses have been used, it is possible to compare the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours for a single dose of parenteral parecoxib with that of a single dose of other analgesics. There are no data available for intravenous administration of other NSAIDs so comparisons with oral or intramuscular analgesics are made.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Analgesics with comparable efficacy to parecoxib (20 mg to 50 mg) include rofecoxib 50 mg (NNT 2.2 (1.9 to 2.4)) (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2005</LINK>), celecoxib 400 mg (NNT 2.5 (2.2 to 2.9) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), diclofenac 100 mg (NNT 2.3 (2.0 to 2.5)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009b</LINK>), and naproxen 500 mg (NNT 2.7 (2.3 to 3.3)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Analgesics with lower efficacy include morphine 10 mg (IM) (NNT 2.9 (2.6 to 3.6)), ketorolac 30 mg (IM) (NNT 3.4 (2.5 to 4.9)) (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>), aspirin 600/650 mg (NNT 4.4 (4.0 to 4.9) (<LINK REF="REF-Oldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldman 1999</LINK>) and paracetamol 600/650 mg (NNT 4.6 (3.9 to 5.5)) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Analgesics with superior efficacy include etoricoxib 180/240 mg (NNT 1.5 (1.3 to 1.7) and etoricoxib 120 mg (NNT 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1)) (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>A current listing of reviews of analgesics in the single dose postoperative pain model can be found at <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier</A>.</P>
<P>Significantly fewer participants required rescue medication with parecoxib than with placebo, and although no significant difference between 20 and 40 mg parecoxib was demonstrated for the primary outcome, significantly fewer participants required rescue medication with parecoxib 40 mg than with parecoxib 20 mg. Seven to eight individuals would need to be treated with parecoxib 20 mg, and three with parecoxib 40 mg to prevent one form needing rescue medication over 24 hours, who would have done so if treated with placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication varied greatly between studies, particularly for the active treatment arms, but was generally longer for parecoxib than placebo, and for parecoxib 40 mg than parecoxib 20 mg. The weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication was 1.5 hours for placebo, 3.1 hours for parecoxib 10 mg, 6.9 hours for parecoxib 20 mg and 10.6 hours for parecoxib 40 mg.</P>
<P>Longer duration of action is desirable in an analgesic, particularly in a postoperative setting where the patient may experience postoperative nausea, or be dependent on a third party to respond to a request for rescue medication, or both. Duration of pain relief and requirement of rescue medication information have only recently been recognised as important outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), and a fuller evaluation of the importance of these outcomes will depend on more data being collected from other, ongoing, systematic reviews. For the studies included in this review, differences in use of rescue medication allowed discrimination between doses that was not seen with the primary outcome.</P>
<P>Assessment of adverse events is limited in single dose studies as the size and duration of the trials permits only the simplest analysis, as has been emphasised previously (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). There were insufficient data in these studies to compare individual adverse events. There was no significant difference between parecoxib and placebo for the numbers of participants experiencing any adverse event in the hours immediately following a single dose of the study medication, with rates of around 54% in both groups. Combining results was potentially hampered by the different periods over which the data was collected. Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity, and were most likely to be related to the anaesthetic or surgical procedure (e.g. nausea, vomiting and somnolence). It is important to recognise that adverse event analysis after single dose administration will not reflect possible adverse events occurring with use of drugs for longer periods of time. In addition, the relatively small number of participants, even when all the trials were combined, is insufficient to detect rare but serious adverse events. An increase in serious adverse events (wound infection, cerebro- and cardiovascular events, and renal dysfunction) has been reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received parecoxib for three days, followed by valdecoxib for 10 to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Nussmeier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nussmeier 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ott-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ott 2003</LINK>). No such events were seen in these single dose studies.</P>
<P>Importantly, none of the studies reported any clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory findings, physical examination or vital signs in any of the patients during the study period.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis did not demonstrate any significant effect of route of administration of parecoxib on relative benefit or NNT. A significantly increased efficacy of parecoxib, using pooled doses, in dental studies compared to studies involving other postsurgical pain was demonstrated. Differences between dental and other postsurgical pain have been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>), where consistently lower placebo responses in the dental pain model do not effect the NNT as a measurement of efficacy. In all three dental studies in this analysis, the placebo response rate was very low (2% to 4%), and this result may be due to random chance in the relatively small number (151) of placebo-treated participants. The over-representation of women, particularly in the non-dental studies may have influenced the results, but this is thought to be unlikely as clinically meaningful differences between men and women in response to NSAIDs have not been demonstrated previously (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2002</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-16 12:25:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Parecoxib is an effective analgesic in postoperative pain with a low incidence of adverse events when given as a single dose. At a dose of 20 mg to 40 mg it provided effective analgesia for 50 to 60% of patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain following various types of surgery. For every two participants treated with parecoxib 20 mg or 40 mg, one would experience at least 50% pain relief who would not have done so with placebo. Associated adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-16 16:29:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Additional data is required to confirm the results of this review and provide a more robust estimate of efficacy, particularly for the lower doses. Further data for the lower doses will help determine the minimum effective dose and establish a dose response for parecoxib. In clinical practice the aim should always be to use the lowest dose possible to achieve the desired benefit with minimal risk of adverse events. More data for the intravenous and intramuscular routes will help to decide which route of administration is most effective for parecoxib in the clinical setting, while more data from different types of surgery may help determine whether there are clinically important differences between them.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none=0, mild=1, moderate=2 and severe=3, and for relief none=0, slight=1, moderate=2, good or lots=3 and complete=4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">VAS</HEADING>
<P>Visual analogue scale: For pain intensity, lines with left end labelled "no pain" and right end labelled "worst pain imaginable", and for pain relief, lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for 6 hours, they would have a 6-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID</HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS TOTPAR</B> and <B>VAS SPID</B> are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
