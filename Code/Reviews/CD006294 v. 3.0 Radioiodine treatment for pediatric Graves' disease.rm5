<P>Graves' disease is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood. Affected children and adolescents suffer from increased heart beats, warm moist skin, fatigue, weight loss, raised body temperature, eye and other problems. Application of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), surgical removal of the thyroid gland or drugs that interfere with the production of thyroid hormones (antithyroid drugs) are used to treat this disease.<BR/>Two relevant trials with 167 patients were identified. The limited data suggest that a gland specific lower dosage of radioiodine treatment is potentially effective for pediatric GD, but a significant higher incidence of hypothyroidism compared with ATD was observed. However, all of the analysed studies were of low quality. No trial evaluated mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance with treatments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and pathogenesis of pediatric Graves' disease (GD)</HEADING>
<P>Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease caused by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies, which stimulate the gland to synthesize and secrete excess amounts of thyroid hormones. GD is characterized by thyrotoxaemia, developed as a result of a complex interaction between predisposing genes and environmental triggers. Most children with thyrotoxicosis suffer from GD accounting for 10% to 15% of all childhood thyroid diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 1998</LINK>). Pediatric GD has a peak incidence at 11 to 15 years of age. The female to male preponderance is approximately 5:1. Graves' disease can be familial and associated with other autoimmune diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2005</LINK>). Most pediatric GD patients have a positive family history of some type of autoimmune thyroid disease. Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is an organ specific autoimmune process strongly linked to Graves' hyperthyroidism. GO occurs in 33% of patients with pediatric GD; its prevalence is higher in countries with a higher prevalence of smoking among teenagers (<LINK REF="REF-Krassas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krassas 2005</LINK>). GO varies in different population studies and is age-related. Pathogenesis of GO is not yet fully understood.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical manifestations</HEADING>
<P>The classic clinical manifestations of pediatric GD include nervousness, emotional lability, fatigue, weight loss, restless sleep, and rapid heart beat, all of which result in deteriorating school performance. The signs of pediatric GD include diffuse goiter, tachycardia, exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema. However, symptoms and signs of pediatric GD are typically insidious in onset and sometimes confusing, even mimicking hypothyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Nordyke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordyke 1988</LINK>).<BR/>GO has a variable clinical presentation such as eyelid retraction, proptosis, periorbital edema, chemosis, and disturbances of ocular motility. In some cases, GO may progress to visual loss as a result of exposure to keratopathy or compressive optic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2002</LINK>). Fortunately, the severity of childhood GO appears to be less than that of adulthood GO, and more likely to remit completely, presumably explained by the lower prevalence of smoking in children. Therefore, most patients do not require specific therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durairaj-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durairaj 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gruters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruters 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krassas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krassas 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was based on classic clinical manifestations, common clinical signs, elevated free thyroxine (FT4), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), suppressed plasma thyroid-stimulation hormone (TSH) concentration, and positive immunological markers. Toxic diffuse goitre was established as GD. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin measurement, if raised, will strongly support a diagnosis of GD. Nonspecific laboratory findings can occur in Graves' disease, including anaemia, granulocytosis, lymphocytosis, hypercalcaemia, transaminase elevations, and alkaline phosphatase elevations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 15:36:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Once the diagnosis of pediatric GD is established, therapy should be adopted to control hyperthyroidism to avoid untoward effects on growth and pubertal development. Three treatment modalities are available for pediatric GD: antithyroid drugs (ATD), surgery and radioiodine (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LeFranchi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeFranchi 1991</LINK>). The goal of therapy for pediatric GD is to correct the hypermetabolic state with the fewest side effects and the lowest incidence of hypothyroidism. Up to date, the optimal therapy remains controversial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Radioiodine (<SUP>131</SUP>I)</HEADING>
<P>Radioiodine is a &#946;,&#947;-emitting radionuclide with a physical half-life of 8.1 days, a principal &#947;-ray of 364 keV, and a principal &#946;-particle with a maximum energy of 0.61 Mev, an average energy of 0.192 Mev, and a range in tissue of 0.8 mm. At present, radioiodine is the most commonly used treatment for adult GD. Radioiodine was introduced for the treatment of GD more than 50 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1983</LINK>). While a number of studies have indicated a dose-response effect, no clear threshold dose has been identified. Early but not late hypothyroidism is possibly associated with radioiodine dosage. A gland-specific dosage (50 to 200 &#956;Ci or 1.85 to 7.4 MBq radioiodine per gram of thyroid tissue) based on the estimated weight of the gland and the 24-hour uptake may allow a lower dosage and result in a lower incidence of hypothyroidism but may have a higher recurrence rate (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2003</LINK>). A gland-specific dosage is mostly used in China. A higher-dose ablative therapy (13.8 to 15.6 mCi) is an effective therapy in nearly all children with Graves' disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nebesio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nebesio 2002</LINK>). Early hypothyroidism may result from this regimen and the children have to be closely monitored. Two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Allahabadia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allahabadia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gruters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruters 1999</LINK>) have shown that the eventual incidence of hypothyroidism is comparable regardless of the radioactive iodine dosage. Therefore, the responses to treatment as related to the iodine-131 dose in children are not well-defined.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antithyroid drugs (ATD)</HEADING>
<P>Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the mostly used agents available for GD. The starting dosage of methimazole is 15 to 30 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2005</LINK>). Methimazole is adjusted according to clinical status and monthly free T4 or free T3 levels, toward an eventual euthyroid (i.e. normal T3 and T4 levels) maintenance dosage of 5 to 10 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woeber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woeber 2000</LINK>). The starting dosage of PTU is 100 mg three times per day with a maintenance dosage of 100 to 200 mg daily (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2005</LINK>). In most cases, a dosage of 80 to 320 mg per day is sufficient. Beta-blockers are mostly used as treatment adjuncts to offer prompt relief of the adrenergic symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, heat intolerance, and nervousness. Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem can be used to reduce heart rate in patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Ginsberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginsberg 2003</LINK>). There is no clear evidence in favour of giving thyroid hormone supplementation following the initial treatment of GD with antithyroid medication (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effects of dose, regimen and duration of ATD therapy for Graves' disease on the recurrence of hyperthyroidism, course of ophthalmopathy and adverse effects have been widely studied. The comparison of a block-replace regimen (where a higher dose of antithyroid drug is used with a replacement dose of thyroid hormone) with a titration regimen (where the antithyroid drug dose is reduced by titrating treatment against thyroid hormone concentrations) suggested that there was no significant difference between the regimens for relapse of hyperthyroidism (relative risk (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.03) (<LINK REF="REF-Allannic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allannic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allannic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allannic 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Mayor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Mayor 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maugendre-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maugendre 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weetman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weetman 1994</LINK>). Remission rates vary with the length of treatment, but rates of 60% have been reported when therapy is continued for two years (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2003</LINK>). A longer period of methimazole treatment was needed to normalize serum thyroid hormone levels and to restore normal thyroidal triiodothyronine suppressibility in aged patients (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 1994</LINK>). A systemic review by Abraham indicated that the titration regimen appeared as effective as the block-replace regimen, and was associated with fewer adverse effects. Limited evidence suggested 12 to 18 months of antithyroid drug treatment should be used (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many pediatric endocrinologists currently recommend ATDs as a first-line treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2001</LINK>) because ATD treatment frequently results in subsequent remission (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 1998</LINK>). However, only 20% to 30% of pubertal and 15% of prepubertal individuals treated with ATD as the first-line treatment will experience long-term remission (<LINK REF="STD-Hamburger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hamburger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lazar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivkees-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivkees 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1997</LINK>). Additionally, ATD medications are associated with side effects and a high relapse rate. Serious and fatal side effects of ATDs like liver toxicity leading to organ failure have been observed in single cases (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1997</LINK>). ATD medications also need frequent monitoring of blood cells with a high risk for recurrence of GD due to poor compliance during adolescence. Long-term quality of life assessments as well as follow-up investigations after ATD treatment of pediatric GD seem to be completely lacking.</P>
<P>Relapse of GD after stopping treatment was ascertained either by hyperthyroxinaemia with re-appearance of overt or persistent (more than two months) thyrotoxic symptoms such as palpitation, excessive sweating, tremor, fatigue, weight loss, or by worsening biochemical thyrotoxicosis at two consecutive visits regardless of symptoms. When necessary, the possibility of superimposing painless thyroiditis was ruled out by pertechnetate uptake test (<LINK REF="REF-Misaki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misaki 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Thyroidectomy</HEADING>
<P>Surgery still plays an important role when patients cannot tolerate ATD therapy, when medical treatment is rejected by patients, or when surgery is deemed the fastest and safest route in managing the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Schussler_x002d_F-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schussler-F 2006</LINK>). A subtotal or total thyroidectomy remains controversial. A subtotal thyroidectomy is performed most commonly. Contrarily, given that subtotal thyroidectomy provides an unpredictable outcome and that the risk of permanent complications is not less than after total thyroidectomy, total thyroidectomy is the preferred option for the surgical management of Graves' disease (<LINK REF="REF-Barakate-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barakate 2002</LINK>). In Europe, subtotal or total thyroidectomy is the therapy of choice after recurrence during or after ATD treatment in pediatric GD (<LINK REF="REF-Cheetham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheetham 1998</LINK>). Surgery also has been suggested as the primary choice of treatment. However, thyroidectomy has the disadvantages of hospitalization, surgical complications such as nerve palsy, postoperative hypoparathyroidism and postoperative hypothyroidism. Still thyroidectomy requires careful medical preparation and experienced anaesthesiologists and surgeons to avoid operative morbidity. Postoperative recurrence of hyperthyroidism is observed in a significant number of patients (2% to 16%) (<LINK REF="REF-Witte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witte 1997</LINK>). Postoperative hypothyroidism, which occurs in up to 80% of the patients, results in the need of lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy and lifelong monitoring of thyroid function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Historically, radioiodine was associated with a considerable increase in the risk of thyroid cancer in young children exposed to external radiation. Radioiodine has traditionally been used if major side effects were experienced or if hyperthyroidism did not remit after several years of ATD treatment. There is now a tendency to advocate radioiodine as a choice of treatment also for children (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklyn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklyn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leu 2003</LINK>). Radioiodine has been increasingly used in some Canadian centers as a first-line therapy for adolescents and for patients who have trouble adhering to the medication schedule (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK>). In a recent review on the experience in 587 American children aged between one and 18 years, no serious complications have been observed during a follow-up period of up to 23 years (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>). Therefore, radioiodine is considered as a safe and effective therapy for pediatric GD.</P>
<P>Side effects of radioiodine include vomiting and radiation-induced thyroiditis as well as the development of thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>). In the pooled analysis of seven studies, the risk of developing thyroid carcinoma after irradiation below the age of five years is twofold higher than in children treated with irradiation between five and nine years of age, and fivefold higher than in children treated between 10 and 14 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ron-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ron 1995</LINK>). However, no increase in the overall cancer mortality after 131-I therapy compared with standard US mortality rates was observed over a mean follow-up period of 21 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ron-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ron 1998</LINK>). In general, no significant increased risk of thyroid malignancy has been reported so far after radioiodine treatment for approximately 1000 children with Graves' disease (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freitas-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freitas 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamburger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hamburger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayek-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayek 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kogut-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kogut 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safa-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safa 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Starr-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starr 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 1998</LINK>). The duration of follow-up in these studies ranged from less than five years to 15 years, with only some children followed up for more than 20 years. Studies of the offspring born to patients who received radioiodine for childhood GD revealed a 3% incidence of congenital anomalies, similar to the general population. Furthermore, there are no reports of an increase in miscarriage rates or fetal losses because of genetic abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Holm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holm 1991</LINK>). Permanent hypothyroidism occurred in 60% to 70% of the patients, leading to the same long-term problems after subtotal or total thyroidectomy. The appearance or worsening of ophthalmopathy following radioiodine remains controversial. There is very limited experience with radioiodine treatment in very young children (<LINK REF="REF-Gruters-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruters 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>In summary, strategies for pediatric GD vary from country to country. In Europe, ATD remains the initial treatment of choice in almost all the medical centers, with surgery being used mainly to deal with antithyroid failures, while radioiodine is preferred by only a small percentage of physicians for this group of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Perrild-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrild 1994</LINK>). On the other hand, radioiodine therapy for pediatric GD has strong advocates in the USA, who emphasize the safety, simplicity and economic advantages of radioiodine ablation therapy, which should be considered more commonly in children (<LINK REF="REF-Halnan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halnan 1985</LINK>). Recently, also in the UK and the Netherlands radioiodine treatment has been recommended as a primary choice or second-line therapy for pediatric GD (<LINK REF="REF-Franklyn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklyn 1992</LINK>). There are currently no systematic reviews on studies of radioiodine treatment for pediatric GD.</P>

<P>Adequacy of the allocation concealment process<BR/>A - adequate measures to conceal allocations such as central randomization, serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, or another description that contains convincing elements of concealment.<BR/>B - unclearly-concealed trials in which the author do not report an allocation concealment approach at all.<BR/>C - inadequately-concealed allocation that reports an approach that does not fall into one of the categories in (A).<BR/>D - does not conceal allocation.</P>
<P>Potential for selection bias after allocation<BR/>A - trials where an intention-to-treat analysis is possible and few losses to follow up are noted.<BR/>B - trials which report exclusions, but exclusions were less than 10%.<BR/>C - no reporting on exclusions or exclusions of at least 10%, or wide differences in exclusions between groups.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies will be broadly subdivided into the following three categories:<BR/>A - all quality criteria met (adequate): low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met (unclear): moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met (inadequate or not used): high risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Altogether 167 children and adolescents with Graves' disease (GD) participated in the trials. All the patients were recruited in China with ages ranging from 2 to 18 years. Participants who were initially treated with radioiodine, antithyroid drugs (ATD) or thyroidectomy were included and analysed in two trials. The diagnostic criteria of the trials were mostly based on clinical symptoms, physical signs and laboratory tests (mainly thyroid gland function tests). Every trial enrolled patients with hyperthyroid GD. No definition of exclusion criteria was described in the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>). One trial described disease duration (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>). The disease duration of hyperthyroidism was 9 ± 6 months versus 8 ± 6 months in patients treated with radioactive iodine versus ATD. The disease duration was not mentioned in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>). The number of participants was 80 individuals in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>) and 87 individuals in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>).

<P>The included CCTs used the following treatments (evaluation of radioiodine treatment versus ATD):<BR/>All participants received one dose of radioactive iodine. The doses of radioactive iodine were calculated according to the thyroid size, the highest uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid and clinical factors. A dose of 1.85 to 3.70 MBq per gram of thyroid tissue, with an overall dose 74 to 296 MBq (2 to 8 mCi) was administered to patients in one trial(<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>); 2.6 to 4.4 MBq per gram of thyroid tissue, with an overall dose 74 to 222 MBq (2 to 6 mCi) were given in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>). The duration of titration regimen of ATD with a dose from 50 to 300 mg (propylthiouracil, PTU), 5 mg to 30 mg (methimazole, MMI) per day was more than 1.5 years in the two trials.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 16:58:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The current available studies of radioiodine treatment for pediatric Graves' disease lack sufficient power to provide reliable evidence of the effects of treatment, due to poor methodological quality and other deficiencies of included studies. The limited evidence from this review suggests that radioiodine treatment shows benefits in achieving cure rates compared with ATD for pediatric GD, but with a significant higher incidence of hypothyroidism.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the following limitations of the included studies are highlighted:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>There was heterogeneity between the trials: The heterogeneity may have resulted from the low quality of trials and selection bias. The treatment arms in the two studies were established by convenience which may lead to selection bias.</LI>
<LI>Outcome assessment could have been blinded but the trials did not use this blinding method. This could have resulted in exaggerated or minimized effects of the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Only two trials in Chinese people of low quality with 167 participants were included. The quantity of evidence is limited. Furthermore, we can not rule out publication bias, though we searched the literature extensively.</LI>
<LI>Information on baseline characteristics was insufficient: The similarity of baseline per group regarding disease duration and thyroid function was not mentioned in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>). Socioeconomic and smoking status was not stated in any of the included trials. No exclusion criteria were reported in the two included studies.</LI>
<LI>There was limited information about adverse effects, especially on the course of Graves' ophthalmopathy, health-related quality of life, and economic outcomes. Drug-specific adverse reactions such as leukopenia, hepatitis, or vasculitis were not reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Calculation of sample size was not reported in any trial.</LI>
<LI>The dose of radioactive iodine led to different therapeutic effects. The use of adapted dose or fixed dose models were potential sources of heterogeneity. A gland-specific dosage was used in the included trials. However, the overall doses of radioactive iodine were similar in the two trials.</LI>
<LI>The use of antithyroid drugs may have effects on radioiodine treatment. A systematic review reported that antithyroid drugs potentially increase rates of failure and reduce rates of hypothyroidism if they are given in the week before or after radioiodine treatment, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Walter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 2007</LINK>). The use of antithyroid drugs was not mentioned in the included trials.</LI>
<LI>The different criteria for relapse of hyperthyroidism after medications could be the cause for heterogeneity. In this review, relapse was defined as the recurrence of hyperthyroidism after achieving euthyroidism and hypothyroidism treated by any medication. The definitions of relapse were not clearly described in the two studies, which led to different therapeutic effects. Relapse was defined as the reappearance of hyperthyroidism after remaining euthyroid for at least two years treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>). The appearance of hyperthyroidism after remaining euthyroid with radioactive iodine or ATD was considered as relapse of hyperthyroidism in another included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2006</LINK>). Therefore, the relapse rates of radioiodine are difficult to compare between these studies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Finally, another question remains unsolved and important for future studies. The goal of therapy for pediatric Graves' disease is to correct the hypermetabolic state with the fewest possible side effects and the lowest incidence of hypothyroidism. However, hypothyroidism is a possible common result of radioactive iodine for pediatric GD. Is hypothyroidism our goal or a side effect of radioiodine treatment? Should therefore cure rates of radioiodine treatment for pediatric Graves' disease include both euthyroid and hypothyroid children and adolescents?</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-07 16:46:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>There is no significant evidence from well-designed trials for or against radioiodine treatment compared with antithyroid drugs (ATD) or thyroidectomy. However, our findings suggest that a gland-specific low dosage radioiodine treatment shows benefits in achieving cure rates for pediatric Graves' disease, but with a significant higher incidence of hypothyroidism compared with ATD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High-quality randomised controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate radioiodine treatment for pediatric Graves' disease. The effectiveness of radioiodine treatment should be evaluated and compared in the long-term (five years, 10 years and more) focusing on relapse rates after treatment. Authors should always report the size of the thyroid. Outcome measures should include cognition, behavior, global function, hospitalization, morbidity, growth, health and social care costs, quality of life, and mortality. Adverse events should be systematically assessed by standardized monitoring and an effective self-report system and attention should be paid to the long-term adverse effects of radioiodine treatment in large populations.</P>
