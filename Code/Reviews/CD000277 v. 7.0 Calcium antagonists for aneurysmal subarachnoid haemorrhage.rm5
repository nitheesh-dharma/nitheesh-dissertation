<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Calcium antagonists for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a bleed in the so-called subarachnoid space, which is the very small space between the brain and the skull, and which contains blood vessels that supply the brain. The cause of the bleeding usually is a rupture of a bulge in one of these vessels. This bulging or blister on a vessel is called an aneurysm. A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a relatively uncommon type of stroke; it accounts for about one in 20 (5%) of all strokes. Subarachnoid haemorrhage often occurs at a relatively young age: half the patients are younger than 55 years old. The outcome of patients after subarachnoid haemorrhage is generally poor: half the patients die within one month after the haemorrhage, and of those who survive the initial month, half remain dependent on someone else for help with activities of daily living (e.g. walking, dressing, bathing). One of the causes of poor outcome is a complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage called secondary ischaemia (ischaemia means lack of blood). This complication occurs four to 10 days (hence secondary) after the haemorrhage. The cause is not exactly known, but one of the factors involved is narrowing of blood vessels in the brain. Calcium antagonists are a type of drug that block calcium channels in cells and are often used for the treatment of high blood pressure. They have also been shown to counteract the narrowing of blood vessels after subarachnoid haemorrhage and to protect the brain against periods of ischaemia. This review of 16 trials, involving 3361 patients, has found that the outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms of survival and being independent in activities of daily living, is improved by treatment with calcium channel blockers (antagonists). If the largest trial is excluded from the analysis, the results are no longer statistically significant, and therefore the evidence is not beyond all doubt. However, given the high likelihood of benefits and the modest risks associated with this treatment, the review authors conclude that calcium antagonists, in the form of oral nimodipine 60 mg every four hours, are useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Magnesium is another calcium antagonist with promising results, but larger trials with this drug are needed before we can be certain about a beneficial effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Secondary ischaemia is a frequent cause of poor outcome in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Its pathogenesis has been incompletely elucidated, but vasospasm probably is a contributing factor. Experimental studies have suggested that calcium antagonists can prevent or reverse vasospasm and have neuroprotective properties. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether calcium antagonists improve outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2006). We handsearched two Russian journals (1990 to 2003), and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies in 1995 and 1996.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing calcium antagonists with control, or a second calcium antagonist (magnesium sulphate) versus control in addition to another calcium antagonist (nimodipine) in both the intervention and control groups.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Trialists were contacted to obtain missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixteen trials, involving 3361 patients, were included in the review; three of the studies were of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine. Overall, calcium antagonists reduced the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk (RR) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92); the corresponding number of patients needed to treat was 19 (95% CI 1 to 51). For oral nimodipine alone the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of nimodipine the results were not statistically significant. Calcium antagonists reduced the occurrence of secondary ischaemia and showed a favourable trend for case fatality. For magnesium in addition to standard treatment with nimodipine, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00) for a poor outcome and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.96) for clinical signs of secondary ischaemia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 13:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a subset of stroke and has an incidence of nine per 100,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-de-Rooij-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Rooij 2006</LINK>). Half the patients are younger than 55 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-ACROSS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACROSS 2000</LINK>), and around 70% of patients die or remain dependent on help for activities of daily life as a result of the haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Hop-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hop 1997</LINK>). Patients who survive the initial hours after the haemorrhage are at risk of deterioration from rebleeding, secondary ischaemia, hydrocephalus and medical complications. </P>
<P>Secondary ischaemia occurs in one third of all patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brilstra-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brilstra 2000</LINK>) and results in a poor outcome in half of the patients with this complication (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2000</LINK>). Secondary ischaemia develops most frequently between four to 10 days after the haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Brilstra-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brilstra 2000</LINK>). Its pathogenesis has been incompletely elucidated, but is often attributed to narrowing of intracranial arteries. This so-called vasospasm may result from an increase of calcium in the vascular smooth-muscle cell (<LINK REF="REF-Ljunggren-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljunggren 1984</LINK>). </P>
<P>Calcium antagonists reduce the influx of calcium into the cell through blocking calcium channels. Thus, a rationale for the use of calcium antagonists for prevention of secondary ischaemia was based on the notion that these drugs can counteract the influx of calcium into the vascular smooth-muscle cell, thereby decreasing the rate of vasospasm. After their introduction into clinical practice it was discovered that calcium antagonists also have neuroprotective properties. Another important effect of calcium antagonists is the induction of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Gaab-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaab 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCalden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCalden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tettenborn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tettenborn 1990</LINK>), which may counteract the potential benefits. </P>
<P>Magnesium sulphate acts as a non-competitive antagonist of voltage-dependent calcium channels, as a NMDA-receptor antagonist, and has neuroprotective and vasodilatory properties (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bergh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bergh 2004</LINK>). It has been shown to reduce cerebral vasospasm and infarct volume after experimental SAH (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bergh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bergh 2002</LINK>). Also, hypomagnesaemia occurs in more than 50% of patients with SAH and is related to the occurrence of secondary ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bergh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bergh 2003</LINK>). These observations have led to the hypothesis that magnesium sulphate can decrease the occurrence of secondary ischaemia in patients with aneurysmal SAH.</P>
<P>Several trials with nimodipine and other calcium antagonists have been performed in patients with SAH. In recent years magnesium sulphate has been added to the list of calcium antagonists that have been tested. The aim of this review is to assess the available evidence on calcium antagonists, including magnesium sulphate, in patients with aneurysmal SAH. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine:<BR/>(1) whether calcium antagonists improve outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH;<BR/>(2) whether calcium antagonists reduce the rate of secondary ischaemia;<BR/>(3) the effects of calcium antagonists on rebleeding after aneurysmal SAH;<BR/>(4) the efficacy of each calcium antagonist separately on outcome, occurrence of secondary ischaemia and occurrence of rebleeding;<BR/>(5) the effect of various regimens of nimodipine administration on secondary ischaemia and outcome after aneurysmal SAH;<BR/>(6) whether magnesium-sulphate, in addition to nimodipine, improves outcome, reduces the rate of secondary ischaemia and affects the rate of rebleeding after aneurysmal SAH.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-23 13:09:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We sought to identify all unconfounded randomised trials comparing any calcium antagonist with control in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Trials where intervention and control groups received a calcium antagonist (nimodipine) and patients were randomised to receive either a second calcium antagonist (magnesium sulphate) or placebo were also included. We excluded uncontrolled studies, as well as quasi-randomised controlled trials where allocation to treatment or control group was not concealed (e.g. allocation by alternation, open random number list, date of birth, day of the week, or hospital number), since foreknowledge of treatment allocation might lead to biased treatment allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients of any age and either gender with SAH documented by either computerised tomography (CT) scan or cerebrospinal fluid examination were included in the analysis. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm should be proven, preferably by angiography, or at least be highly likely, judged by the pattern of haemorrhage on the CT scan. The patients could be in any clinical condition before the start of study treatment.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment with any calcium antagonist, including magnesium sulphate, versus control, or with a second calcium antagonist (magnesium sulphate) versus control in addition to a calcium antagonist (nimodipine) in both groups, starting within 10 days of SAH onset. Trials in which treatment was started only after the onset of symptoms from secondary ischaemia were not included.</P>

<P>For previous versions of this review, we handsearched two Russian neurological and neurosurgical journals (<I>Zhurnal Nevropatologii i Psikhiatrii Imeni SS Korsakova</I> and <I>Terapevticheskii arkhiv</I>) from 1990 to 2003. In 1995 and 1996, we also contacted 18 pharmaceutical companies asking them to provide any other relevant randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and trial quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted details of randomisation methods, blinding of treatments and outcome assessments. We aimed to extract from each trial the outcome assessments at the end of follow up for all patients who were originally allocated to each treatment group to perform an intention-to-treat analysis. On the basis of the extracted data the review authors decided whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, and whether treatment groups were comparable with regard to major prognostic risk factors for outcome, the number of patients who were excluded or lost to follow up, definition of outcome events, and entry and exclusion criteria. In addition, we recorded study drug dose, route and timing of the drug administration, type and timing of aneurysm treatment, duration of follow up, number of deaths, severe disability, CT-documented infarction, episodes of rebleeding, whether angiography was performed before randomisation, and adverse effects of study drugs. Functional outcome was dichotomised into poor outcome (death or dependency for daily activities) and good outcome (independent for daily activities) based on the information of the individual trials. For the trials of magnesium sulphate we recorded whether study medication was given in addition to another calcium antagonist (nimodipine) or not. If patients were excluded or lost to follow up after randomisation (trials with so-called explanatory analysis) or if any of the above data were not available from the publications, we sought further information by contacting the trialists to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the data about patients who were excluded or lost to follow up remained unavailable, a decision whether to include this particular trial in the review was made by all review authors. Quality of allocation concealment was rated as follows: A - adequate, double-blinded treatment concealment; B - unknown whether treatment concealment was adequate, C - single-blinded or no blinding of treatment concealment for outcome assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We based the primary analyses on the intention-to-treat results (if available) of the individual trials, for 'poor outcome' (death or dependence on help for activities of daily life), and for case fatality. We calculated an estimate of the treatment effect across trials (relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI)) using standard methods. We also calculated absolute risk reductions and numbers needed to treat. To quantify inconsistency across trials, we used the I-squared statistic, which describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity. A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>If primary analyses suggested a beneficial effect, secondary analyses were performed according to the worst-case-scenario method. A worst-case-scenario analysis assumes that those patients who had been excluded or lost to follow up in the treatment group have the worst possible outcome while those patients who had been excluded or lost to follow up in the control group have the best possible outcome. If the effects of primary and secondary meta-analyses were of the same direction and magnitude, we could make a definitive conclusion regarding the treatment effectiveness, otherwise no definitive conclusion was made. Worst-case-scenario analysis was also performed if efficacy was found for the prevention of clinical events, but not for para-clinical outcome measurements, such as cerebral infarction documented by CT scan, since para-clinical outcomes are usually assessed in patients with a clinical deterioration only.</P>
<P>After previous versions of this review were published, new trials of magnesium sulphate have been performed. Since nimodipine is now the standard treatment in many countries, trials have been performed with magnesium sulphate in addition to a standard regimen with another calcium antagonist (nimodipine). Therefore, studies that assessed magnesium sulphate in the absence of another calcium antagonist (nimodipine) were included in the main analysis; studies that assessed magnesium sulphate in the presence of another calcium antagonist (nimodipine) were analysed separately.</P>
<P>Additional pre-specified analyses were based on:<BR/>(1) the methodological quality of the trials (exclusion of trials in which blinding for treatment allocation or outcome assessment was not performed or reported);<BR/>(2) the time between SAH and randomisation (exclusion of trials enrolling patients after four days);<BR/>(3) the time of the outcome assessment;<BR/>(4) separate assessment of the efficacy of each agent and route of administration;<BR/>(5) exclusion of the largest trial.</P>
<P>To test for a difference between subgroups, the Deeks method was used (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>

The trials were performed between 1983 and 2006. Sixteen of these 27 trials were included in the review, including three trials of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine (<LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>). Details of these trials are given in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. The other 11 trials were excluded for the following reasons: two trials of nimodipine were excluded because nimodipine was started only after the development of secondary ischemia (<LINK REF="STD-Jan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jan 1988</LINK>, 188 patients) or after vasospasm (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>, 84 patients); four trials totalling 561 patients were excluded because allocation to the treatment and control groups was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Islekel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Islekel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maldonado-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Maldonado 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1995</LINK>) or the allocation to the treatment or control groups was not concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Prevedello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Prevedello 2006</LINK>); another trial of magnesium sulphate was excluded because it was not a randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cadoux_x002d_Hudson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cadoux-Hudson 1999</LINK>); one trial of 30 patients was excluded because outcome was given only for those patients with secondary ischaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Cabral-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cabral 1991</LINK>); and another study with 32 patients was excluded because there were no data on any of the outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Xie-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 1994</LINK>). Two trials of magnesium in addition to nimodipine, both aiming to include several hundreds of patients, are presently ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-IMASH" TYPE="STUDY">IMASH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MASH_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">MASH-II</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Size of the trials and treatment modes</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis included 16 studies with a total of 3361 patients (1665 in the treatment group and 1696 in the control group). In three trials, with 383 patients, magnesium sulphate versus placebo was studied in addition to nimodipine. The number of patients per trial ranged from 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>) to 906 (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>). The mean ages of the patients ranged from 44 to 56 years. In 13 trials, the study treatment was started within four days after onset of SAH; in three trials it was started within 10 days after onset of SAH (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>). In these three trials, drug therapy was started in 69% to 86% patients within three days after the most recent SAH.</P>
<P>Nimodipine was given orally every four hours in a total daily dose of 360 mg in five trials (593 treatment group patients including 246 patients who received oral medication after seven to 10 days of continuous intravenous infusion) (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>), in a total daily dose of 540 mg in one trial (91 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>), and in a total daily dose of 2.1 mg/kg in another trial (58 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>). In one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>), 13 patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of nimodipine in a dose of 2 mg/hour. One study first administered nimodipine five to eight drops per minute of 10 mg per 50 ml solution for eight to 10 hours daily intravenously for 15 days, followed by 90 mg orally for another 15 days (exact dosage in mg unknown) (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). In two trials where nimodipine was given orally or through a continuous intravenous infusion (95 patients), this drug was also administered intraoperatively into the basal cisterns near the exposed arterial segments (<LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>). Duration of the nimodipine treatment was 21 days in all trials but two. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>), the treatment duration was at least nine days whereas the overall treatment period was not specified, in another trial the treatment period was 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). There were two trials of nicardipine treatment after aneurysmal SAH; one trial with oral nicardipine three doses of 60 mg per day for 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>) and one with intravenous nicardipine 0.15 mg/kg/hr for 14 days after the SAH (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>). Another trial studied AT877 given in three doses of 30 mg intravenously per day for 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>). One study assessed magnesium sulphate versus control in the absence of another calcium antagonist as standard treatment; in this study magnesium was given intravenously, 25 mg in 500 cc of 5% glucose, 20 to 40 drops per minute, one to two times a day for two to three weeks (exact dosage in mg unknown) (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all three trials where patients were randomised to receive either magnesium sulphate or placebo in addition to standard nimodipine treatment, magnesium sulphate was administered intravenously (<LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>). One trial used a bolus infusion of 6 g followed by continuous infusion at 2 g/hour for 10 days and dosage adjustments were made to maintain magnesium levels between 4 and 5.5 mg/dl (between 1.7 and 2.3 mmol/L). Patients in the placebo group received routine infusions of magnesium sulphate if serum magnesium was less than 2 mg/dl (0.8 mmol/L) (<LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>). A second trial used magnesium sulphate 64 mmol/day continuously for 14 days after occlusion of the aneurysm or for 18 days after the SAH (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>); a third trial used a bolus injection of 20 mmol followed by 80 mmol magnesium sulphate per day continuously for 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aneurysm treatment</HEADING>
<P>In 11 of the 13 trials of calcium antagonists versus placebo, the aneurysm was treated by surgical clipping; in six trials, the aneurysm was clipped in all patients, in the other five trials 30% to 60% of patients had their aneurysm clipped. Two studies did not mention the method of aneurysm treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). In the three trials of magnesium sulphate versus placebo in addition to nimodipine, aneurysms were treated with surgical clipping (52% to 66% of all patients) as well as endovascular coiling (24% to 28% of all patients) (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>). In none of these three trials were results given separately according to the way the aneurysm was occluded.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>In 2741 (82%) of the patients, aneurysms were confirmed by angiography or autopsy. In three trials angiography was not mandatory before randomisation; in one of these two trials an aneurysm was demonstrated by angiography or autopsy in 77% of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>), in the other trial in 66% of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>). One trial included patients with an aneurysmal pattern on CT scan, and in the absence of an aneurysmal pattern on CT an aneurysm had to be confirmed by angiography (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>); another trial included patients with a SAH on CT scan, without further specification (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>). Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>) enrolled only patients in good or fairly good clinical condition on admission (Hunt and Hess grades I to III).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures and follow-up duration</HEADING>
<P>In 10 trials poor outcome (death or dependence) was assessed at one to six months. Two trials measured functional outcome as early as after three weeks when most patients with aneurysmal SAH are still hospitalised and complications may still supervene (<LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>). One trial report did not specify case fatality separately from poor outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>). Duration of follow up was 21 days in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>); duration of hospital stay in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>), one month in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>); two months in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>); three months in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>), three to six months (mean duration 114 days) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>); six months in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>), and at six months and also at one to three years in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on secondary ischaemia (ischaemic neurological deficit by clinical criteria or CT-scan-documented cerebral infarction) were available for all 16 trials included in the analysis. Rebleeding during the follow-up period was reported in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Method of randomisation and data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Six trials used envelopes (sealed, opaque, and sequentially numbered) as the method of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2006</LINK>). In five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Messeter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Messeter 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Bergh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Bergh 2005</LINK>), numbered or coded containers administered sequentially to the enrolled participants were used to randomise patients to either the treatment or control group. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>), patients were randomised by means of separate randomisation lists (type unspecified) for each centre, balanced in blocks of four. In four trials the exact method of randomisation was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome assessment and comparability of the treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>A double-blind placebo-controlled design was used in 12 of the 16 trials. In one trial outcome assessment was unblinded (<LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>), and for another it remained unknown whether the outcome assessment was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>). Two studies did not use a placebo and did not mention whether outcome assessment was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). Data on outcome were incomplete in seven of the 16 included studies, mostly because patients with a different diagnosis or other protocol violations had been excluded from the analysis after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veyna-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Veyna 2002</LINK>). The number of patients without data on follow up totalled 47 for the treatment group (5.7% of all patients in the treatment group of the seven trials with incomplete follow up, and 2.8% for all 16 trials); this number was 38 for the control group (4.5% of the control patients in the seven trials with incomplete follow up, and 2.2% for all 16 trials). Treatment and control groups were well balanced for major prognostic factors in 14 of the trials; two trials did not give information on baseline characteristics other than age and gender (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nine trials adequately reported functional outcome within six months after the SAH, totalling 2589 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neil_x002d_Dwyer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Neil-Dwyer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shibuya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibuya 1992</LINK>) (Comparison 01.01). The relative risk (RR) for poor outcome (death or dependency) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92). The absolute risk reduction was 5.3%; the corresponding number of patients needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent a single poor outcome event was 19 (95% CI 1 to 51).</P>
<P>In a sensitivity analysis for trials of good methodological quality, we excluded four of the seven trials: one in which the method of blinding treatment allocation was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>), and three in which it was uncertain whether assessment of outcome was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petruk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Petruk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>). The estimated effect without these trials was essentially unchanged (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90). The RR was just no longer statistically significant in the worst case scenario (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03) or when the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>) was excluded from the analysis (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03).</P>
<P>When two trials that reported on outcome as early as 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Ferro-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ferro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philippon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Philippon 1986</LINK>) were excluded, the RR remained essentially the same (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.93).</P>
<P>Also a subgroup analysis of patients admitted within four days of SAH, with the exclusion of three trials in which patients were randomised until seven days after the SAH (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1991</LINK>), did not appreciably change the result (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.80). Analysis for poor outcome according to type of calcium antagonist and route of administration showed that the results are statistically significant only for oral administration of nimodipine (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.81). For the trials that administered nimodipine first intravenously and then orally, no statistically significant effect was found (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.28). For the other calcium antagonists, the results were inconclusive: in the AT877 trial the relative risk for poor outcome was 0.84 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.23); for the trial of intravenous nicardipine 0.97 (95% CI: 0.78 to 1.20); and for one very small trial of oral nicardipine 1.31 (95% CI 0.58 to 2.95) (Comparison 01.01).</P>
<P>Comparison 01.02 shows poor outcome according to the timing of outcome assessment. There were no statistical differences between the subgroups of different calcium antagonists (P = 0.43) or between the subgroups according to timing of outcome assessment (P = 1.0) as determined by the Deeks method (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of prophylactic calcium antagonists on clinical outcome and secondary ischaemia</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Calcium antagonists versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Our aggregation of all calcium antagonist trials suggests a reduction of poor outcome (defined as death or dependency in activities of daily life) after SAH, though the reduction of case fatality alone is not statistically significant. In addition, calcium antagonists reduce the frequency of secondary ischaemia; this is probably the most likely intermediate factor through which calcium antagonists exert their beneficial effect on outcome. The data also indicate that oral nimodipine improves the overall outcome, in agreement with the conclusions of previous overviews (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mascio-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mascio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tettenborn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tettenborn 1990</LINK>). There is no evidence that nimodipine or other calcium antagonists improve outcome when given intravenously. In the worst-case-scenario analysis and after exclusion of the largest trial with oral nimodipine, the benefit in terms of reduction in 'poor outcome' is no longer statistically significant, which implies that the benefits of nimodipine are not beyond all reasonable doubt. Also, there was statistical heterogeneity between the studies for oral nimodipine and the beneficial effect on poor outcome for oral nimodipine was mainly based on one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 1989</LINK>). Another issue that must be addressed is that in none of these studies were aneurysms treated by endovascular coiling, so strictly there is no information on calcium antagonist therapy in patients treated with this technique. Nevertheless, since the point estimates remain essentially the same in the sensitivity analyses, our data strongly suggest that oral nimodipine (60 mg every four hours) is efficacious as initial treatment in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists, which is more expensive and has a substantial risk of induced hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-Haley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haley 1993</LINK>), cannot be recommended on the basis of the present evidence. However, the lack of statistical significance of intravenous calcium antagonists could be part due to the small number of patients studied with this strategy. For magnesium in addition to nimodipine, the results of this meta-analysis are very promising. The relative risk for both poor outcome and the occurrence of clinical secondary ischemia were statistically significant, and the relative risk for case fatality showed a favourable trend. However, the number of included patients is small and these results need to be confirmed by larger trials, of which two are currently being conducted (<LINK REF="STD-IMASH" TYPE="STUDY">IMASH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MASH_x002d_II" TYPE="STUDY">MASH-II</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of calcium antagonists on rebleeding</HEADING>
<P>Our data suggest that the use of calcium antagonists in patients with SAH is not associated with an increased frequency of rebleeding; in contrast, we found a statistically significant reduction in the rate of rebleeding. This reduction is independent from the clinical condition on admission of patients and from the type of calcium antagonists used, but it may well be a confounding effect through the protection against ischaemia, which allows earlier operation. Only one magnesium study reported on rebleeding and the result is inconclusive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In the current review, dose-related effects of calcium antagonist drugs other than nimodipine could not be addressed because of the lack of sufficient data. In a randomised double-blind dose-comparing study of nicardipine (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1994</LINK>), the beneficial clinical effects of high-dose (0.15 mg/kg/hr) and low-dose (0.075 mg/kg/hr) intravenous nicardipine treatment were virtually equivalent, but administration of low-dose nicardipine was attended by fewer serious side effects. Similar results have been obtained in another dose-ranging study (<LINK REF="REF-Massiou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massiou 1992</LINK>) where the tolerability of four doses of intravenous nicardipine (0.03, 0.08, 0.11, and 0.15 mg/kg/hr) was assessed. A dose escalating open clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Shibuya-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibuya 1990</LINK>) comparing various doses of AT877 has indicated that AT877 has its most favourable effects at a dosage of 90 mg per day. Two of the magnesium studies reported adverse effects; there were no serious adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological issues of the present overview</HEADING>
<P>We have examined all randomised controlled trials in which any type of calcium antagonist was compared with control in patients with SAH. The trials were comparable with respect to study design and selection of patients, and most had a well-balanced distribution of prognostic factors for poor outcome between treatment and control groups, which adds to the validity of the results. Sensitivity analyses showed that the beneficial results in terms of risk reduction for poor outcome were robust in that the results did not appreciably change after exclusion of trials with questionable blinding or trials with randomisation of patients more than four days after SAH, or after inclusion of trials with very late enrolment or very early assessment. The benefits were no longer statistically significant when a worst-case-scenario analysis was applied to patients who had been randomised but not accounted for in the published reports, because of erroneous diagnosis or protocol violations.</P>
<P>Since the mechanisms of action differ for the calcium antagonists included in the review, we separately assessed the efficacy of each drug. The reason for including AT877 in the overview on calcium antagonists was that, apart from protein kinase inhibiting properties (<LINK REF="REF-Seto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seto 1995</LINK>), this drug has also an intracellular calcium antagonist action (<LINK REF="REF-Satoh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satoh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takizawa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takizawa 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on our conclusions, we recommend oral nimodipine (60 mg every four hours, to be continued for three weeks) as standard treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Although the evidence about the beneficial effect of nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, and is mainly based on one large study where aneurysms were treated with surgical clipping, we recommend oral nimodipine given the potential benefits and modest risks associated with it. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists is more expensive and potentially hazardous in view of hypotensive effects, and is therefore not recommended. There is no evidence that nicardipine or AT877 has a significant effect on functional outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given that the evidence for the protective effect of calcium antagonists against secondary ischaemia and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is no longer statistically significant after exclusion of a single large trial with oral nimodipine, and that most studies have been performed in the era before coiling was available, further placebo-controlled trials of oral nimodipine could provide a more definitive conclusion. In practice, the support for a confirmatory study is bound to be modest. Even on the assumption that the benefits of oral nimodipine after SAH are beyond any doubt and are also valid in patients with aneurysm occlusion by means of coiling, there are other unresolved issues: the advantages and disadvantages in patients in poor clinical condition on admission or in patients with established cerebral ischaemia, the optimal dose, the optimal time window, and the question whether other types of calcium antagonists offer better protection. Magnesium sulphate is a potent calcium antagonist and a promising agent in patients with SAH; further trials are needed and under way.</P>

<TITLE>Results for nimodipine separately</TITLE>

</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>This review pools data from trials of nimodipine, nicardipine and AT877 <BR/>in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Since nimodipine alone is <BR/>widely used in SAH, the results for its effects need to be reported <BR/>separately for all outcomes, not for just some as in the review now.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>In the update of November 2001, also for secondary ischaemia, the results of nimodipine are reported separately. Therefore, the updated version provides results for nimodipine separately for all outcomes (for poor outcome and rebleeding in the analyses figures, for the other outcomes in the text). All data are provided in such a way that consumers can make additional calculations if they want to.</P>
