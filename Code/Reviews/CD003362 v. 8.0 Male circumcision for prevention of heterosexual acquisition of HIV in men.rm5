<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:30:03 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Male circumcision is defined as the surgical removal of all or part of the foreskin of the penis and may be practiced as part of a religious ritual, as a medical procedure, or as part of a traditional ritual performed as an initiation into manhood. Since the 1980s, over 30 observational studies have suggested a protective effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. In 2002, three randomised controlled trials to assess the efficacy of male circumcision for preventing HIV acquisition in men commenced in Africa. This review evaluates the results of these trials, which analysed the effectiveness and safety of male circumcision for preventing acquisition of HIV in heterosexual men.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:01:21 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We formulated a comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy in an attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). In June 2007 we searched the following electronic journal and trial databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. We also searched the electronic conference databases NLM Gateway and AIDSearch and the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and Current Controlled Trials. We contacted researchers and relevant organizations and checked reference lists of all included studies.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:30:47 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and graded methodological quality. Data extraction and methodological quality were checked by a third author who resolved differences when these arose.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:34:51 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three large RCTs of men from the general population were conducted in South Africa (N = 3 274), Uganda (N = 4 996) and Kenya (N = 2 784) between 2002 and 2006. All three trials were stopped early due to significant findings at interim analyses. We combined the survival estimates for all three trials at 12 months and also at 21 or 24 months in a meta-analysis using available case analyses using the random effects model. The resultant incidence risk ratio (IRR) was 0.50 at 12 months with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34 to 0.72; and 0.46 at 21 or 24 months (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.62). These IRRs can be interpreted as a relative risk reduction of acquiring HIV of 50% at 12 months and 54% at 21 or 24 months following circumcision. There was little statistical heterogeneity between the trial results (&#967;² = 0.60; df = 2; p = 0.74 and &#967;² = 0.31; df = 2; p = 0.86) with the degree of heterogeneity quantified by the I² at 0% in both analyses. We investigated the sensitivity of the calculated IRRs and conducted meta-analyses of the reported IRRs, the reported per protocol IRRs, and reported full intention-to-treat analysis. The results obtained did not differ markedly from the available case meta-analysis, with circumcision displaying significant protective effects across all analyses.</P>
<P>We conducted a meta-analysis of the secondary outcomes measuring sexual behaviour for the Kenyan and Ugandan trials and found no significant differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men. For the South African trial the mean number of sexual contacts at the 12-month visit was 5.9 in the circumcision group versus 5 in the control group, which was a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant at the 21-month visit (7.5 versus 6.4; p = 0.0015). No other significant differences were observed.</P>
<P>Incidence of adverse events following the surgical circumcision procedure was low in all three trials.</P>
<P>Reporting of methodological quality was variable across the three trials, but overall, the potential for significant biases affecting the trial results was judged to be low to moderate given the large sample sizes of the trials, the balance of possible confounding variables across randomised groups at baseline in all three trials, and the employment of acceptable statistical early stopping rules.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:36:24 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is strong evidence that medical male circumcision reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months. Incidence of adverse events is very low, indicating that male circumcision, when conducted under these conditions, is a safe procedure. Inclusion of male circumcision into current HIV prevention measures guidelines is warranted, with further research required to assess the feasibility, desirability, and cost-effectiveness of implementing the procedure within local contexts.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:43:43 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Male circumcision is defined as the surgical removal of all or part of the prepuce (foreskin) of the penis and may be practiced as part of a religious ritual usually conducted shortly after birth or in childhood; as a medical procedure to treat or prevent infections, injury, or anomalies of the foreskin; or as part of a traditional ritual performed as an initiation into manhood (<LINK REF="REF-Horizons-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horizons 2000</LINK>). Since the 1980s, observational studies have suggested an association between male circumcision and HIV infection in males. Most of these studies suggested a protective effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in men.</P>
<P>Theories to support the biological basis for a protective effect of circumcision on HIV exist. Researchers have noted that the inner aspect of the foreskin is well supplied with Langerhans cells (<LINK REF="REF-Szabo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szabo 2000</LINK>) and that in vitro, HIV-1 demonstrates a specific tropism (attraction) for these cells (<LINK REF="REF-Soto_x002d_Ramirez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soto-Ramirez 1996</LINK>), in particular the CD4 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Hussain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussain 1995</LINK>) on them. CD4 and other HIV co-receptors have been shown to facilitate HIV entry into host cells. According to this theory, circumcision would remove the potential entry site for HIV; however, not all Langerhans cells are removed during circumcision, as after the procedure there may be residual penile mucosa of the glans; and also there are Langerhans cells in the penile shaft (<LINK REF="REF-Cold-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cold 1999</LINK>). In direct contradiction to the above theory, the inner prepuce contains apocrine glans which secrete lysozyme (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1998</LINK>). Lysozyme reportedly kills HIV-1 in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Huang 1999</LINK>), suggesting a protective effect of the foreskin. In a 2002 study that used immunofluorescence and image analysis to quantify cells expressing HIV-1 co-receptors, adult foreskin mucosa had greater susceptibility to infection than cervical mucosa or the external surface of the foreskin tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2002</LINK>). More recently, in 2006, an immunohistochemical analysis of foreskin tissue from 49 Kenyan men confirmed that the inner mucosal surface of the human foreskin contains 2% of Langerhans cells and macrophages, making it highly susceptible to HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Donoval-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donoval 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to 2003, six reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Moses-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Vincenzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vincenzi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moses-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Howe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Howe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2001</LINK>) and one meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2000</LINK>) had been published which reached different conclusions on the association between male circumcision and HIV infection. In 2003 we published a Cochrane review of 35 observational studies and concluded that insufficient evidence existed to support an interventional effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men (<LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 2003</LINK>). The review supported previous review findings that the results from existing observational studies showed a strong epidemiological association between male circumcision and prevention of HIV, especially among high-risk groups. Unlike a previous review by <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2000</LINK>, however, no meta-analysis was performed due to the high degree of statistical, clinical, and methodological heterogeneity between the included studies. In particular, we noted study quality to be highly variable, with no studies including the same set of potential confounding variables in their adjusted analyses. We identified three ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) during the conduct of the review, and for this reason, we recommended that the results of these three trials be awaited before circumcision be implemented as a public health intervention for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV. The Cochrane review was updated in 2005 with two additional observational studies, but the inclusion of these studies did not alter the review conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2005 the results of a South African RCT of male circumcision for preventing HIV acquisition in heterosexual men was published (<LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>), followed in early 2007 by the publication of Kenyan (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK>) and Ugandan (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK>) RCT findings. In the light of these RCT results, we now are able to assess the efficacy and safety of male circumcision as an intervention to reduce heterosexual acquisition of HIV infection by men in the update of our Cochrane review.</P>

<B>4. Data analysis</B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome, HIV incidence, was expressed using survival estimates which incorporate the time until men were diagnosed with HIV infection, or the time free from infection, or the time until they were lost to follow-up, either because they did not return for testing or because the trial was stopped early. The effect measure of choice for these time-to-event data was the incidence risk ratio (hazard ratio) calculated from data extracted from the trial report (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We used an intention-to-treat analysis (as defined by receipt of intervention according to randomised group). For the secondary outcomes (i.e., sexual behaviour outcomes) we calculated the relative risk as the effect measure for dichotomous data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed homogeneity in the study results using the Chi-square test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of significance as the cut-off. The impact of statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis was conducted because the identified studies were sufficiently homogenous. We combined incidence risk ratios (hazard ratios) using the generic inverse variance function available in RevMan (Version 5.0). Relative risks were combined using a random effects inverse variance method.</P>
<P>In the event of significant clinical heterogeneity, we had planned to explore possible causes by looking at the characteristics of the various studies critically. Possible sources of heterogeneity in this review may have included HIV1 versus HIV2, age at circumcision, religion, socio-economic status, marital status, sexual behaviour, sexually transmitted diseases, and condom use.</P>
<P>We used sensitivity analysis to explore the difference in meta-analysis results when using:</P>

<P>See Characteristics of Included Studies for complete details.</P>
<P>Three large RCTs have been conducted in Orange Farm, South Africa (N = 3 274), Rakai, Uganda (N = 4 996), and Kisumu, Kenya (N = 2 784). All were conducted on men from the general population. In the South African and Kenyan trials, participants were 18 to 24 years old and in the Ugandan trial, men were 15 and 49 years old. At the commencement of the Kenyan and Ugandan trials, men who were HIV-infected were excluded from participating, but in the South African trial, men who were HIV-positive at trial enrolment were retained in the trial but excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>Circumcision was performed using commonly used surgical techniques under local anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK> used the forceps-guided technique and <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK> used the sleeve procedure). Those randomised to the control arm were offered circumcision at the end of each trial. Total follow-up was planned for 21 months in the South African trial and for 24 months in the Kenyan and Ugandan trials. All three trials commenced in 2002. The South African trial was stopped early in April 2005 by the Institutional Monitoring and Safety Board after interim results exceeded the limits of the early stopping rule. The Kenyan trial and the Ugandan trial were also stopped early in December 2006 for the same reason.</P>

<I>Random generation</I>
</P>
<P>None of the trials clearly described the method used for generating the random sequence. <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> described preparing sets of 10 envelopes, and both <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK> report using "blocking," so it is likely that the sequence was generated by a computer for all three trials. For this reason we assumed the risk of bias for this domain to be low in all three trials.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation requires that the next assignment not be known until the next patient has been recruited. For envelope-based methods it requires the envelopes being opaque, sealed, serially numbered on the outside, and used in the order which the numbers indicate. Although all three trials reported sequential envelopes, participants in <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK> were asked to select one envelope from a box of <I>x</I> (where <I>x</I> is the block size in the trial) after which the envelope was replaced by the next envelope from the next batch. This resulted in imbalances between study groups, thereby reducing the blocking effect. As the process allowed participants to pick envelopes, it would not ensure that the envelopes were opened one at a time and used in order. Therefore, the procedure must be graded as inadequate. As <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK> did not explicitly report using sealed envelopes, although the process was otherwise adequately reported, we have marked allocation concealment as unclear. There may be a moderate to high risk of bias introduced into the trials due to the methods of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<I>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors</I>
</P>
<P>Participants and study personnel could not be blinded to the allocated interventions (circumcision or not). It is unclear whether this lack of blinding could influence the outcome (HIV status) via, for example, sexual risk behaviour or differentiated treatment by study personnel. The primary outcome was HIV incidence based on laboratory results. In <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>, the specimens were clearly reported as being identified only by a participant number, and so masking was adequate for assessors and the risk of bias was low. In the other two trials, blinding of outcome assessors was poorly described and was graded as unclear. The risk of bias is likely to be low, however.</P>
<P>
<I>Incomplete outcome data</I>
</P>
<P>Attrition was high in all three trials. We rated the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome reporting as moderate in all three trials, as acceptable statistical survival analysis techniques were used to estimate HIV event distribution over time by accumulating for staggered enrolment and incomplete discrete follow-up.</P>
<P>
<I>Selective outcome reporting</I>
</P>
<P>All three trials clearly stated in their protocols that the primary outcome was HIV incidence. The risk of bias due to incomplete outcome reporting is therefore low in all three trials.</P>
<P>
<I>Other potential threats to validity</I>
</P>
<P>All three trials were stopped early due to data-dependent processes (formal-stopping rules), and this may have introduced a risk of bias to the studies.</P>

<B>Primary outcome</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>HIV incidence at 12 months and at 21 or 24 months </I>
</P>
<P>We combined the survival estimates for all three trials at 12 months and also at 21 or 24 months in a meta-analysis using available case analyses using the random effects model (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The resultant incidence risk ratio (IRR) was 0.50 at 12 months with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34 to 0.72, and 0.46 at 21 or 24 months (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.62). These IRRs can be interpreted as a relative risk reduction of acquiring HIV of respectively 50% (at 12 months) and 54% (at 21 or 24 months) following circumcision. There was little statistical heterogeneity between the trial results (&#967;² = 0.60; df = 2; p = 0.74 and &#967;² = 0.31; df = 2; p = 0.86) with the degree of heterogeneity quantified by the I² as 0% in both analyses. Thus the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) is not important.</P>
<P>The background risk of HIV infection in the population should be considered in the decision to circumcise men, selecting the populations who stand to benefit most for this intervention. To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) from the above figures (at 21 or 24 months), it is valuable to consider first the populations with a low assumed control risk (ACR) of HIV infection of 1% (10 per 1000) over two years. For this ACR, the NNT is 186 (95% CI 152 to 264); this would prevent 5 (95% CI: 3 to 6) HIV infections over two years per 1000 men. For a higher ACR of HIV infection of 3% (30 per 1000) over two years, the NNT is 62 (95%CI: 51;88); this would prevent 16 (95%CI: 11;19) HIV infections over two years per 1000 men. For an even higher ACR of 5% (50 per 1000) over two years, the NNT is 38 (95% CI: 31 to 53); this would prevent 26 (95% CI: 18 to 32) HIV infections over two years per 1000 men.</P>
<P>
<I>Sensitivity analysis</I>
</P>
<P>In order to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated IRRs, we conducted meta-analyses of the reported IRRs, the reported per protocol IRRs, and a reported full ITT analysis.</P>
<P>We combined the reported results for all three trials at 21 to 24 months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This resulted in a slightly stronger effect than the calculated IRRs (IRR = 0.41 with 95% CI from 0.30 to 0.56). This can be interpreted as a relative reduction in risk of acquiring HIV of 59% following circumcision. There is, again, little statistical heterogeneity present (&#967;² = 2.09, df = 2; p = 0.35; I² = 5%). Thus the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) is very small and not important. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>) presented reported results from an analysis at 12 months (IRR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.12). This effect is somewhat weaker and is not significant compared to the significant effect from the calculated IRR for this specific study (see <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> at 12 months in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also combined the reported per protocol results for all three trials at 21 to 24 months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). This resulted in a stronger effect of IRR = 0.34 with 95% CI from 0.24 to 0.47. This result can be interpreted as a relative reduction in risk of acquiring HIV of 66% following circumcision. There is, again, little statistical heterogeneity present (&#967;² = 2.09, df = 2; p = 0.35; I² = 5%). Thus the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) is very small and not important.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>) reported results from a full ITT analysis (IRR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.66) and an adjusted analysis (IRR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.66), both at 21 months. In each case, the effect of circumcision was protective and significant and in the same range as the calculated estimate (see <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and reported estimate (see <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) for this study.</P>
<P>At 12 months the combined risk difference in HIV infection was -0.83% with 95% CI from -1.25% to -0.41% between circumcised and uncircumcised men with minimal statistical heterogeneity (&#967;² = 1.62, df = 2; p = 0.44; I² = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). At the end of the studies (21 or 24 months), the risk difference dropped further to -1.80% with 95% CI from -2.48% to -1.12% with minimal statistical heterogeneity (&#967;² = 1.00, df = 2; p = 0.61; I² = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). This can be interpreted as a significant absolute risk reduction of 0.83% at 12 months and of 1.80% at 21 or 24 months, following circumcision. The NNT calculated from the above figures (at 21 or 24 months) is 56 (95% CI: 41 to 90). Circumcision would prevent 17 HIV infections (95% CI: 11 to 24) over two years per 1000 men (for the combined observed control risk of the populations in the three trials).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>We combined sexual behaviour results at 12 months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and at 21 or 24 months (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). from the <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK> trials, where available. The <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> trial reported only IRRs from adjusted analysis.</P>
<P>At 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) as well as 24 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), we obtained combined risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals for behavioural outcomes. At both time points the effects for two or more partners, non-marital partner, casual last contact, inconsistent or no condom use, alcohol with sex ,and transactional sex were not significant. At 12 months, the combined RRs for sexually active (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK>) and any unprotected sex (only <LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK>) were not significant at, respectively, 1.02 (95%CI: 1.00 to 1.04) and 1.08 (95%CI: 1.00 to 1.17), but the direction of the effect indicates a relative increase in risky behaviour of 2% and 8%, respectively, and possible disinhibition among circumcised men. These two estimates remained exactly the same at 24 months. Only for two or more partners (at 12 as well as 24 months) was there statistical heterogeneity between the trial results (&#967;² = 2.20, df = 1; p = 0.14 in both analyses) with the degree of heterogeneity quantified by the I² at 55% in both analyses. Thus the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) is moderate.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK> trial, number of sexual contacts greater than five was recorded in the three months preceeding the first three-month visit and in the nine months preceeding the 12- and 21-month visits. In an adjusted model, the IRR for men who were circumcised versus men in the control arm was 1.61 with 95% CI: 0.90 to 2.88 and was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). In the same model, the IRR for at least one sexual contact not protected by condom was not significant at 1.02 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.83; p = 0.95). The mean number of sexual contacts at the 12-month visit was 5.9 in the circumcision group versus 5 in the control group, which was a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant at the 21-month visit (7.5 versus 6.4; p = 0.0015).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
</P>
<P>Each trial recorded adverse events including events considered related and not related to circumcision. In <A HREF="file:///c:/documents%20and%20settings/nsiegfri.mrcad/my%20documents/revman/anrs%201265">ANRS 1265</A>, however, only adverse events for the circumcised group were reported.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>, 60 (3.8%) adverse events were recorded during the first month post surgery for the 1 568 participants who were circumcised; this included the 73 HIV-positive men who also were circumcised and not included in the final analysis. Adverse events were categorised according to event and not severity. No deaths were recorded and the most common adverse events were pain (31.7%), excessive bleeding (15%), swelling or haematoma (16.7%), and problems with appearance (15%). Other events recorded were infection (5%), damage to the penis (6.7%), insufficient skin removed (6.7%), delayed wound healing (3.3%), and other cause not defined (8.3%). At 21 months post-circumcision, 11 adverse events were noted in the 1 131 men returning for their 21-month visit. These included problems with urinating (3/1131), problems with appearance (4/1131), and mild or moderate erectile dysfunction (4/1131).</P>
<P>In <A HREF="file:///c:/documents%20and%20settings/nsiegfri.mrcad/my%20documents/revman/bailey%202007">Bailey 2007</A>, 24 adverse events were recorded as possibly, probably, or definitely related to circumcision in 23 (1.7%; 95%CI: 1.2 to 2.6) of 1334 participants. None of these events were classified as serious and included post-operative bleeding (5), infections (5), wound disruptions (4), delayed healing (3), swelling at the incision site (2), convulsion following anaesthetic (1), wound at base of penis (1), pubic abscess (1), folliculitis (1), and erectile dysfunction (1). All events resolved within hours or days except for the erectile dysfunction&#8212;the investigators note that erectile dysfunction post-randomisation occurred with an incidence of 1.5% in the circumcised group and at 1.0% in the control group. This was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). A total of 10 154 unrelated adverse events were recorded among 71% of participants. Of those events classified as serious, 17 occurred in 16 men in the intervention group and 15 in 14 men in the control group. Marginally statistically significant differences in abdominal or gastrointestinal conditions were noted in the control group (p = 0.047), and the incidence of balanitis, phimosis, and paraphimosis was statistically significantly higher in the control group (p &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>In <A HREF="file:///c:/documents%20and%20settings/nsiegfri.mrcad/my%20documents/revman/gray%202007">Gray 2007</A> there were 178 adverse events in the 2 328 circumcisions that were carried out, with five events classified as severe, including wound infection (1), haematoma requiring re-exploration and ligation of active bleeding vessels (2), wound disruption (1), and post-operative herpetic ulceration not involving the surgical wound (1). An additional 79 moderate events and 94 mild events related to surgery were recorded. All severe and moderate events were managed and resolved. Overall, the number of all adverse events reported was 1 391 in the intervention group and 1 320 in the control group (56% versus 52%; p = 0.083). Of the events in the control group, none were considered to be related to the trial; 87% of events in the circumcision group were considered to be related to the trial.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 13:19:08 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three large African RCTs assessing the effectiveness of male circumcision in preventing HIV acquisition in sexually active men in the general population were conducted between 2002 and 2006. The results indicate compelling evidence that male circumcision, when conducted using a medical procedure, reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months. Incidence of adverse events is very low, indicating that male circumcision, when conducted under these conditions, is a safe procedure. In the light of the results from all three trials, UNAIDS and the WHO released a press release in March 2007 advocating the inclusion of male circumcision into current HIV prevention measures guidelines in countries with low circumcision rates and generalized epidemics.</P>
<P>
<B>Strengths and limitations of our review</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted comprehensive searches of both journal and conference databases to ensure that all relevant published and unpublished trials were identified. We did not limit the searches to a specific language. Our ongoing interaction with the investigators of all three trials from before the trials commenced until trial completion, and our regular communication with global policymakers at UNAIDS and the WHO, ensured that we were aware of all trial activity in this field. Furthermore, given the high-profile nature of the intervention and the complexity of conducting circumcision trials, it is unlikely that our search strategy failed to detect existing current trial evidence. Potential bias in the conduct of our review also was minimised by having two independent researchers extracting data and assessing the methodological quality of each study. This detailed process allows for a thorough assessment of trial conduct and an exploration of the possible biases that may be present in each trial.</P>
<P>Each trial employed early stopping rules considered acceptable statistical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1987</LINK>). Stopping each of the three trials early, however, resulted in high attrition within each trial, ranging from 30% to 46%. Use of survival analysis, which incorporates the results from all of those who completed the trial and who are censored due to loss to follow-up or early stopping of the trial, will have reduced the potential attrition bias in each trial. This was done in each trial. It is important to note, however, that in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2005</LINK>) of RCTs stopped early for benefit, such RCTs were found to overestimate treatment effects. When trials with events fewer than the median number (n=66) were compared with those with event numbers above the median, the odds ratio for a magnitude of effect greater than the median was 28 (95% CI 11 to 73) (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mills-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCartney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCartney 2008</LINK>). Each of the trials included in our review yielded fewer than 66 events and may thus overestimate the treatment effect; however, the magnitude of effect was consistent across all three trials, which strengthens the evidence in favour of male circumcision.</P>
<P>The review is of aggregate trial data. Published aggregate data from trials can be variable in the completeness of outcome reporting and in definitions of both the intervention and outcomes used between trials. This is particularly relevant where survival analysis has been used for outcome reporting and individuals have been censored at different end points during a trial, as occurred in all three included trials. Ideally we would have conducted a meta-analysis of the individual participant data (IPD) from each trial. Obtaining IPD allows the outcome and time period for each participant to contribute to an overall analysis, ensuring that valuable information from each participant is incorporated into the analysis. In addition, use of only the aggregate data meant that we were not able to explore subgroup analysis for different risk factors of participants (e.g., marital status, number of sexual partners, age at time of randomisation). During the review process, we contacted each of the principal investigators of the three trials to ascertain their willingness to share their data. A proposal to conduct the IPD under the auspices of The Cochrane Collaboration but with full involvement and authorship of each principal investigator was submitted to UNAIDS. To date, two of the three investigators have agreed to share their data.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects and behavioural disinhibition</B>
</P>
<P>All three trials assessed adverse effects of the circumcision procedure and found these to be consistently low. It is important to recognise that the circumcision was conducted as a medical procedure and within the trial environment. Policy-makers wishing to implement circumcision as a preventive measure against acquisition of HIV will need to consider that in many countries, male circumcision is practiced as part of the rites of initiation into manhood, with the circumcision procedure conducted by traditional healers who are not trained in the aseptic surgical technique (<LINK REF="REF-Horizons-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horizons 2000</LINK>). Adverse effects following traditional circumcisions can be high (<LINK REF="REF-Peltzer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltzer 2008</LINK>). In a 2004 study of both traditional and medical circumcisions performed in Kenya, rates of adverse events following traditional circumcisions was 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2008</LINK>). Notably the rate for medical circumcisions was also high at 18%. The investigators speculate that the high rate following medical circumcision is due to a lack of knowledge about wound care and identification of complications in this setting. Promotion of male circumcision thus must be explicit that the procedure be conducted by an appropriate and skilled practitioner in a sterile clinic environment and must include education about post-operative care. Inclusion of medical procedures into traditional customs is a potential solution, but further exploration of this topic is beyond the scope of this review.</P>
<P>In the South African trial (<LINK REF="STD-ANRS-1265" TYPE="STUDY">ANRS 1265</LINK>), men in the circumcised group practised more risky sexual behaviours following the procedure than did those in the control group. Circumcised men in the Kenyan (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK>) and Ugandan (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK>) trials were consistently more sexually active than uncircumcised men, and Kenyan circumcised men (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK>) consistently engaged in more unprotected sex. These more risky behaviours could indicate possible disinhibition among circumcised men. Despite this increase in risky behaviour, however, circumcision remained protective for men within the 24-month trial period, but we do not know whether this protective effect persists in the long term. In a partner trial to <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2007</LINK>, 1 015 HIV-infected men were randomised to immediate or delayed male circumcision for two years, and their partners were invited to participate in the study (<LINK REF="REF-Wawer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wawer 2008</LINK>). Of 165 (1.5% of the initial 1 015 HIV-infected men) married couples who were followed for two years, 13.8 percent of the women partners of men who were circumcised became infected with HIV compared with 9.6 percent of the women partners of men who were not circumcised. This trend toward higher infection rates among the male-circumcised couples was too small to be considered statistically significant, but the investigators warn that male circumcision has no direct HIV benefits to women, and potentially, an increased risk of transmission with early resumption of sex. As recommended by UNAIDS and the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-and-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS and WHO 2007</LINK>), promotion of male circumcision at a country level must clearly present circumcision as partly protective for the male partner and continue to advocate other preventive measures, including being faithful and using condoms consistently. Counselling during and after the procedure should be clear and consistent in this regard.</P>

<P>Male circumcision can be considered as an effective measure to partly prevent HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Current evidence is lacking for whether it also confers protection for women. Policy-makers can consider implementation of male circumcision as part of prevention measures if considered feasible and socially and culturally acceptable for local conditions. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-30 12:08:59 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research on the effectiveness of male circumcision for preventing HIV acquisition in heterosexual men is complete. Future research must focus on the effects of male circumcision on the women partners of HIV-infected circumcised men and whether it is protective, neutral, or harmful for women partners. This could be achieved in a cohort study. Other studies should focus on the feasibility of implementing the procedure into different contexts, the social and cultural issues regarding implementation, and the cost-effectiveness of such implementation. The effects of male circumcision on HIV transmission during anal intercourse, both in men who have sex with men and between men and women, remains unclear and should also be a focus of future research. Inclusion of male circumcision into current HIV prevention measures guidelines is warranted, with further research required to assess the feasibility, desirability, and cost-effectiveness of implementing the procedure within local contexts.</P>

The final numbers between the two groups differ by 34, suggesting that imbalances occurred with this method of randomisation and allocation.

<P>Comment: The conclusions; "There is strong evidence that medical male circumcision reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men";  "research on the effectiveness of male circumcision for preventing HIV acquisition in heterosexual men is complete. No further trials are required to establish this fact" seem too strong given the trial evidence.</P>
<P>The review authors noted a number of potential sources of bias, which probably don't matter much.  But they also noted that two of the three trials had a high risk of inadequate allocation concealment and the third unclear allocation concealment.  This matters because there is empirical evidence that inadequate allocation concealment is the most important source of bias in randomised trials (Schulz et al 1995).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Handbook states:</P>
<P>"An early example [.] (Schulz 1995) demonstrated that trials in which randomization was inadequately concealed or inadequately reported yielded exaggerated estimates of intervention effect compared with trials reporting adequate concealment [.]."</P>
<P>"one of the most important potential biases in randomized trials, namely allocation concealment".</P>
<P>"A pooled analysis of seven methodological studies found that effect estimates from trials with inadequate concealment of allocation or unclear reporting of the technique used for concealment of allocation were on average 18% more 'beneficial' than effect estimates from trials with adequate concealment of allocation (95% confidence interval 5 to 29%) (Pildal 2007)."</P>
<P>The effect size seen in the present review is the best estimate at present, and it is reasonable that policy makers act on it until further data become available.  But it is surely not justified to state that the evidence is "strong", or that "research is complete and no further trials are required", when the only trials available were all at high or unclear risk of the empirically most important source of bias. </P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-04-30 12:12:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Thank you for your comment. We appreciate that you have read our review so carefully.</P>
<P>As you identify, allocation concealment is an important measure of methodological quality.</P>
<P>Recent empirical work has been published on the effects of allocation concealment on effect estimates [Savovic J <I>et al</I>. Influence of Reported Study Design Characteristics on Intervention Effect Estimates From Randomized, Controlled Trials. <I>Ann Intern Med</I>. 18 September 2012;157(6):429-438]. Results from 1292 trials from 146 informative meta-analyses, found that intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by on average 7% in trials with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment (ROR 0.93, 95% Credible Interval 0.87 to 0.99).</P>
<P>In our review it is likely that the magnitude of any bias caused by the limitation of inadequate allocation concealment is much smaller than the observed intervention effect seen in the three trials (Incidence risk ratio = 0.46 at 21 or 24 months [95% CI: 0.34 to 0.62]).</P>
<P>When making our interpretation of the results from the three trials in this review we took into consideration the totality of the evidence rather than only focusing on one dimension. These factors are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Strength and direction of the overall effect estimate</LI>
<LI>The consistency of results across all three trials</LI>
<LI>The large sample size</LI>
<LI>The use of suitable early stopping rules and suitable survival analysis</LI>
<LI>Methodological quality of the trials including blinding, sequence generation and allocation concealment, and attrition</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although allocation concealment was inadequate in two trials, the third trial in which this was rated as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2007</LINK>), used opaque envelopes with age stratum, envelope number and randomisation identity number printed on outside of envelope. The next envelope was used based on the next envelope number for the participant&#8217;s age stratum. The authors failed to report that the envelopes were sealed and so we rated this as unclear according to the Cochrane Handbook; however it is important to note it is rated as &#8216;unclear&#8217; and not &#8216;inadequate&#8217; and it is equally possible that allocation was adequately concealed. This trial also shows results consistent with the two other trials, supporting our decision to rate the evidence as &#8216;strong&#8217;.</P>
<P>We have amended the statement &#8216;no further trials are required&#8217; and under Implications for Research, we now state: 'Inclusion of male circumcision into current HIV prevention measures guidelines is warranted, with further research required to assess the feasibility, desirability, and cost-effectiveness of implementing the procedure within local contexts.'</P>
