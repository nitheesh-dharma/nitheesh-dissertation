<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with umbilical vein catheters. Sick newborn babies occasionally require the insertion of an umbilical vein catheter (a special tube) that goes into the vein in the umbilicus (belly button). This allows fluid and medicines to be given. Some people believe that antibiotics should be given to all babies with umbilical vein catheters in order to reduce the chance of infection occurring. However, antibiotics can have unwanted effects. The reviewers found insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of antibiotics for all babies with umbilical vein catheters.</P>

<P>Umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) are often used in ill neonates. Infection related to the use of these catheters may cause significant morbidity and mortality. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has been advocated for newborns with umbilical venous catheters in order to reduce the risk of colonisation and acquired infection. Prophylactic antibiotics may be effective in preventing catheter-related blood stream infection, but may have the undesirable effect of promoting the emergence of resistant strains of micro-organisms.<BR/>

<P>The primary objective was to assess whether prophylactic antibiotics in neonates with UVCs reduce mortality and morbidity. In separate comparisons, we planned to review two different policies regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics in neonates with umbilical venous catheters: 1) Among neonates with UVCs, a policy of prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of catheterization (or other fixed duration of antibiotic treatment) versus placebo or no treatment; 2) Among neonates with UVCs who had been started on antibiotics at the time of catheterization, but whose initial cultures to rule out sepsis are negative, a policy of continuing versus discontinuing prophylactic antibiotics.</P>

<P>One poor quality study met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Twenty-nine term infants, who had UVCs inserted specifically for transfusion procedures for hyperbilirubinaemia or polycythaemia, allocated non-randomly (alternate allocation) to treatment (n = 15) or control (n = 14) groups. Those in the treatment group received penicillin and gentamicin for three days. 5/15 infants given antibiotics and 5/14 control infants having positive blood cultures three days after catheter insertion. All positive blood cultures were considered contaminated, due to lack of corroborating clinical and haematological evidence of infection. Therefore, no infants were identified with evidence of septicaemia.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:12:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Umbilical venous catheters are commonly used in the management of newborn infants who are preterm or have other potentially life-threatening illness. The use of central venous catheters is recognised as a risk factor for nosocomial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nagata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagata 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). It is unclear whether umbilical venous catheters are an independent risk factor for late-onset sepsis. Stoll (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>) analysed numerous factors in a multivariate model and did not find umbilical venous catheters to be an independent significant risk. However, Chien (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2002</LINK>), on behalf of the Canadian Neonatal Network, concluded that umbilical venous catheters are a significant risk factor. Hyperalimentation with parenteral nutrition is an indication for the use of umbilical venous catheters, and is also a risk factor for nosocomial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2002</LINK>). Nosocomial infection may cause significant morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). Morbidity may include increased duration of respiratory illness, including chronic lung disease, and need for respiratory support (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 1999</LINK>); increased length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 2003</LINK>); and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>). The extent of the problem of infection related to umbilical venous catheters is largely unknown due to the widespread use of antibiotics in the population of infants who have umbilical venous catheters.</P>
<P>Patients requiring umbilical venous catheters may, by virtue of their underlying illness, have impaired defence mechanisms - both local and systemic. Prematurity is recognised as a risk factor for late onset sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Dear-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dear 1999</LINK>). Preterm neonates are at high risk of infection because of impaired immunity and umbilical venous catheters may further increase this risk because they are foreign bodies.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:14:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is common practice in neonatal units to start antibiotics in infants with respiratory distress and suspected infection, or in those delivered following preterm labour. Many of these infants will have an umbilical venous catheter inserted. It is not clear whether antibiotics should be discontinued if no infection is proven. It has been common practice in some neonatal units that if the infant has an umbilical venous catheter then antibiotics be continued in order to reduce the rate of colonisation of the umbilicus and likewise reduce the risk of acquired infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:14:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic antibiotics may be effective in preventing catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), but may have the undesirable effect of promoting the emergence of resistant strains of micro-organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Freij-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freij 1999</LINK>). A policy of prophylactic antibiotic use should take into account this possibility, and has been used as a basis for arguing against its implementation (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 2003</LINK>). Promotion of the emergence of resistant strains of organisms may vary between different antibiotics.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:13:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent Cochrane systematic review on the use of prophylactic antibiotics for neonates with umbilical artery catheters showed that there is no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics when using umbilical artery catheters in newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Inglis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inglis 2004</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:18:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to assess whether prophylactic antibiotics, in neonates with umbilical venous catheters, reduce mortality and morbidity. Morbidity included proven septicaemia, clinical septicaemia, and suspected septicaemia. Septicaemia was as defined in individual studies.</P>
<P>In separate comparisons, we planned to review two different policies regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics in neonates with umbilical venous catheters:</P>
<P>1) Among neonates with umbilical venous catheters, a policy of prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of catheterization (or other fixed duration of antibiotic treatment) versus placebo or no treatment. This addresses the question of whether or not neonates with umbilical venous catheters, who do not have clinical or laboratory evidence of infection at that time, should be routinely started on antibiotics at the time of catheterization.</P>
<P>2) Among neonates with umbilical venous catheters who had been started on antibiotics at the time of catheterization, but whose initial cultures to rule out sepsis are negative, a policy of continuing versus discontinuing prophylactic antibiotics. This addresses the question of whether or not antibiotics should routinely be stopped at the time rule out sepsis cultures are reported as negative.</P>
<P>Data permitting, subgroup analyses were planned to determine whether results differ by:<BR/>gestational age (e.g. preterm versus term, &lt; 28 weeks gestational age (GA) or not);<BR/>type of antibiotic (e.g. penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, or combinations).</P>

<P>See: Cochrane Neonatal Review Group search strategy</P>
<P>The standard search strategy for the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to April 2005, CINAHL from 1982 to April 2005, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005) using the following strategy:</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-07 13:05:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed &#8220;partial&#8221; was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>The search strategy identified four potentially eligible reports. Two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bard-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Bard 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cowett-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Cowett 1977</LINK>) were excluded because they were studies of infants with umbilical artery catheters. Another (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatt-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatt 1970</LINK>) was excluded because, as far as we could ascertain, it was a study of arterial catheters. This study was published only in Abstract form and involved 192 infants randomly assigned to treatment (i.e. prophylactic antibiotics) and control groups. The published abstract contained little methodological or outcome data. We contacted one of the authors (JEH) and were advised that no further data was available. The author advised also that, to her knowledge, the study only involved infants with arterial catheters.</P>
<P>The study by Pulido et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pulido-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pulido 1985</LINK>) was included. The study attempted to address the question of whether term infants with umbilical venous catheters had lower rates of infection when given antibiotic prophylaxis, compared with untreated controls. The study was non-randomised (quasi-randomised, using alternate group allocation), was small, of short duration, and involved infants with very specific indications for umbilical venous catheter insertion: i.e. catheters were inserted for transfusion procedures in infants with hyperbilirubinaemia or polycythaemia. There was a wide range of age at enrolment (1 - 10 days). Twenty-nine term infants with umbilical venous catheters were allocated non-randomly (quasi-randomised - alternate allocation) to treatment (n = 15) or control (n = 14) groups. Those in the treatment group received penicillin and gentamicin for three days, but no mention is made of duration of catheterization. It is possible that duration of treatment exceeded duration of catheterization or vice versa. Two peripheral blood cultures were drawn from all study infants three days after catheter insertion. Results were presented as number of positive blood cultures and number of true-positive blood cultures.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has attempted to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics are warranted in either of two circumstances:<BR/>1. Should infants with umbilical venous catheters be commenced on routine prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter insertion?<BR/>2. Should infants with umbilical venous catheters, who are commenced on antibiotics pending investigation results, be continued on antibiotics once initial infection is ruled out?</P>
<P>A major limiting factor in trying to determine the place of prophylactic antibiotics in infants with umbilical venous catheters is that catheter placement is quite often undertaken, for ease of fluid and drug administration, in the context of clinical circumstances (e.g. respiratory distress, preterm delivery) which may reflect infection. Newborn infants in such circumstances are usually commenced on antibiotics because their clinical circumstances may indicate infection at the same time that they may lead to the decision to insert an umbilical venous catheter. Because the majority of newborns in whom umbilical venous catheters are placed would be treated in this way, the first scenario described above would be relevant to relatively few newborns. The second scenario described above would be the more common one encountered.</P>
<P>One non-randomised (quasi-randomised) trial was found for inclusion in this review. Pulido et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pulido-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Pulido 1985</LINK>) performed a small study on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in infants undergoing transfusion procedures for hyperbilirubinaemia or polycythaemia via an umbilical venous catheter. The authors conclude that no infant in the study developed septicaemia following the procedure, and that the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. A study of this size would have been underpowered to detect anything other than a very large effect. The study covered a period of only two months. It has been noted previously that nosocomial infections can occur in clusters (<LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2002</LINK>). If the study under consideration here coincided with a nadir in nosocomial infection, then the resultant underestimation of septicaemia rates in one or both arms of the study could have affected the conclusions. It is difficult to generalise the findings of this study for a number of reasons. Since its publication there have been significant changes in the practice of neonatal medicine, including use and maintenance of vascular access devices. The use of umbilical venous catheters in this study was for specific indications and the background risk of infection in the study subjects may have been low. The average age at catheter insertion in this study was probably significantly greater than would be seen in most units today. Given the poor methodological quality of the study, we cannot rely on the results provided with regard to effects on infection rates.</P>
<P>Quasi-randomised trials are inherently prone to bias, and their results should be interpreted with caution. The alternate group assignment makes the upcoming treatment group allocation predictable, and that is a problem in the case of every eligible infant. Also, if two equally eligible infants present at the same time with different risks for infection a clinician might (consciously or not) enter them into the study in the order that would allow the infant that they believed should receive antibiotics to get antibiotics. If a large number of infants were enrolled in this way, serious imbalance in the treatment groups with respect to factors affecting the outcome would result (<LINK REF="REF-Hennekens-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennekens 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to justify the use of prophylactic antibiotics (rather than treatment of infection as it arises) in infants with umbilical venous catheters, there should be evidence that the benefit outweighs the harm. This should include an adequate assessment not only of short term outcomes such as infection rate and duration of hospital admission, but also of long term outcomes such as mortality, long term respiratory morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>Theoretical concerns about the potential harm of prophylactic antibiotic use include emergence of resistant strains of bacteria, superinfection and drug toxicity. Altered antibiotic resistance patterns may be of consequence not only to the individual in whom prophylactic antibiotics are used but also to other patients within the hospital setting and to the broader community.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence from published clinical trials to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics when inserting umbilical venous catheters in newborn infants.</LI>
<LI>There is no evidence from clinical trials to support or refute continuing antibiotics once initial cultures rule out infection in newborn infants with umbilical venous catheters.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<UL>
<LI>If prophylactic antibiotics are to be considered when inserting umbilical venous catheters, then good quality randomised controlled trials are required to show that their benefits outweigh the harms. Unfortunately, most newborn infants who have umbilical venous catheters inserted are likely to receive antibiotics to cover possible infection and a randomised controlled trial may not be practicable or ethical.</LI>
<LI>A more pressing question is whether infants who initially receive antibiotics for presumed infection should be continued on antibiotics once initial cultures rule out infection. Good quality randomised controlled trials are required to address this issue.</LI>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>This non-randomised (quasi-randomised - alternate allocation) study took place between July and August 1984 at a regional neonatal intensive care unit in Chile. Enrolled infants were allocated alternately into intervention and control groups. All subjects had 2 peripheral blood cultures and a full blood count (FBC) drawn three days following the procedure. At this stage antibiotics were discontinued if there was deemed to be no clinical or laboratory (i.e. FBC) evidence of infection. Blood cultures were read at 7 days. Septicaemia was defined as positive blood culture combined with clinical and laboratory evidence of infection. Intervention was probably not blinded. Completeness of follow up is not addressed. It is unclear whether outcome assessment was blinded.</P>
