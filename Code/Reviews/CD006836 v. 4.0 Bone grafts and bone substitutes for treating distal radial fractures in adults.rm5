<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Bone grafts and bone substitutes for treating distal radial fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>A 'broken wrist' (from a fracture at the lower end of the two forearm bones) often results from a fall onto an outstretched hand in older adults and from high-energy trauma, such as a road traffic accident, in young adults. Surgery may be considered for more seriously displaced fractures. Surgical treatment can involve the implantation of bone scaffolding materials (bone grafts and substitutes) into bony defects that may affect the stability of the fracture fragments after they have been put back into place.</P>
<P>This review looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of bone scaffolding.</P>
<P>Ten very different trials involving 874 adults with generally unstable fractures were grouped into six comparisons. No trial used a best-practice method for preventing selection bias.</P>
<P>Four trials (239 participants) found implantation of bone scaffolding (autogenous - from the patient - bone graft (one trial); Norian SRS - a bone substitute (two trials); methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) improved anatomical outcomes compared with plaster cast alone; and two found it improved function. Reported complications of bone scaffolding were transient discomfort resulting from deposits of Norian SRS outside the bone. One deposit required surgical removal.</P>
<P>One trial (323 participants) comparing Norian SRS versus plaster cast or external fixation found no difference in functional or anatomical outcomes at one year. External deposits of bone cement and pin track infection were the only significant differences between the two groups.</P>
<P>One trial (48 participants) found that autogenous (from the patient) bone graft in the context of external fixation did not significantly change outcome. There was one serious donor-site complication.</P>
<P>One trial (21 participants) found some indication of worse outcomes with bone cement compared with percutaneous (through the skin) pinning.</P>
<P>Three trials (180 participants) found bone scaffolding (autogenous bone graft (one trial); Norian SRS (one trial); methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) gave no significant difference in functional outcomes but some indication of better anatomical outcomes compared with external fixation. Most reported complications were associated with external fixation; deposits of Norian SRS outside the bone occurred in one trial.</P>
<P>One trial (93 participants treated with plate fixation) comparing allogenic bone material (from other people) versus autogenic bone-graft found slightly improved wrist function for the autograft group but an excess of complications relating to graft harvesting.</P>
<P>The review concluded that while bone scaffolding may improve anatomical outcome compared with plaster cast immobilisation alone, there is insufficient evidence to conclude on function and safety; or on outcome for other comparisons.</P>

Each review will provide updated evidence for one of the several surgical categories that are presented together in the currently available review (Handoll 2003a).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition: distal radial fracture in adults</HEADING>
<P>Fractures of the distal radius, often referred to as "wrist fractures", are common in both children and adults. They are usually defined as occurring in the distal radius within three centimetres of the radiocarpal joint, where the lower end of the radius interfaces with two (the lunate and the scaphoid) of the eight bones forming the carpus (the wrist). The majority are closed injuries, the overlying skin remaining intact.</P>
<P>Distal radial fractures are one of the most common fractures in adults, occurring predominantly in white and older populations in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Sahlin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahlin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>). In women, the incidence increases with age from around 40 years. Before this age, the incidence is higher in men (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>). A multi-centre study in the United Kingdom of patients aged 35 years and above with distal radius fracture reported an annual incidence of 9/10,000 in men and 37/10,000 in women (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Young adults usually sustain this injury as a result of high-energy trauma, such as a road traffic accident. In older adults, especially females, the fracture more often results from low-energy or moderate trauma, such as falling from standing height. This reflects the greater fragility of the bone, resulting from osteoporosis. It has been estimated that, at 50 years of age, a white woman in the USA or Northern Europe has a 15% lifetime risk of a distal radius fracture whereas a man has a lifetime risk of just over two per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>). More recent estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Staa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Staa 2001</LINK>) of lifetime risk of radius or ulna fracture at 50 years of age are similar: 16.6% for women versus 2.9% for men.</P>
<P>Distal radial fractures are usually treated on an outpatient basis. It is estimated that around 20% of patients (mainly older people) require hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). This figure includes all people receiving surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Classification</HEADING>
<P>Surgeons have classified fractures by anatomical configuration and fracture pattern to help in their management. Simple classifications were based on clinical appearance and often named after those who described them. In the distal radius, the term "Colles' fracture" is still used for a fracture in which there is an obvious and typical clinical deformity (commonly referred to as a 'dinner fork deformity') - dorsal displacement, dorsal angulation, dorsal comminution (fragmentation), and radial shortening. The introduction of X-rays and other imaging methods made it clear that the characteristic deformity may be associated with a range of different fracture patterns, which may be important determinants of outcome, and therefore the way in which treatment is conducted. For example, the fracture through the distal radius may be extra-articular (leaving the articular or joint surface of the radius intact) or intra-articular (the articular surface is disrupted, sometimes in a complex manner). Numerous classifications have been devised to define and group different fracture patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Chitnavis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitnavis 1999</LINK>). Brief descriptions of five commonly cited classification systems are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Cooney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooney 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frykman-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frykman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melone 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Older-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Older 1965</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention: bone grafts and bone graft substitutes</HEADING>
<P>In the last century, most distal radius fractures in adults were treated conservatively, by reduction (the alignment of the bony fragments) of the fracture when displaced, and stabilisation in a plaster cast or other external brace. The results of such treatment, particularly in older people with bones weakened by osteoporosis, are not consistently satisfactory (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003b</LINK>), and surgical interventions have been developed aimed at more accurate reduction and more reliable stabilisation. However, particularly in people with osteoporotic bone, metaphyseal comminution and impaction may result in a bony void in the distal radius that may be associated with loss of reduction and malunion. This defect can be filled with some biocompatible material; for example, an autograft (autogenous bone graft) that is obtained from the patients themselves. Such bone is 'harvested' or extracted from a donor site; usually the iliac crest (a part of the pelvic girdle). However, autograft harvesting carries a significant risk of complication, including donor site pain, haematoma, infection and nerve injury (<LINK REF="REF-Arrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrington 1996</LINK>). A common alternative is an allograft (allogenic bone graft), obtained from cadaveric donors or live donors undergoing procedures such as total hip replacement. This avoids the morbidity associated with autografts but adds the risks of disease transmission and of engendering an immune response. However, the preparation of allografts (sterilisation and freeze drying for safe storage) reduces the antigenicity (induced immune response) but also eliminates bone-forming cellular elements and reduces structural performance. Synthetic alternatives eliminate the risk of disease transmission but their properties vary considerably. Some, such as bone cement, are essentially space fillers and do not bond to the bone; others such as bioresorbable ceramics act as temporary scaffolds for new bone (osteoconduction) and are then absorbed during the healing process (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2007</LINK>). Bone grafts or substitutes are generally insufficient to maintain fracture reduction on their own and are often combined with fracture fixation such as Kirschner wires, plates and screws, or external fixators (typically metal pins or screws driven into the bone on either side of the fracture via small skin incisions and fixed externally with a plaster cast or an external fixator frame).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications </HEADING>
<P>Complications from this injury are frequent (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK>). Some are associated with the injury itself: as well as concomitant injuries to soft tissues, fracture displacement can further compromise blood vessels, tendons and nerves, with median nerve dysfunction being the most common complication (<LINK REF="REF-Belsole-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsole 1993</LINK>). The etiology of complex regional pain syndrome type 1, also termed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), algodystrophy, Sudeck's atrophy and shoulder-hand syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1996</LINK>), is often unclear. RSD is a major complication (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2003</LINK>) requiring many months of physiotherapy to alleviate symptoms (pain and tenderness, impairment of joint mobility, swelling, dystrophy (muscle wasting), vasomotor instability (poor control of blood vessel dilation)) in serious cases. Late complications include adaptive carpal instability (dynamic instability resulting from malalignment of distal radius and carpal bones within the wrist that is associated with pain, decreased grip strength and clicking) and post-traumatic arthritis which can occur several months or years after injury (<LINK REF="REF-Knirk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knirk 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taleisnik-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taleisnik 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications can also result from treatment and include residual finger stiffness resulting from faulty application of plaster casts (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), and infection and tissue-damage from surgery. Specific complications for bone grafts and substitutes include donor site morbidity for autografts, disease transmission from allografts, and problems resulting from soft-tissue and intra-articular deposits of bone substitute materials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review?</HEADING>
<P>A bony void is common after the reduction of many distal radial fractures. It is important to determine if inserting bone grafts and bone substitutes into this bony defect affects outcome, particularly in terms of function and adverse effects, either versus conservative treatment or surgical fixation or as an adjunct to methods of surgical fixation. The answer to this question is likely to depend on fracture configuration, bone quality and other patient factors.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-01 16:46:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of implanting bone scaffolding materials (bone grafts or bone substitutes) into bony defects resulting from fracture of the distal radius in skeletally mature people.</P>
<P>More specifically, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>implanting bone scaffolding versus conservative treatment or surgical fixation (percutaneous pinning or external fixation or combinations of these);</LI>
<LI>implanting bone scaffolding used in conjunction with any method of surgical fixation versus the same method of surgical fixation alone;</LI>
<LI>different methods of bone scaffolding;</LI>
<LI>different types and durations of immobilisation after bone scaffolding.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We consider outcome primarily in terms of patient-assessed functional outcome and satisfaction, and other measures of function and impairment, pain and discomfort, the incidence of complications, anatomical deformity and use of resources.</P>
<P>Our intention to study the outcomes in different age groups and for different fracture types, especially whether they are extra-articular or intra-articular, was prevented by the lack of data and variation in the trial characteristics.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-01 16:54:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered all randomised or quasi-randomised (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number, alternation) controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of bone grafts or substitutes for treating distal radial fractures in adults.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Skeletally mature patients of either sex with a fracture of the distal radius were included. Trials containing adults and children would have been included provided the proportion of children was clearly small (&lt; 5%), or separate data for adults could be obtained. Trials containing different fracture types would have been included only if separate data were available for participants with distal radial fractures. Also included were trials recruiting people whose fractures had redisplaced within two weeks of conservative management. An exception was made regarding this last criterion in the inclusion of a trial of that recruited patients whose fractures had redisplaced after a second reduction between 14 and 18 days after injury. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of implanting bone scaffolding materials into bony defects resulting from fracture of the distal radius in adults. This included the following comparisons.<BR/>(1) Implantation of bone grafts or substitutes alone versus conservative interventions such as plaster cast immobilisation.<BR/>(2) Implantation of bone grafts or substitutes along with surgical fixation (percutaneous pinning, external fixation, internal fixation or combinations of these) versus the same method of surgical fixation alone.<BR/>(3) Implantation of bone grafts or substitutes alone versus surgical fixation (percutaneous pinning, external fixation, or combinations of these).<BR/>(4) Comparisons evaluating different types of bone scaffolding (e.g. autografts versus allografts; grafts versus bone substitutes; bioabsorbable versus bio-inert substitute materials). This does not include comparisons of different preparations or compositions of the same broad category of bone substitutes.<BR/>(5) Comparisons evaluating different types and durations of immobilisation after bone scaffolding.</P>
<P>For the first three comparisons, the use of supplementary pinning solely to secure the placement of grafts/scaffolding was considered on a case by case basis.</P>
<P>We included trials in which surgery involving the insertion of bone grafts or substitutes took place up to 18 days after initial conservative management.</P>
<P>This review does not cover bone tissue engineering and thus we have not included trials testing bone scaffolding materials that are being used as delivery systems for biological agents, such as bone morphogenic proteins, involved in the bone remodelling process (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2007</LINK>). Although no trials were found, we also would have excluded trials evaluating different surgical techniques associated with implantation of bone scaffolding; this decision may be revisited in the future.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-01 18:10:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Both review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the newly included trial using a pre-piloted form. One author (HH) repeated her assessment of the trials already included in <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>. All disagreements were resolved by discussion. Titles of journals, names of authors or supporting institutions were not masked at any stage. A modification of the quality assessment tool used in the current 'umbrella' review was used. Instead of scores, each item was graded either 'Y', '?' or 'N', respectively indicating that the quality criteria were met for the item ("Yes"), or possibly or only partially met for the item ("Possible, partial"), or not met ("No"). The rating scheme covering 11 aspects of trial validity plus brief notes of coding guidelines for selected items are given in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>

<P>The unit of randomisation in these trials is usually the individual patient. Exceptionally, as in the case of trials including people with bilateral fractures, data for trials may be presented for fractures or limbs rather than individual patients.

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-08-01 18:10:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Where possible, we performed intention-to-treat analyses to include all people randomised to the intervention groups. The investigation of the effect of drop outs and exclusions by conducting best and worst scenario analyses was either not possible or not warranted. We were alert to the potential mislabelling or non-identification of standard errors for standard deviations. Unless missing standard deviations could be derived from confidence interval data, we did not assume values in order to present these in the analyses.</P>

Entry into <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> was timed after the second reduction, which took place between 8 and 14 days after the first closed reduction in the first trial and between 14 and 18 days after injury in the second trial. The remaining trials involved primary treatment of people with acute fractures. It is likely that all fractures in these trials were closed; this was explicitly stated in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK>.

The tenth trial tested a new comparison, whereby the control group was either conservative treatment or external fixation. There were no trials evaluating immobilisation after bone scaffolding (comparison 5 in 'Types of interventions'). A concise summary of the trial participants, fracture types, timing and details of the interventions is given in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.

Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>) recruited patients with fractures that had redisplaced while <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> involved primary treatment of acute fractures. <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> included only extra-articular fractures. The bone scaffolding material was autogenous bone graft fixed by a Kirschner wire in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>, a calcium-phosphate bone cement marketed under the name Norian SRS (Norian skeletal repair system) in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK>, and methylmethacrylate cement in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>. In contrast to the two other trials of redisplaced fractures (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>), no re-reduction was performed for conservatively treated patients in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>.

Though the stratification at randomisation in <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> may have allowed the splitting up of the results into two comparisons ('Bone scaffolding - bone graft/substitute - versus conservative treatment; Bone scaffolding - bone graft or substitute - versus external fixation''), this was not possible here. <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> included acute fractures only. Post-operative immobilisation in the bone scaffolding group was two weeks compared with six to eight weeks in the control group. Percutaneous wiring was used for fracture fixation in 40% (64/161) of the bone substitute group and 51% (82/162) of the control group.</P>

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Widman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Widman 2002</LINK>) evaluated the filling of the bone defect with an autogenous bone graft in the context of external fixation in 48 people. However, the interventions allocated to the two groups in <LINK REF="STD-Widman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Widman 2002</LINK> also differed in other important ways. Application of an external fixator, reduction under fluoroscopic control, bone grafting and open reduction of displaced fragments were performed under general anaesthesia in one group. In this group, the external fixator was removed after three weeks and replaced by a plaster cast allowing volar flexion (wrist could be bent downwards) for the following three weeks. In the other group, closed reduction and application of an external fixator were performed using intravenous regional anaesthesia; the fixator was removed after six weeks.</P>

Potentially important imbalances in gender (<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>) and age (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>) between the two treatment groups were reasons for a '?' rating for these two trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding of patients and treatment providers</B> (items 5 and 6)<BR/>These are unlikely in these studies and none was claimed.</P>
<P>
<B>Care programme comparability</B> (item 7)<BR/>We found it difficult to confirm comparability of care programmes, including surgical experience, other than the trial interventions.

<BR/>Description of inclusion criteria </B>(item 8)<BR/>All the included trials were considered to have provided sufficient trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to define their study populations.</P>
<P>
<B>Definition and quality of outcome measurement</B> (items 9 and 10)<BR/>Outcome measurement was sufficiently well described in all of the included trials except <LINK REF="STD-Jeyam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeyam 2002</LINK>. Only <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> was rated as having 'optimal' quality outcome measurement, which included use of validated patient assessed quality of life instruments and active follow up. The variety of outcome measures reported by the trials is evident from inspection of the 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>
<B>Length of follow up</B> (item 11)<BR/>Follow up ranged from six months (<LINK REF="STD-Jeyam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeyam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>) to two years (<LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>).</P>

Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>) recruited patients whose fractures had redisplaced. <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> only included extra-articular fractures. Importantly, the redisplaced fractures of control group patients were not re-reduced in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>. Further details, revealing other differences, of the trials are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>The data presented for grip strength and range of motion (<I>see </I>Analyses 01.03 and 01.07) for the two groups of <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> were consistent with the conclusion of no significant difference in functional results stated in the trial report. No difference between the two groups in the patients' rating of impairment of hand function was also reported, but without supporting data, in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> reported that the small differences between the two groups in mean grip strength (at six months: 70% versus 72% relative to the contralateral arm) and mobility were not statistically significant at any of the follow-up times. Both functional scoring systems used by <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> rated deformity and, for <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>, various complications. Superior functional grades were obtained in the bone substitute group in these two trials, with significantly more bone substitute group patients obtaining excellent or good results (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.01). The results for fair or poor functional gradings in the two trials were markedly different (I² = 81.8%) although favouring the bone scaffolding groups in both trials. Though these data are not pooled, it should be noted that pooling using the random-effects model yields a statistically non-significant result (Fair or poor functional grading: relative risk (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.65). These results reflected the better grip strength and range of motion in the bone substitute group of both trials (<I>see</I> Analyses 01.03, 01.06, 01.07). Though assessed there were no pain results given in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean visual analogue pain scores, both low, at six months in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analyses 01.04). There were statistically significantly more people experiencing pain in the control groups of <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.05).</P>
<P>Complications suffered by the participants of the four trials are presented in Analysis 01.08. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in most complications (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome, tendon rupture, infection, RSD). However, recurrent instability was found statistically significantly more often in the conservative treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> (3/30 versus 16/30; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58), and likewise, displacement requiring secondary treatment occurred in the majority (38/55) of conservatively treated participants of <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK>. But, the first observation should be moderated by the over-correction or further collapse of volar tilt in seven bone graft wrists in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>. Similarly, the same number (38/55) of bone substitute patients in <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> had soft-tissue deposits of bone cement, many of which gave transient discomfort. Eighteen of these were still present at follow up. Another deposit within the joint had to be removed surgically. <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> did not report the long-term outcome of the three bone substitute patients whose post-operative pain was attributed to soft-tissue extrusion of bone cement. <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> reported that the bone cement was surrounded by cortical bone in all cases. <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> did not report on donor-site complications.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK>, most of the conservatively treated fractures redisplaced requiring remanipulation and a new plaster cast (38/55). Further fracture displacement occurred in both groups of <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>; this was, however, from different starting positions since re-reduction was only done in the bone substitute group. At six months, anatomical measurements were indicated as being statistically significantly better in the operative group of <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> (mean dorsal angle: 6 versus 24 degrees; mean ulnar variance: 2 mm versus 4 mm). Superior long-term anatomical results in the bone scaffolding group were also reported in the other three trials. The differences between the operative and control groups in the retention of the restored (<LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK>) or improved (<LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>) dorsal angulation after reduction were statistically significant. This is shown in Analysis 01.10, and reported by <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> (mean volar angle: 3.6 versus -3.2 degrees; P &lt; 0.01). The mean radial shortening was reported to be statistically significantly lower in <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> (mean radial shortening: 3.8 mm versus 6.1 mm; P &lt; 0.01) and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> (1.38 mm versus 5.61 mm) but no difference was found in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.09 ). Data for these anatomical outcomes were not pooled given the highly significant heterogeneity (I² = 96.7% and 90.2% respectively for Analyses 01.09 and 01.10). Mean losses in ulnar variance (0.77 mm versus 2.44 mm) and increases in radial width (0.58 mm versus 1.35 mm) were also reported to be statistically significant by <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK>. These results were reflected by the significantly greater numbers of wrists meeting the criteria for malunion in the conservative treatment groups of <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez_x002d_Sotelo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez-Sotelo 2000</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.11: 20/85 versus 43/85; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.71); and in the numbers of people (0/24 versus 15/23) who were dissatisfied with the appearance of their wrist at long-term follow up in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK> (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.11). Most patients accepted their wrist deformity in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>, however, one control group patient with a painful malunion requested and underwent a corrective osteotomy at eight months. There was no significant difference between the two groups of <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> in the numbers of people with carpal collapse (11/30 versus 14/30).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> compared the insertion of bone substitute (Norian SRS bone cement) into the radial metaphyseal defect with immobilisation in a plaster cast or external fixator in 323, mainly older and female patients with acute extra-articular or intra-articular fractures. Supplementary percutaneous wiring was used in 146 people, spread over the two groups. Post-operative immobilisation was two weeks in the bone substitute versus six to eight weeks in the control group. The following account of the results of this trial incorporates the results from the two key reports of the trial; the earlier one (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1998</LINK>) being produced through the Federal Drug Agency (USA).</P>
<P>Data were not available for the various quality of life and hand function measures collected in <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>, which reported that while early findings, before eight weeks, significantly favoured the bone substitute group, there were no differences between the groups at one year. Based on the presence of unsuccessful (more than 10% difference from normal side) individual outcomes of functional impairment, only two participants, both of the bone substitute group, were considered in the FDA report to have an unsuccessful functional outcome (<I>see </I>Analysis 02.01). However, this seems inconsistent with the results for grip strength, the primary functional outcome in this trial, where both groups had mean discrepancies of over 10% (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.02: RR -0.60%, 95% CI -6.31% to 5.11%). Significantly fewer participants of the bone substitute group reported pain at two and four weeks after their treatment (reported P = 0.02) and required less post-operative pain medication. There was, however, no significant difference between the two groups in pain (listed under complications) at one year follow up (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.03: 4/161 versus 10/162; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.26). There were no significance differences between the two groups in range of motion outcomes (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.04). Again, the results presented in <LINK REF="REF-FDA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1998</LINK> for the very few people with motion deficits above 10% (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.05) seem at odds with the data in Analysis 02.04.</P>
<P>The complications suffered by the participants of <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> are presented in Analysis 02.06. Marginally fewer participants of the bone substitute group experienced one or more complication (74/161 versus 82/162; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.14). However, aside from four people with intra-articular deposits, people with initial (112/161; 70%) or persistent (29/161; 18%) extraosseous deposits of bone cement, which may have caused some discomfort, were not included in these figures. The significant excess of infection in the conventional treatment group (3/161 versus 25/162; RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.39) was due to pin track infections in patients with external fixators; these were of undefined diagnosis and outcome. No other differences between the two groups reached statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> observed that the total number of complications were significantly lower for bone substitute group participants without extraosseous material compared to those with extraosseous material.</P>
<P>The difference between the two groups in the average loss in radial length, the primary radiological outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>, was not statistically significant (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.07). Similarly, there were no differences for radial or dorsal angulation. As reported in <LINK REF="REF-FDA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1998</LINK>, similar numbers in the two groups had an unsuccessful radiological outcome overall (<I>see </I>Analysis 02.08: 71/133 versus 66/138; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.41). However, more participants of the bone substitute had a substantial change in dorsal angulation (<I>see </I>Analysis 02.08), and notably significantly more had a dorsal angle of over 10 degrees (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.08: 42/133 versus 28/136; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.32). Again, the results presented in FDA 1998 seem at odds with those in <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.07).

The few complications reported are presented in Analysis 03.04. Surgery was required to resolve one case of deep pin-track infection and one case with carpal tunnel syndrome in the control group. Surgery was also undertaken for the single case of superficial painful granuloma in the bone graft group. A serious bleed at the donor site for the bone graft ceased after compression. It is possible that more minor donor site complications were not reported in <LINK REF="STD-Widman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Widman 2002</LINK>.

Data were unavailable for two people who died and one who was treated with a non-standard Kapandji technique. At six months follow up, the mean loss in grip strength relative to the patient's uninjured hand was reported to be statistically significantly greater in the bone substitute group (mean loss: 44% versus 27%). There was little difference reported for range of movement parameters at six months follow up except for palmar flexion, which was significantly less in the bone substitute group (<I>see</I> Analysis 04:01: mean difference -10.00 degrees, 95% CI -18.89 to -1.11 degrees). No complications occurred in either group. Dorsal angulation was reported to be statistically significantly worse in the bone substitute group (median 10 versus -4 degrees; P &lt; 0.02), but the differences between the two groups in radial angle and ulnar variance were slight and reported not to be statistically significant. None of the participants took up the offer of a revision procedure for malunion.</P>

<I>Bone scaffolding - bone graft or substitute - versus external fixation</I>
</B>
<BR/>Three trials compared the use of autogenous bone graft (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>) or different bone substitutes (<LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 1999</LINK>: Norian SRS; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK>: methylmethacrylate cement) versus external fixation in 180 mainly older and female patients with redisplaced fractures. <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> only included extra-articular fractures. Further details of these trials that show the differences in the trial populations and interventions are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Aside from some complications, no pooling of data was possible for the various outcome measures reported for these trials.</P>
<P>Where functional outcome and impairment were reported, all three trials found no statistically significant differences between the two groups at one year follow up. This was evident for overall functional grades, which also rated deformity, in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.01); for grip strength in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analyses 05.02) and <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.03); for pain (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.04); and range of motion outcomes (<I>see</I> Analyses 05.05 and 05.06). <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 1999</LINK> reported a significantly earlier recovery in the bone substitute group of grip strength (mean grip strength at 7 weeks: 108 N versus 65 N) and range of motion: extension (43 versus 27 degrees) and supination (69 versus 53 degrees) at seven weeks. Similar findings of an earlier regain of function in the bone substitute group were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK>; in both bone substitute trials these findings reflect the constriction of movement during external fixation. For instance, eight patients in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> were unable to clench their fist on removal of the fixator around five to six weeks whereas all people in the bone substitute group could clench their fists at all times.</P>
<P>Complications suffered by the participants of the three trials are presented in Analysis 05.07. The majority of complications or complaints were associated with external fixation. Though there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in common complications such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendon rupture and RSD, there was a notable excess of patients in the external fixator group with RSD in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>; and of trial participants with swollen wrists and persistent finger stiffness in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 1999</LINK>. Seven of the eight people in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> had early problems with finger movements after the removal of their external fixator had no problems two weeks later. Although recurrent instability was found statistically significantly more often in the external fixation group in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>, this finding should be moderated by the over-correction or further collapse of volar tilt in seven bone graft wrists. The incidence of extraosseous deposits of bone cement was not quantified by <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 1999</LINK>; however it was suggested that the tendon rupture in the bone substitute group could have resulted from attrition by the bone cement. <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> reported that the bone cement was surrounded by cortical bone in all cases. <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> did not report on donor-site complications.</P>
<P>Retention of reduced dorsal angulation was superior in the bone graft group in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.09, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in radial shortening, malunion or carpal collapse (<I>see</I> Analyses 05.08 and 05.11). There was a "mild loss of fracture reduction over time" in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 1999</LINK>: radial angle (4 versus 1 degrees); dorsal angle (4 versus 0.5 degrees); ulnar variance 2.7 mm versus 1.3 mm). Only the difference in the loss in ulnar variance reached statistical significance; the loss being higher in the bone substitute group. However, the bone substitute group started with a better initial reduced position, stated as being due to open rather than closed reduction, and the two groups ended up with similar anatomical results. Increases in dorsal angulation and radial shortening after treatment occurred in marginally more external fixator patients in <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> but this was not statistically significant (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.10). Dissatisfaction with wrist appearance resolved quicker in the bone substitute group but the two people in the external fixator group who were dissatisfied at three months did not register a complaint at six months (<I>see</I> Analysis 05.11).</P>

At one year follow up, similar numbers of participants in the two groups reported restrictions in everyday life resulting from their injury (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.01: 5/44 versus 6/46; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65). Based on a functional assessment scheme that included consideration of deformity and complications (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the numbers with either a non-excellent result or only a fair result (no participant had a poor result): <I>see </I>Analysis 06.02.</P>
<P>The number of workers was not given but none failed to return to their previous work: the return to work took longer in the autograft group (11.1 weeks versus 16.2 weeks; statistical significance not stated). Recovery of grip strength tended to be better in the autograft group (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.03). There was no significant difference in the numbers with residual wrist pain (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.04: 4/44 versus 7/46; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.90). Wrist mobility tended to be better in the autograft group, however, the differences between the groups were fairly small (<I>see </I>Analysis 06.05); no data for flexion were given in the trial report.</P>
<P>Aside from removal of plate because of limited wrist mobility, there were no other complications reported for the wrist surgery. However, there were many complications from the iliac crest harvesting in the autograft group. Half of these patients suffered post-operative pain, which was both intense and restricted mobility in 12 of these. The person who sustained a tear off of the anterior superior iliac spine was treated conservatively. Of the eight people who had an haematoma, one had an infection and two had a seroma that required drainage. At one year, six people had discomforting sensations, two of whom had complete loss of sensibility of the lateral upper thigh. Thirteen people still reported pain (six had discomforting pain) at one year from the iliac crest surgery. Similar numbers in the two groups indicated that they were dissatisfied with their outcome (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.07: 14/44 versus 18/46; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.43). Consistent with the additional procedure, the surgery took 28 minutes longer in the supplementary pinning group (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.10). There was no difference between the two groups in the length of hospital stay (<I>see</I> Analysis 06.11).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-01 18:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>While several of the main choices available for bone implantation after distal radial fracture in adults were addressed by the 10 randomised controlled trials (874 participants) included so far in this review, as we examine below no definite conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence. The two oldest trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK>), conducted by the same investigator tested methylmethacrylate cement, a material which few nowadays would use for these fractures because it does not stimulate new bone growth and may indeed inhibit it (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2007</LINK>). There is a general view of the undesirability of the use of such biologically inert materials as well as the risk of thermal necrosis of the cellular components of host bone and the effect on healing (<LINK REF="REF-Mjoberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjoberg 1984</LINK>). Thus, there is even less evidence available with the potential to inform current practice.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review methods</HEADING>
<P>As this review abided by the criteria and methods set out in a published protocol, we have restricted our comments to two issues. The first is whether trials have been missed or inappropriately excluded in our search and selection processes. The second concerns decisions about pooling.</P>
<P>Our search was comprehensive and built on searches carried out over many years (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>) prior to the development of our review. It has included the handsearch of conference proceedings and checks for ongoing trials. An inclusive and benefit-of-doubt approach during trial searches has been maintained throughout by the lead author (HH). Additionally, trial authors of unpublished trials have been sent requests for information and trial reports. It is possible that we have missed some potentially eligible trials but, if so, these may still not be suitable for inclusion, particularly if unpublished and inadequately reported. We guarded against study selection bias by the independent selection of eligible trials by both review authors.</P>
<P>Where data were available, we were sparing in our decisions to pool data and especially in instances of evident heterogeneity in the study populations and interventions. While we pooled complications, it is notable that the latter were usually poorly defined and their severity is likely to differ between trials (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review evidence</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the available evidence is limited in scope and quantity, and is of uncertain validity. For several trials, the usual reservations of the reliability of evidence from small and underpowered trials apply. Especially, we were careful to avoid miss-interpreting inconclusive evidence as 'evidence of no effect'. Systematic bias, in the form of selection, performance, exclusion or assessment bias, or a combination of these could not be ruled out for any trial. Three trials were quasi-randomised and concealment of allocation was not confirmed in the other trials. Another limitation was the inadequate assessment of outcome, particularly of function. Non-validated outcome measures, and especially those, such as that of Gartland and Werley (<LINK REF="REF-Gartland-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartland 1951</LINK>), based on scoring systems that combine aspects of function, pain, deformity and complications are particularly crude indicators of outcome. Considerable caution is needed when interpreting these and other outcomes when the scores have been reduced into categories such as excellent, good, fair or poor. Many trials predated the development of validated patient functional assessment instruments such as Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermid 2000</LINK>). These help to standardise functional assessment in a meaningful way and assist interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Amadio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amadio 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> shows, however, that even if such outcomes are collected there is no guarantee that they are reported. Questions also arise on the reliability of measures of grip strength and range of motion. A particular aspect, as related above, is the inconsistency in the presentation of these outcomes in the first full report of <LINK REF="REF-FDA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>The harvesting of bone from the iliac crest should be considered part of the intervention for autogenous grafts and hence the absence of information on this in <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK> is an important omission. Also important is the general lack of information on resource use, including the costs of bone substitute materials and applications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability of the review evidence</HEADING>
<P>Generalising the findings of the included trials, should these be valid, is hampered by inadequate reporting of study details, such as the type and severity of the fracture, and bone quality. The variety of fracture classification systems, with associated issues of reliability and validity further complicates this area (<LINK REF="REF-Jupiter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jupiter 1997</LINK>). However, there is no doubt about the instability of many, if not most, of the fractures included in these trials and especially those of five trials that exclusively included redisplaced fractures. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK>), trial entry was timed after the second reduction.</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rajan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Widman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Widman 2002</LINK>) included some younger adults who are likely to have sustained high-trauma injuries in 'normal' bone. However, most of the data in these trials are from older people with low trauma injuries. It is thus questionable whether these results apply to injuries in a younger age group, where the functional demands may be greater, acceptance of cosmetic deformity less and different decisions on choice of surgery and surgical method may occur.</P>
<P>Surgical intervention is generally complex, with a myriad of techniques and devices available, and variation too in the overall care programmes. While, as shown in this review, trials may have aspects in common such as comparing bone scaffolding with external fixation, the ways they achieve this may be very different. Should there be sufficient evidence to inform the choice inherent in such a comparison, it is only the basic question that is addressed. There remains the issue of the best way to achieve this (i.e. what bone scaffolding; or what fixator?). This consideration applies to the choice of pinning method in <LINK REF="STD-Jeyam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeyam 2002</LINK>; the Kapandji method used in this trial has been noted for an excess of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2007</LINK>). Duration of immobilisation is also a particular issue in this review. Several trials opted for a reduction in the duration of immobilisation in the bone scaffolding group relative to the control group. Early functional gains may result as in <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmalholz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Schmalholz 1990</LINK> but these are not necessarily reflected in the long term (<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neither requirements were met in <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK>, a small and prematurely terminated trial where early mobilisation was employed in both groups. <LINK REF="STD-Kopylov-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kopylov 2002</LINK> concluded that re-reduction and bone substitution of redisplaced fractures was unnecessary where people were prepared to accept cosmetic deformity and the option of later corrective surgery. Though providing an important perspective, particularly in the context of patient expectations and preferences, the evidence base for this trial is still too small.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>A summary of the conclusions of effectiveness drawn from the findings of each comparison is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>. Here, the effectiveness of each intervention relative to the 'control' intervention in each comparison is graded according to the categories of effectiveness described in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. A concise summary of the participants and interventions for the 10 trials is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. For the first comparison, the three different types of bone scaffolding are presented separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some evidence that bone scaffolding may improve anatomical outcome compared with plaster cast immobilisation alone but there is insufficient evidence on functional outcome and safety. There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of bone scaffolding supplementary to external fixation, or relative to percutaneous pinning or to external fixation; or of different methods of bone scaffolding.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The evidence base for the management of distal radius fracture in adults is limited. Further research should be preceded by agreement on the priority questions for the management of these fractures, and be addressed through large multi-centre trials (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003c</LINK>). As well as adequately powered and methodologically robust studies, any research on bone scaffolding materials must adequately record and report complications, including those relating to harvesting of autografts if appropriate. </P>

<P>This review was initiated by Helen Handoll (HH) who prepared the first draft of the protocol. This was critically reviewed by the other author, Adam Watts (AW). HH searched for trials and contacted trial authors. Both authors performed study selection of trials that had not been included in a previous review covering all surgical interventions. HH repeated her review of the other included trials that had been quality assessed previously by HH and Rajan Madhok (see Acknowledgements). HH completed the first draft of the review in RevMan. All versions were scrutinised by AW. Helen Handoll is the guarantor of the review.</P>

<P>This system is organised in order of increasing fracture severity. It divides the fractures into three major groups: group A (extra-articular), group B (simple/partial intra-articular), and group C (complex/complete intra-articular). These three groups are then subdivided, yielding 27 different fracture types.</P>

<TD>
<P>Frykman<BR/>(Frykman 1967)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This system distinguishes between extra-articular fractures and intra-articular fractures of the radiocarpal and radio-ulnar joints, and the presence or absence of an associated distal ulnar (ulnar styloid) fracture. There are 8 types labelled I to VIII (1 to 8): the higher the number, the greater complexity of the fracture.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There is no assessment of the extent or direction of fracture displacement, or of comminution.</P>

<TD>
<P>Melone<BR/>(Melone 1993)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This system identifies 5 fracture types, based on 4 major fracture components: the radial shaft, the radial styloid, and the dorsal-medial and volar-medial fragments.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This is for intra-articular fractures only.</P>

<P>Older<BR/>(Older 1965)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This system divides fractures into 4 types, labelled I to VI (1 to 4) of increasing severity. The types are defined according to extent of displacement (angulation and radial shortening) and comminution.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There is no consideration of radio-ulnar joint involvement.</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>'Universal Classification' (Cooney 1993)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This system divides fractures into 4 main types, labelled I to VI (1 to 4), distinguishing between extra-articular and intra-articular fractures and displaced and non-displaced fractures. Displaced fracture types II and IV are further subdivided based on reducibility (whether the fracture can be reduced; that is whether the bone fragments can be put back in place) and stability (whether, once reduced, the fragments will remain so).</P>

<P>This does not distinguish between the radiocarpal and radio-ulnar joints. Additionally, there is a 'trial by treatment'.</P>

<P>Bone scaffolding - bone graft - versus conservative treatment (plaster cast)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>3: Trade off between benefits and harms:</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Although the functional outcome was under-reported in one small trial of redisplaced fractures, there was evidence of better anatomical outcomes in the autogenous bone graft group. There was no report of donor site morbidity or complications but even if none occurred in this trial these can be serious and long term.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) Minimal details were provided for the conservative treatment intervention; there remains a possibility of sub-optimal application of plaster casts.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A grading of 4: unknown effectiveness could also apply to this comparison.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bone scaffolding - Norian SRS - versus conservative treatment (plaster cast)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>4: Unknown effectiveness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Not enough evidence from two heterogeneous trials, one which included only acute fractures and one which included only redisplaced fractures.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) The acute fracture trial had promising results but questions remain over complications. The extraosseous deposition of Norian SRS, which mainly caused patient discomfort, apparently reduced with improved surgical technique. There was, however, an unusually high (38/55) rate of remanipulation in the conservative treatment group.<BR/>(2) The redisplaced fracture trial was terminated early after just 20 people were recruited. The trial authors concluded that re-reduction and bone substitution of redisplaced fractures was unnecessary where people were prepared to accept cosmetic deformity and the option of later corrective surgery.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>There was earlier mobilisation in the operative group of trial of acute fractures. Early notice of these trial results favouring Norian SRS acted a spur for Cassidy 2003 (FDA trial).<BR/>
<BR/>Though providing an important perspective, particularly in the context of patient expectations and preferences, the evidence base for the trial of redisplaced fractures is still too small.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bone scaffolding - methylmethacrylate cement - versus conservative treatment (plaster cast)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>4: Unknown effectiveness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Not enough evidence from one small quasi-randomised trial of redisplaced extra-articular fractures.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) The trial results for the bone cement group were significantly more favourable for functional, pain and anatomical outcomes.<BR/>(2) Methylmethacrylate cement is a biologically inert material and generally viewed as undesirable in this situation although healing of the cortical bone around the bone cement was confirmed for all cases.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The follow up of two years for this small trial were probably not long enough to establish the long term consequences of using methylmethacrylate cement.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bone substitute versus "conventional treatment" (plaster cast or external fixation).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>4: Unknown effectiveness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Not enough evidence given the complex comparison and lack of statistically significant differences. It is likely that the claims of earlier recovery of function and pain with the bone substitute are true but the data for functional measures at the various follow-up times were incomplete</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) Met FDA (USA) safety requirements.<BR/>(2) Norian SRS was considered to be indicated for "low impact, unstable, metaphyseal distal radius fractures where early mobilisation is indicated" (FDA 1998)<BR/>(3) Many of the extraosseous deposits persisted and appeared associated with more complications. Questions remain about the long-term complications such as arthritis, potentially from intra-articular deposits, and refracture rate.<BR/>(4) There was optional use of supplementary wiring in both groups</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Complex control group and comparison hampered interpretation. Norian SRS group mobilised at 2 weeks.<BR/>
<BR/>This was an industrially sponsored trial and the clear involvement of the company making Norian SRS, including commentary by an employee in the journal publication, should be noted.</P>

<TD>
<P>Bone graft, external fixation then plaster cast versus external fixation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>4: Unknown effectiveness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Not enough evidence from one small trial</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) The invasive nature of bone graft harvesting and of bone graft insertion should not be overlooked.<BR/>(2) It is likely that the less serious donor-site complications were not reported.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Though presented as a trial of primary bone grafting, the trial should be viewed in terms of the actual interventions (including a difference in methods and mobilisation after 3 weeks) under comparison.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bone substitute versus percutaneous pinning</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>4: Unknown effectiveness</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Not enough evidence from one small and potentially flawed trial despite some evidence of poorer results for a particular bone substitute (Bonesource: hydroxapatite cement), used without additional fixation, when compared with Kapandji intrafocal pinning by experienced operators for some types (Melone 1 and 2a) of intra-articular fractures.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>(1) Melone 1 fractures are defined as "stable after closed reduction" and thus some would consider that cast immobilisation would suffice (Melome 1993).<BR/>(2) Reservations with selection of the Kapandji pinning method are given in the percutaneous pinning review (Handoll 2007)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Despite the insufficient evidence, it is still plausible that Bonesource is not mechanically robust enough to be used without supplementary fixation.</P>

<P>Not enough evidence from three small heterogeneous trials; each testing a different material: bone graft, methylmethacrylate cement and Norian SRS. All were redisplaced fractures.</P>

<TD>
<P>(1) The majority of reported complications were in the external fixation group, but there remains the potential of under-reported or long-term complications of methylmethacrylate cement and Norian SRS.<BR/>(2) The trial using bone graft did not comment on donor site complications.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Although this is a small quasi-randomised study there was some indication of better functional results for the autograft - this needs confirmation - but anyway these need to be set in the context of the serious and frequent complications recorded for the iliac crest bone extraction.</P>
</TD>
