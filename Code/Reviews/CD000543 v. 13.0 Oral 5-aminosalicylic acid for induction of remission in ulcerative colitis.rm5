<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-17 13:56:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Sulfasalazine (SASP) has been used for treating ulcerative colitis for decades. SASP is made up of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) linked to a sulfur molecule. Up to a third of patients treated with SASP have reported side effects, which are thought to be related to the sulfur part of the molecule. Common side effects associated with SASP include nausea, indigestion, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. 5-ASA drugs were developed to avoid the side effects associated with SASP. This review includes 53 randomized trials with a total of 8548 participants. Oral 5-ASA was found to be more effective than placebo (fake drug). Although oral 5-ASA drugs are effective for treating active ulcerative colitis, they are no more effective than SASP therapy. Patients taking 5-ASA are less likely to experience side effects than patients taking SASP. Side effects associated with 5-ASA are generally mild in nature, and common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea), headache and worsening ulcerative colitis. Male infertility is associated with SASP and not with 5-ASA, so 5-ASA may be preferred for patients concerned about fertility. 5-ASA compounds are more expensive than SASP, so SASP may be the preferred option where cost is an important factor. 5-ASA dosed once daily appears to be as effective and safe as conventionally dosed (two or three times daily) 5-ASA. There do not appear to be any differences in effectiveness or safety among the various 5-ASA formulations. A daily dosage of 2.4 g appears to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients with moderate disease may benefit from an initial dose of 4.8 g/day.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-12 15:36:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Claire E  Parker">
<P>Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of sulfasalazine (SASP) while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. Previously, it was found that 5-ASA drugs in doses of at least 2 g/day, were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP for inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations used for the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-05 08:24:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness and safety of oral 5-ASA compared to placebo, SASP, or 5-ASA comparators for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. A secondary objective of this systematic review was to compare the efficacy and safety of once daily dosing of oral 5-ASA with conventional (two or three times daily) dosing regimens.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-17 13:56:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>A computer-assisted literature search for relevant studies (inception to July 9, 2015) was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-09-06 13:53:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Studies were accepted for analysis if they were randomized controlled clinical trials of parallel design, with a minimum treatment duration of four weeks. Studies of oral 5-ASA therapy for treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis compared with placebo, SASP or other formulations of 5-ASA were considered for inclusion. Studies that compared once daily 5-ASA treatment with conventional dosing of 5-ASA (two or three times daily) and 5-ASA dose ranging studies were also considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-20 13:27:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The outcomes of interest were the failure to induce global/clinical remission, global/clinical improvement, endoscopic remission, endoscopic improvement, adherence, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and withdrawals or exclusions after entry. Trials were separated into five comparison groups: 5-ASA versus placebo, 5-ASA versus sulfasalazine, once daily dosing versus conventional dosing, 5-ASA versus comparator 5-ASA, and 5-ASA dose-ranging. Placebo-controlled trials were subgrouped by dosage. SASP-controlled trials were subgrouped by 5-ASA/SASP mass ratios. Once daily versus conventional dosing studies were subgrouped by formulation. 5-ASA-controlled trials were subgrouped by common 5-ASA comparators (e.g. Asacol, Claversal, Salofalk and Pentasa). Dose-ranging studies were subgrouped by 5-ASA formulation. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-21 07:40:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Fifty-three studies (8548 patients) were included. The majority of included studies were rated as low risk of bias. 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo with regard to all measured outcome variables. Seventy-one per cent of 5-ASA patients failed to enter clinical remission compared to 83% of placebo patients (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). A dose-response trend for 5-ASA was also observed. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between 5-ASA and SASP. Fifty-four per cent of 5-ASA patients failed to enter remission compared to 58% of SASP patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). No statistically significant differences in efficacy or adherence were found between once daily and conventionally dosed 5-ASA. Forty-five per cent of once daily patients failed to enter clinical remission compared to 48% of conventionally dosed patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07). Eight per cent of patients dosed once daily failed to adhere to their medication regimen compared to 6% of conventionally dosed patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.86). There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy among the various 5-ASA formulations. Fifty per cent of patients in the 5-ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 52% of patients in the 5-ASA comparator group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02). A pooled analysis of 3 studies (n = 1459 patients) studies found no statistically significant difference in clinical improvement between Asacol 4.8 g/day and 2.4 g/day used for the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis. Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the 4.8 g/day group failed to improve clinically compared to 41% of patients in the 2.4 g/day group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with moderate disease may benefit from the higher dose of 4.8 g/day. One study compared (n = 123 patients) Pentasa 4 g/day to 2.25 g/day in patients with moderate disease. Twenty-five per cent of patients in the 4 g/day group failed to improve clinically compared to 57% of patients in the 2.25 g/day group (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71). A pooled analysis of two studies comparing MMX mesalamine 4.8 g/day to 2.4 g/day found no statistically significant difference in efficacy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29). There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of adverse events between 5-ASA and placebo, once daily and conventionally dosed 5-ASA, 5-ASA and comparator 5-ASA formulation and 5-ASA dose ranging (high dose versus low dose) studies. Common adverse events included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache and worsening ulcerative colitis. SASP was not as well tolerated as 5-ASA. Twenty-nine percent of SASP patients experienced an adverse event compared to 15% of 5-ASA patients (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-06 12:21:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>5-ASA was superior to placebo and no more effective than SASP. Considering their relative costs, a clinical advantage to using oral 5-ASA in place of SASP appears unlikely. 5-ASA dosed once daily appears to be as efficacious and safe as conventionally dosed 5-ASA. Adherence does not appear to be enhanced by once daily dosing in the clinical trial setting. It is unknown if once daily dosing of 5-ASA improves adherence in a community-based setting. There do not appear to be any differences in efficacy or safety among the various 5-ASA formulations. A daily dosage of 2.4 g appears to be a safe and effective induction therapy for patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients with moderate disease may benefit from an initial dose of 4.8 g/day.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-20 14:32:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The successful management of ulcerative colitis was greatly facilitated after the introduction of sulfasalazine (SASP) by Svartz (<LINK REF="REF-Svartz-1942" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svartz 1942</LINK>). SASP is composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) linked to sulfapyridine via a diazo bond. This bond is readily cleaved by bacterial azoreductases in the colon (<LINK REF="REF-Peppercorn-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peppercorn 1972</LINK>), to yield the two components. Of these, 5-ASA has been found to be the therapeutically active component, while sulfapyridine, which is primarily absorbed into systemic circulation, is assumed to function solely as a carrier molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Azad-Khan-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azad Khan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klotz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Hees-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Hees 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration of unbound or uncoated 5-ASA revealed that it was readily absorbed in the upper jejunum and was unable to reach the colon in therapeutic concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1987</LINK>). Ingested SASP largely resists such premature absorption and thus is able to serve as a delivery system that transports the 5-ASA to the affected regions of the lower intestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1972</LINK>). While corticosteroid therapy is more effective for the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1959</LINK>) the use of SASP in maintaining remission has been well established (<LINK REF="REF-Misiewitz-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misiewitz 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite its benefits, up to 30% of patients receiving SASP have reported adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1982</LINK>). It was concluded that many were due to the sulfapyridine moiety, especially those effects found to be dose-dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Das-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1987</LINK>). This discovery spawned more than a decade of research aimed at finding alternative 5-ASA delivery systems.</P>
<P>Asacol® (Proctor and Gamble) consists of a pellet of 5-ASA destined for release in the terminal ileum or colon due to a coating known as Eudragit-S, a resin that dissolves at a pH greater than 7 (<LINK REF="REF-Dew-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dew 1982</LINK>). Claversal®/Mesasal® (Smith, Kline and French), Salofalk® (Axcan Pharma, Falk Foundation), and Rowasa® (Reid-Rowell) are similar delayed-release preparations of 5-ASA pellets coated with Eudragit L, a resin that dissolves at a pH greater than 6 (the approximate pH of the ileum/colon) (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1987</LINK>). Pentasa® (Marion-Merrell-Dow) is a microsphere formulation that consists of 5-ASA microgranules enclosed within a semi-permeable membrane of ethylcellulose. It is designed for controlled release that begins in the duodenum and continues into the affected regions of the lower bowel (<LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1982</LINK>). Olsalazine/Dipentum® (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn) consists of two 5-ASA molecules linked by a diazo bond (<LINK REF="REF-Willoughby-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willoughby 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staerk-Laursen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staerk Laursen 1990</LINK>). Other formulations, such as benzalazine, balsalazide/Colazide® (Astra Zeneca), and balsalazide disodium/Colazal® (Salix Pharmaceuticals) are composed of 5-ASA molecules azo-bonded to various benzoic acid derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleig-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fleig 1988</LINK>). Like SASP, these compounds are poorly absorbed in the upper digestive tract but are readily metabolized by the intestinal flora in the lower bowel. MMX mesalamine (Lialdaa® or Mezavant®) uses MMX Multi Matrix System (MMX) technology to delay and extend delivery of active drug throughout the colon (<LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The newer 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of SASP while maintaining its therapeutic benefits; however they are more costly and have also been shown to cause adverse effects in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1987</LINK>). The efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials that have often lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. Previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2012</LINK>), found that oral 5-ASA, in doses of at least 2 g/day, was more effective than placebo yet no more effective than SASP for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. We proceeded with this updated review in order to include more recent studies as well as to evaluate the efficacy, dose-responsiveness (including dose-ranging studies of various 5-ASA formulations), and safety of oral 5-ASA preparations compared to placebo or SASP. We also aimed to investigate any differences in efficacy and safety between various formulations of oral 5-ASA.</P>
<P>Many patients are non-adherent with conventional multi-dose (two or three times daily) treatment regimens which may result in reduced efficacy and can lead to an increased risk of relapse in patients with quiescent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2003</LINK>), a poorer long-term prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2009</LINK>) and increased healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaulieu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaulieu 2009</LINK>). Poor adherence may be particularly problematic in quiescent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2003</LINK>), since patients lack continuing symptoms that incentivize them to take medication. Although multiple factors have been shown to influence medication adherence in patients with ulcerative colitis it is commonly believed that a high pill burden and multi-dose regimens are major determinants (<LINK REF="REF-Ediger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ediger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>). Other factors affecting adherence in ulcerative colitis patients include disease extent and duration, medication costs, fear of side effects, individual psychosocial characteristics and the patient-physician relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>). Mesalamine formulations that involve once daily dosing may improve adherence and outcomes.</P>
<P>The efficacy and safety of once daily oral dosing of mesalamine compared to conventional dosing for the treatment of ulcerative colitis has been evaluated in numerous clinical trials. These trials have investigated the efficacy of once daily dosing of various formulations of mesalamine compared to conventional dosing schedules of the same drugs or different formulations. Many of these trials were small in size and lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. A secondary objective of this systematic review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once daily dosing of mesalamine compared to conventional dosing for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2012</LINK>).</P>

<B>Study Selection</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (YW or JKM or CEP) independently selected relevant studies for analysis on the basis of the inclusion criteria described above. When necessary, the original investigators were contacted to clarify points regarding trial methodology. The reasons for exclusion were indicated for each study deemed ineligible.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Collection</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (YW or JKM or CEP) independently extracted data using a standard data extraction form. We recorded results on an intention-to-treat basis, regardless of whether or not the original authors had done so. Any discrepancies between authors were settled by consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Risk of bias assessment</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (YW or JKM or CEP) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Factors assessed included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sequence generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?);</LI>
<LI>allocation sequence concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?);</LI>
<LI>blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?);</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?);</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?); and </LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias (i.e. was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study authors were contacted when insufficient information was provided to determine risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach for rating the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Randomized trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) limitations in design and implementation (risk of bias), (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate quality (i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); and very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical Methods</B>
</P>
<P>Trials were separated into five comparison groups: 5-ASA versus placebo, 5-ASA versus sulfasalazine, once daily dosing versus conventional dosing, 5-ASA versus comparator 5-ASA, and 5-ASA dose-ranging. Within each group, raw data for every measured outcome were extracted and converted into individual 2x2 tables. The tables for placebo-controlled trials were further subgrouped according to the dose of 5-ASA. The tables for SASP-controlled trials were subgrouped by 5-ASA/SASP mass ratios. The tables for the once daily versus conventional dosing studies were subgrouped by formulation. The tables for 5-ASA-controlled trials were subgrouped by common 5-ASA comparators (e.g. Asacol, Claversal, Salofalk and Pentasa). The tables for dose-ranging studies were subgrouped by 5-ASA formulation. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The results for each comparison group were pooled to determine the RR and 95% CI for each outcome resulting from 5-ASA therapy relative to either placebo, SASP or 5-ASA comparator and once daily 5-ASA therapy relative to conventional dosing. A fixed-effect model was used. Studies were pooled for analysis if patients, outcomes and interventions were similar (determined by consensus among authors). Studies comparing 5-ASA formulations were pooled for analysis if they compared equimolar doses of oral 5-ASA.</P>
<P>Dose-responsiveness was analyzed using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for trend. Trials were also subgrouped according to the specific 5-ASA preparation for those outcomes for which there were two or more studies that used a similar drug. Tests for homogeneity among trials within each comparison group were performed. The presence of heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If statistically significant heterogeneity was identified, the RR and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model. Data were not pooled for meta-analysis if a high degree of heterogeneity was identified (e.g. I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 75%). We conducted sensitivity analyses as appropriate to investigate heterogeneity. We also conducted sensitivity analyses excluding studies with a high risk of bias. All statistical analyses were performed using the Cochrane Collaboration RevMan 5 software package.</P>

Forty-eight per cent of conventionally dosed 5-ASA patients failed to enter remission compared to 45% of patients who were dosed once daily. The pooled RR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) showing no statistically significant difference between once daily dosing and conventional dosing for induction of remission (P = 0.34). None of the subgroup comparisons by formulation showed any differences in efficacy between once daily dosing and conventional dosing. However, only four formulations were evaluated in this pooled analysis. The GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (failure to induce complete global or clinical remission) was high (See <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials (n = 564 patients) reported treatment outcomes in terms of the failure to induce global or clinical improvement including remission (<LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flourie-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flourie 2013</LINK>). Thirty-seven per cent of conventionally dosed 5-ASA patients failed to improve clinically compared to 28% of patients who were dosed once daily. The pooled RR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.10) showing no statistically significant difference between once daily dosing and conventional dosing for induction of remission or clinical improvement (P = 0.13). A fair amount of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%) was detected for this comparison. A visual inspection of the forest plot indicated that the <LINK REF="STD-Flourie-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Flourie 2013</LINK> study was the likely source of the heterogeneity. When we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding this high risk of bias study the I<SUP>2</SUP> value dropped to 0%. Forty-six per cent of conventionally dosed 5-ASA patients failed to improve clinically compared to 40% of patients who were dosed once daily (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10).

The <LINK REF="STD-Green-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1998</LINK> study was not included in the pooled analysis because it enrolled patients with moderate to severe disease whereas the other studies in the pooled analysis enrolled patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The <LINK REF="STD-Green-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1998</LINK> study also allowed the use of rectal steroid foam to relieve active symptoms which was not allowed in the other 5-ASA controlled studies. The overall pooled risk ratio showed no statistically significant difference in failure to enter global or clinical remission between various formulations of 5-ASA (including Balsalazide, Pentasa, Olsalazine, MMX mesalazine; Ipocol and 5-ASA micropellets) and comparator formulations of 5-ASA (including Asacol, Claversal and Salofalk). Fifty per cent of patients in the 5-ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 52% of patients in the 5-ASA comparator group. The pooled RR of failure to induce complete global or clinical remission for all trials was 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.11) using a fixed-effect model. The GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (failure to induce complete global or clinical remission) was moderate due to a high risk of bias (lack of blinding) in two studies in the pooled analysis (See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).

An inspection of the forest plot showed that the statistically significant difference in withdrawals favoring 5-ASA over placebo was driven by the large <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2013</LINK> study, which reported that worsening of ulcerative colitis was the most common adverse event leading to withdrawal.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-04-20 14:38:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>This systematic review largely confirms the results of previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2012</LINK>), but differs from the previous work in a variety of aspects. The 2006 version of this review included 21 studies and 2124 patients. The 2012 version of this review included 48 studies and 7776 patients. This updated review includes new data from five studies. Three of the new studies compared 5-ASA to placebo, one study compared SASP to 5-ASA and one study compared once daily 5-ASA to a conventional dosing regimen. The updated review includes 53 studies and 8548 patients which greatly increases statistical power. Whenever possible the data concerning complete remission versus improvement/remission were separated. Different quality assessment criteria (i.e. the Cochrane risk of bias tool) were used in the current and 2012 version of the review. The current and the 2012 version of the review also utilized the GRADE criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>) to assess the overall quality of the data obtained from the randomized studies included in the review.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there are some limitations to making general conclusions. Almost every study utilized a unique clinical or endoscopic index. Unlike Crohn's disease, the lack of standard indices in ulcerative colitis prevented the collection of consistent treatment efficacy data and makes comparisons across clinical studies difficult. The use of endoscopic remission as an outcome would provide a more rigorous assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials. Clinicians should use a standardized approach to assess endoscopic appearance to allow for comparisons across trials. Most of the included studies were not of sufficient duration to permit documentation of endoscopic healing. As well, results were periodically obscured in several studies that failed to specify the treatment arm to which certain excluded patients were initially randomised. Despite these and other common factors that must be considered when interpreting meta-analyses, the data provided strong evidence that pointed towards a number of conclusions.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of oral 5-ASA preparations for the treatment of mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis was confirmed. Oral 5-ASA is superior to placebo for induction of remission and clinical improvement in patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.The number needed to treat in order for one patient to benefit from treatment is nine patients. The quality of the placebo-controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the possibility of bias was rated as low for these studies. The outcomes induction of remission and clinical improvement were rated as 'high' and 'moderate' respectively using the GRADE criteria indicating that further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the point estimates of effect. In support of our previous conclusions, we observed the dose-responsiveness of 5-ASA when compared to placebo. The efficacy of oral 5-ASA increases with dose. The trend was significant in terms of global/clinical improvement (including remission), but only marginally significant when the rate of complete global/clinical remission was evaluated.</P>
<P>As was found in our previous meta-analysis, there was a non-significant trend in favour of a slight benefit for the newer 5-ASA preparations over SASP for the induction of global/clinical and endoscopic improvement (including remission). There are several points to be considered. It is possible that larger sample populations would confirm the significance of this finding, but the clinical relevance of such a difference would be debatable. Another possible explanation for the difference may be related to our use of the intention-to-treat principle which should benefit medications with lower dropout rates, in this case, 5-ASA. The quality of the SASP-controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the possibility of bias was rated as low for these studies. The outcomes induction of remission and clinical improvement were rated as 'moderate' (due to sparse data) and 'high' respectively using the GRADE criteria indicating that further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the point estimates of effect.</P>
<P>The assumption that SASP serves only as a pro-drug to deliver 5-ASA to its site of action has been questioned in light of the observation that increasing doses of 5-ASA, within the dose-response range of SASP, fail to enhance its efficacy beyond that of the standard 2 to 4 g therapeutic doses of SASP (<LINK REF="REF-Hayllar-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayllar 1991</LINK>). In active disease, a variety of 5-ASA to SASP mass ratios were studied; doses of 5-ASA corresponding to up to 10 g of SASP were commonly prescribed while just 2 to 4 g/day of SASP were used as controls. Despite this discrepancy, a significant superiority of 5-ASA could not be confirmed. Furthermore, when trial arms were subdivided according to their 5-ASA/SASP mass ratios, r (r&lt;1/2, 1/1&gt;r&gt;or=1/2, r&gt;or=1/1), no general dose trends could be detected (data not shown). It has been suggested that if an increase in the colonic concentration of 5-ASA within the range of SASP dose-dependence does not parallel an enhanced efficacy, then 5-ASA is unlikely to be the only mediator of therapeutic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Hayllar-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayllar 1991</LINK>). Elucidation of the mechanisms of action of 5-ASA, sulfapyridine, and SASP (reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Greenfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenfield 1993</LINK>), corroborated with their individual clinical effects, may explain this curious finding as well as facilitate the determination of the currently unknown etiology of ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>It was apparent that the newer 5-ASA preparations were not entirely innocent of causing adverse effects in a number of patients. However, the incidence of adverse events and withdrawals due to the 5-ASA formulations did not significantly differ from that associated with placebo. Furthermore, there were significantly more withdrawals due to adverse events with SASP than 5-ASA.</P>
<P>Olsalazine caused a significantly higher proportion of withdrawals due to adverse events relative to placebo, but lower than the proportion caused by SASP. The most common adverse event attributed to olsalazine was diarrhea, an effect previously observed to occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Ireland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ireland 1987</LINK>). It should be noted that there may have been a bias in favour of SASP since many of the studies involved patients who were known to have tolerated SASP in the past. It has been suggested that protocol alterations may reduce the withdrawal rates in future trials, since encouraging patients to take olsalazine with meals appears to reduce the incidence of diarrhea to approximately 3% of patients (Jarnerot 1996); of the included olsalazine trials, only two (<LINK REF="STD-Hetzel-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hetzel 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Zinberg 1990</LINK>) reported that patients were instructed to take their medication with meals. Mesalamine-induced interstitial nephritis is a serious but rare adverse event (<LINK REF="REF-Elseviers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elseviers 2004</LINK>). Although there have been case reports of interstitial nephritis in IBD patients treated with 5-ASA (<LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frandsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frandsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arend-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arend 2004</LINK>), there were no reports of interstitial nephritis in the studies included in this systematic review.</P>
<P>This meta-analysis indicates that oral 5-ASA administered once daily is as effective as conventional dosing (twice or three times daily) for induction therapy in mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. The pooled analyses of induction trials showed no significant differences between once daily and conventional dosing for induction of remission (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; P = 0.34) or clinical improvement (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.10; P = 0.13). Furthermore, subgroup analyses by drug formulation (MMX mesalazine, Salofalk, Asacol and Pentasa) showed no differences in efficacy between once daily and conventional dosing for induction of remission. However, the latter results should be interpreted cautiously since only four formulations were evaluated in this analysis. We believe that the methodological basis for these conclusions is relatively sound.  The quality of the trials comparing once daily to conventional dosing was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the possibility of bias was judged to be low for these studies. The overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach was rated as high for the primary outcome (clinical remission) and moderate for secondary outcomes clinical improvement and adverse events due to sparse data in the pooled analyses indicating that further research might have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. </P>
<P>Furthermore, no differences between once daily and conventionally dosed oral 5-ASA were observed for safety outcomes including the overall incidence of adverse events, withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse event or exclusions or withdrawals after entry. In keeping with the well-established safety profile of oral 5-ASA, most of the adverse events reported in the studies were mild to moderate in intensity. Common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea), headache and worsening ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>Important patient preference and adherence differences may exist between dosing regimens. In the study that measured patient preference the majority of patients preferred once daily dosing to conventional dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2009</LINK>). Although it is generally believed that administration of fewer tablets and less frequent dosing improves both efficacy and adherence, we could not demonstrate the superiority of once daily dosing for either of these outcomes. This result suggests that patient adherence does not appear to be enhanced by once daily dosing in the clinical trial setting. Several possible explanations exist for these observations, however the most plausible one concerns the unique aspects of the clinical trial environment. It is noteworthy that adherence was remarkably high in the studies that measured this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2007</LINK>). The pooled adherence rate was 92% in the once daily dosing group compared to 94% in the conventional dosing group. These rates likely reflect the highly supervised environment in which the studies were conducted.  Adherence with medication in clinical trials is generally greater than in clinical practice, since participants are highly selected volunteers who are more likely, in general, to be adherent with drug regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Andrade-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>). In addition, adherence is continuously reinforced during the clinical trial process. Thus, it may be difficult to detect differences in adherence between once daily and multiple dose regimens in this setting. Accordingly, a need exists to compare dosing regimens in large scale community-based studies.In this regard reported adherence rates in community based studies range from 40 to 60% and are especially poor among patients in remission (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shale-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shale 2003</LINK>). However, whether once daily dosing regimens improve adherence in the community remains unknown.</P>
<P>Experience from other indications suggest that factors other than the dosing regimen are  important for long-term compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Brixner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brixner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>). Long-term observations in ulcerative colitis patients as well as in other indications  indicate that  patients' and physicians' behaviors play a dominant role in adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Magowan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magowan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaulieu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaulieu 2009</LINK>). The patient-physician relationship  should reinforce adherence through education, open communication and  mutual agreement regarding the value of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy between the various formulations of oral 5-ASA. The overall pooled risk ratio (11 studies; n = 1968 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in failure to enter global or clinical remission between various formulations of 5-ASA (including Balsalazide, Pentasa, Olsalazine, MMX mesalazine; Ipocol and 5-ASA micropellets) and comparator formulations of 5-ASA (including Asacol, Claversal and Salofalk). Forty-eight per cent of patients in the 5-ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 50% of patients in the 5-ASA comparator group. The pooled risk ratio for failure to induce complete global or clinical remission for all trials was 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.19) using a fixed-effect model. The GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (failure to induce complete global or clinical remission) was moderate due to a high risk of bias (lack of blinding) in two studies in the pooled analysis (See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). However, a sensitivity analysis excluding the two high risk of bias studies (<LINK REF="STD-Farup-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Farup 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>) produced similar results (9 studies; n = 1681). Forty-eight per cent of patients in the 5-ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 50% of patients in the 5-ASA comparator group. The pooled risk ratio for failure to induce complete global or clinical remission for all trials was 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.28) using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>To further support the conclusion that there is no difference in efficacy between 5-ASA formulations, it should be noted that only one induction study (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1998</LINK>) reported a difference in efficacy between two different formulations of 5-ASA. <LINK REF="STD-Green-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1998</LINK> reported that Balsalazide 6.75 g/day was superior to Asacol 2.4 g/day for induction of complete remission (none or mild symptoms and sigmoidoscopy score of 0 or 1) at 12 weeks. However, two similar trials did not support these findings (<LINK REF="STD-Levine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pruitt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pruitt 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that systemic exposure to 5-ASA is similar for all oral 5-ASA formulations and 5-ASA prodrugs (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2003</LINK>). With the exception of olsalazine-related diarrhea (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feurle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Feurle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Zinberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 1996</LINK>), there does not appear to be any difference in safety between the various formulations of oral 5-ASA.The overall pooled relative risks showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events or exclusions or withdrawals after entry. Thus, all of the 5-ASA formulations can be considered safe and effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis, and from a practical standpoint, they can be considered therapeutically equivalent at equimolar doses (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002a</LINK>). Treatment with sulfasalazine and olsalazine may not be preferable due to the high frequency of adverse events. When selecting among the remaining 5-ASA formulations, physicians and patients should consider dose-response data for 5-ASA doses up to 4 to 4.8 g/day of 5-ASA, adherence issues related to dose forms (size of dose form and total number of tablets or capsules per day), and price, when deciding what formulations to use ( <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ASCEND I, ASCEND II and ASCEND III studies compared Asacol 4.8 g/day to Asacol 2.4 g/day in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2007</LINK>), or in patients with moderately active disease (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2009</LINK>). A pooled analysis of the three studies (n = 1459 patients) showed no statistically significant difference between the dose groups in failure to induce clinical improvement. However, subgroup analyses indicated that patients with moderate disease may benefit from the higher dose of 4.8 g/day (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2007</LINK>), particularly among patients previously treated with corticosteroids, oral 5-ASA, rectal therapies or multiple ulcerative colitis medications (<LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 2009</LINK>). Both doses appear to have similar efficacy in patients with mild disease which suggests that a dose of 2.4 g/day may be preferred for patients with mildly active disease. <LINK REF="STD-Hiwatashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hiwatashi 2011</LINK> compared Pentasa 4 g/day to Pentasa 2.25 g/day in patients with moderate disease and found a statistically significant difference in favour of the higher dose group for clinical improvement which appears to confirm the results of the ASCEND studies. <LINK REF="STD-Hiwatashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hiwatashi 2011</LINK> concluded that patients with severe symptoms such as relapse-remitting and moderately active disease should be treated initially with 4 g/day.</P>
<P>A pooled analysis of two studies (n = 194 patients) comparing MMX mesalazine 4.8 g to 2.4 g day showed no statistically significant difference between the dose groups in failure to induce clinical remission or improvement suggesting that both dosage groups are efficacious in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>). A subgroup analysis by severity did not show any advantage for the higher dose (4.8 g/day) in patients with moderate disease (<LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>). However, further research may be necessary to identify patients who will benefit from varying doses of MMX mesalamine (<LINK REF="STD-Kamm-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamm 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2003</LINK> evaluated the efficacy of three doses of Salofalk mesalamine pellets (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 g/day) in patients with active ulcerative colitis, and found no statistically significant difference in remission rates between 4.5 g/day and 3 g/day and a statistically significant difference in remission rates between 3 g and 1.5 g/day. <LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2003</LINK> concluded that there was no dose response between the three dose groups and recommended the lowest effective dose (1.5 g/day) for treatment of patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients failing this dose might benefit from an increase to 3 g/day, but doses higher than this amount do not appear to provide any additional benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>5-ASA was superior to placebo and no more effective than SASP. It is possible that special populations of patients can benefit from 5-ASA therapy. For example, the seminal fluid abnormalities associated with SASP can be reversed with the substitution of a 5-ASA preparation <I>in lieu</I> of SASP (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergaard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergaard 1989</LINK>). Nonetheless, it is clear that the newer 5-ASA preparations have yet to be proven to be more clinically beneficial than SASP for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The cost of oral 5-ASA formulations exceeds that of SASP by three to four times. The decision to use 5-ASA or SASP should consider tolerance to SASP and cost. Oral 5-ASA administered once daily is as effective and safe as conventional dosing (twice or three times daily) for induction therapy in mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. There do not appear to be any differences in efficacy or safety between the various formulations of 5-ASA. Among patients with mildly active ulcerative colitis a dosage of 4 to 4.8 g/day does not appear to provide any additional benefit over a dosage of 2 to 2.4 g/day. Patients with severe symptoms and moderately active disease may benefit from an initial dosage of 4 to 4.8 g/day. When selecting among the various 5-ASA formulations, physicians and patients should consider dose-response data, adherence issues related to dose forms (size of dose form and total number of tablets or capsules per day), and price (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002a</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-06 09:31:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Future trials comparing the efficacy of oral 5-ASA with placebo or SASP do not appear to be justified. There is little evidence to suggest that there is a difference in efficacy between the oral 5-ASA drugs. Future trials should look at enhancing patient adherence with medication. Adherence to therapy is important for treatment success and may be an important predictor of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2001</LINK>). Future trials could assess whether once daily dosing regimens improve adherence in the community. Future trials may be necessary to identify patients who will benefit from varying doses of MMX mesalamine or Salofalk.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2012-06-04 14:32:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was on an alternate basis between drug and placebo and allocated by pharmaceutical manufacturer. At initial patient interview, history and physical exam were performed including baseline laboratory studies. Urine analysis for enteric pathogens was also performed. Evaluations were performed at the end of the 2nd and 4th weeks. Endoscopic evaluation was performed at entry and after 4 weeks</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 10:32:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Male and female patients, 18 to 75 years of age, with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis - visible blood in the stool and disease involvement of 15 cm or more above the anal verge as defined by flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (N = 15). The exacerbation could be a first instance or relapse of established disease. At least 3 days prior to participation, SASP, antidiarrheal agents, antispasmodics, and anticholinergics were discontinued. Oral or rectal steroids were not permitted within 1 week of study entry and other immunosuppressants were not permitted within 1 month of study. Concomitant medications not permitted during the study included NSAIDs, salicylates, digitalis derivatives, tranquilizers, and anti-depressants</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-12 11:53:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Claire E  Parker">
<P>Olsalazine (Pharmacia) in opaque gelatin capsules, each of 250 mg (n = 7) or indistinguishable placebo capsules (n = 8) in identical containers, 12 capsules/day (3 with each meal and 3 at bedtime) for 28 days. Compliance was assessed by interview as well as by pill count</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-06-04 14:32:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Clinical evaluation included patient recordings of number of daily bowel movements, stool consistency, presence of blood and mucus, urgency, and incontinence. Endoscopic evaluation assessed the severity of ulceration, friability, erythema, and exudate, each on a 3-point scale. The sum of these three scores gave a total endoscopic score. Improvement was assessed in terms of the changes in both clinical and endoscopic evaluations</P>
