<P>Sleep problems become more common with age, affect quality of life for individuals and their families, and can increase healthcare costs. Older people are often prescribed a range of drugs for their health problems (including with sleep) many of which have side effects. This review considered the effectiveness of cognitive and behavioural treatments (CBT). These aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits and by challenging negative thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep. Reviewers report that there is only limited evidence available, and what data there is suggests a mild effect of CBT.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-12 12:39:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jo A Abbott">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders (particularly insomnia) is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods, but with no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits, promoting better sleep hygiene practices and by challenging negative thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving sleep quality, duration and efficiency amongst older adults (aged 60 and above).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 12:39:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jo A Abbott">
<P>The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002); MEDLINE (1966 - January 2002); EMBASE (1980 - January 2002), CINAHL (1982 - January 2002); PsycINFO (1887 to 2002); National Research Register (NRR) (2002, Issue 1_. Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as of all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of cognitive behavioural treatments for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Abstracts of studies identified in searches of electronic databases were read and assessed to determine whether they might meet the inclusion criteria. Data were analysed separately depending on whether results had been obtained subjectively or objectively.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials, including 282 participants with insomnia, examined the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) for sleep problems in this population. The final total of participants included in the meta-analysis was 224. The data suggest a mild effect of CBT for sleep problems in older adults, best demonstrated for sleep maintenance insomnia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>When the possible side-effects of standard treatment (hypnotics) are considered, there is an argument to be made for clinical use of cognitive-behavioural treatments. Research is needed to establish the likely predictors of success with such treatments. As it may well be the case that the treatment efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy itself is not durable, the provision of "top-up" ("refresher" sessions of CBT training to improve durability of effect are worthy of investigation.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Brabbins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabbins 1993</LINK>; National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research (<LINK REF="REF-NCSDR-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCSDR 1993</LINK>); <LINK REF="REF-Bliwise-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliwise 1993</LINK>; Foley 1995; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1989</LINK>). In the general population the most common types of sleep problems reported are insomnia (both difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep) and early morning waking with an inability to return to sleep. Older adults primarily report difficulty in maintaining sleep and, while not all sleep changes are pathological in later life (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bliwise-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliwise 1993</LINK>), severe sleep disturbances may lead to depression and cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1989</LINK>). Night waking produces significant stresses for carers and is a common cause for demands that institutional living arrangements be made (<LINK REF="REF-Pollak-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollak 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence rates of insomnia in people aged 65 and over range between 12 and 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1999b</LINK>). There are reports that the impact of chronic sleep disturbance impairs waking functions (e.g. mood, energy, performance) and life quality (<LINK REF="REF-Borkovec-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkovec 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1989</LINK>). There is evidence that sleep disturbances contribute significantly to healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Stoller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoller 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1997</LINK>). Overall, the aetiology of sleep problems in the elderly remains uncertain. There may be a developmental perspective to sleep in this population as the question of whether older adults need less sleep has not yet been answered (<LINK REF="REF-Bliwise-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliwise 1993</LINK>). Prevalence rates of insomnia are even higher when co-existing medical or psychiatric illness is taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1989</LINK>; Mellinger 1995). Lifestyle changes related to retirement, the increased incidence of health problems, and the use of medication, all place older people at increased risk of disrupted sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relationship between sleep problems and depression in the elderly is particularly strong, but difficult to disentangle. It has been reported in a large study by Ford and Kamerow that depression can predict future sleep disturbance, and that unremitting insomnia can itself cause depression (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1989</LINK>). However, amongst the eight symptoms of major depressive disorder which may predict development of the full syndrome, sleep disturbance is not the most predictive. Sleep disturbances may also be comorbid with impending dementia, but that does not mean they are the cause. Alzheimer-related deterioration of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons could cause comorbid sleep disturbance in sleep-wake cycle disorders in particular (<LINK REF="REF-Kripke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kripke 2001</LINK>). Despite the high prevalence of sleep disorders and their negative impact, it is estimated that fewer than 15% of patients with chronic insomnia receive treatment (Mellinger 1995). This may be due to a lack of knowledge about sleep and its disorders amongst health professionals. It is reported that the median amount of time spent on sleep issues in medical training in the UK is five minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Stores-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stores 1998</LINK>) and that in clinical psychology it is no better (<LINK REF="REF-Wiggs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiggs 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common treatments for sleep disorders are pharmacological, particularly for insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Hohagen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohagen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morin-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1999b</LINK>). Lack of knowledge about non-drug treatment and limited access to other forms of professional help are cited by physicians as the main reason for prescribing sleeping pills (<LINK REF="REF-Baillargeon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baillargeon 1996</LINK>); however, the long-term efficacy of this approach, which usually involves the administration of hypnotics (typically benzodiazepines) is not certain. Two consensus conferences sponsored by the National Institute of Health (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1990</LINK>) concluded that short-term use of hypnotic medications may be useful for acute and situational insomnia across all age groups, but that long-term use remains controversial because of the potential risk of tolerance and dependency. The same NIH studies indicate that the drug of choice for the symptomatic treatment of insomnia is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist (e.g. temazepam, zolpidem etc). One study by Nowell et al found that these drugs improve sleep latency (the time between going to bed and going to sleep), number of awakenings, total sleep time and total sleep quality (<LINK REF="REF-Nowell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowell 1997</LINK>). Post-treatment problems were not adequately investigated, as follow-up in this study only extended to one to two nights following discontinuation of the drug's administration. Other drugs, e.g. zaleplon, one of the most popular current benzodiazepine agonists, do not even significantly increase total sleep time. Ultimately, both consensus conferences clearly recommended against long term use of hypnotics.</P>
<P>It has been reported that older people are more likely to be affected by daytime residual effects of these types of drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prinz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prinz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kripke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kripke 2000</LINK>); that these drugs may increase the likelihood of patients developing sleep apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Kripke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kripke 1983</LINK>), as well as increasing the risk for falls and fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Wettstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wettstein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1998</LINK>). Constipation has been correlated positively with hypnotic use (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1993</LINK>). Despite this, data have suggested that persons over 60 years of age in the USA are prescribed sedative-hypnotic drugs at more than twice the rate of people 40-59 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-et-al-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum et al 1986</LINK>). Survey data suggest that older adults in France, Italy, Germany and Canada are even more likely to use hypnotics than Americans (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1999b</LINK>). The effects of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower but more durable than pharmacological methods (<LINK REF="REF-McClusky--1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClusky 1991</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Milby-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauri-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauri 1997</LINK>). In view of the potential risks of tolerance and dependency and the frequently high numbers of other drugs that older people may be taking, an evidence-based non-drug approach would be of interest.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:38:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>This is the first of four interrelated reviews investigating non-drug treatments for sleep problems in the older adult. In addition to the present review on cognitive behavioural treatments, subsequent reviews will cover physical treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2002b</LINK>), bright light therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2002a</LINK>) and hypnosis. A paper summary review will set out the evidence for the full range of non-drug treatments in an effort to answer the clinical question "What alternatives to medication exist for sleep problems in the older adult? "</P>
<P>Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by:</P>
<P>1. changing poor sleep habits<BR/>2. challenging negative thoughts attitudes and beliefs about sleep</P>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural interventions include a broad range of treatments, from educational packages to purely behavioural strategies. Those included within this review are:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sleep Hygiene Education</HEADING>
<P>Sleep hygiene education aims to teach individuals about the impact of lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise and drug use and the influence of environmental factors e.g. light, noise and temperature (<LINK REF="REF-Hauri-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauri 1991</LINK>). While these issues are unlikely to cause insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1991</LINK>) they may well exacerbate it. Studies generally advocate (1) the avoidance of caffeine and nicotine (both stimulants) in the 6 hours before bed; (2) the avoidance of alcohol around bedtime (alcohol may facilitate sleep onset but it tends to cause fragmentation of sleep and nightmares); (3) the avoidance of a heavy meal before sleep (although a light meal may be helpful); (4) the avoidance of exercise close to bed-time (even though in general exercise is helpful for sleep); and (5) the minimisation of noise, light and excessive heat during the sleep period. Sleep hygiene also includes information concerning age-appropriate sleep duration to ensure realistic expectations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stimulus Control</HEADING>
<P>Stimulus control (<LINK REF="REF-Bootzin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bootzin 1991</LINK>) involves a set of instructions aimed at helping the individual to re-associate the bed, bedtime and bedtime stimuli with sleep rather than with the frustration or anxiety resulting from lying in bed trying to sleep. Participants are instructed to (1) only go to bed when sleepy; (2) only to use the bed for sleeping and sex; (3) to leave the bed if they have not gone to sleep within 15-20 minutes and to go back only when feeling sleepy again, to be repeated as often as necessary through the night; (4) to get up at the same time each morning regardless of the amount of sleep achieved in the previous night; and (5) not to sleep during the day. "Countercontrol treatment" (<LINK REF="REF-Zwart-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwart 1979</LINK>) can be seen as a version of stimulus control. It was designed to "disrupt sleep-incompatible activities" but omitted introducing other features of classical stimulus control, e.g. leaving the bed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Muscle Relaxation Therapy</HEADING>
<P>Relaxation therapy consists of alternating tension and relaxation of various muscle groups in sequence (<LINK REF="REF-Woolfolk-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolfolk 1983</LINK>). "The Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique" as devised by Edmund Jacobson involved systematic training in tensing and relaxing groups of muscles, first separately, then with the aim of relaxing the whole body at once (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1974</LINK>). Some studies have added imagery to the relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Borkovec-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkovec 1978</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sleep Restriction Therapy</HEADING>
<P>A common treatment is sleep restriction therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Spielman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielman 1987</LINK>). This method limits the time spent in bed at night and restricts sleep during the day. Participants estimate an allowable time in bed from the diaries kept over the previous two weeks. For example if a person spends eight hours in bed and only actually sleeps for six of them, their allowed time in bed would be six hours. Weekly adjustments are made to this amount by looking at the individual's sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to time spent in bed). When sleep efficiency reaches 90%, the time allowed in bed increases by 15-20 minutes. These adjustments continue until the expected optimal amount of sleep time is reached. The urge to sleep will be increased during each stage of the treatment and in this way it is thought to increase the homeostatic drive for sleep. This type of treatment is considered likely to be effective with older people, many of whom may have tried to compensate for their poor sleep by spending more time in bed (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 1980</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-07-19 13:08:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Cognitive therapy for insomnia (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>) consists of identifying, challenging and altering a set of dysfunctional belief and attitudes about sleep and its impact on day-to-day life. It encompasses many aspects of the above treatments. The object is to break the vicious cycle of insomnia; dysfunctional cognitions and emotional distress that leads to further sleep disturbance. For example, commonly misplaced beliefs include "I cannot function unless I sleep for 8 hours per night" and "if I try harder I will eventually fall asleep".</P>

<P>In determining a cut-off point in age for this review, the age of 60 was chosen as being most clinically relevant, following consultation (<LINK REF="REF-DPOA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPOA 2000</LINK>). Trials whose focus was explicitly on the older adult were included where 80% or more of participants were recorded as being over the age of 60. Participants must have been diagnosed with sleep problems via standardised measures (e.g. the PSQI [<LINK REF="REF-PSQI-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSQI 1989</LINK>]), objective measures in sleep laboratory (e.g. polysomnography, actigraphy) or by participants' own sleep diaries or reports/diaries kept by partners or nursing staff. Participants must also have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression by the use of psychometrically sound measures such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK> ), Beck Depression Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Groth_x002d_Marnat-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groth-Marnat 1990</LINK>) or comparable instrument(s).

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:38:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Data were extracted independently by each reviewer, and compared using data extraction sheets and the "double entry" feature in RevMan 4.1. Where it was not possible to extract any data because they were not available or further information was needed, the first author of the trial was contacted for clarification. Where it was possible to extract relevant data, comments on the methods, participants, interventions and outcomes were presented in the "Included Studies" table. Individual patient data were requested from authors of all trials identified from our searches in which participants had a wide spread of ages amongst their participants and a mean age over 50 (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engle_x002d_Friedman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Engle-Friedman 1992</LINK>). The authors of the former trial have reported that lost data from their trial has recently been located and individual data from nine participants over 60 in the treatment arm and seven in the wait-list control group have been supplied and these data were then entered into the outcome (WASO, immediate post-treatment) for which they were appropriate. If the authors of the latter trial respond and it proves possible to isolate data for participants over the age of 60, such data will be entered.</P>

<P>Quality assessment was made of all included studies, to consider the following questions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was the assignment to treatment groups truly random?</LI>
<LI>Was allocation adequately concealed?</LI>
<LI>How complete was follow-up?</LI>
<LI>How were the outcomes considered for people who withdrew?</LI>
<LI>Were they included in the analysis?</LI>
<LI>Were those assessing outcomes blind to the treatment allocation?</LI>

<P>The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook criteria are based on the evidence of a strong relationship between the potential for bias in the results and allocation concealment and are defined as below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment)</P>
<P>We contacted authors of all the included studies to acquire details both of the method of randomisation and that of allocation concealment.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous (including scale) data</HEADING>
<P>Rating scales: a range of instruments are available to measure sleep quality and the aspects of mental health which are associated with it (see for example <LINK REF="REF-Hoddes-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoddes 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PSQI-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSQI 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johns-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1991</LINK>). For outcome instruments some minimum standards were required: (i) the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a book or peer-reviewed journal; (ii) the instrument should either have been: (a) a self report, or (b) a report completed by an independent rater, bed-partner or relative/carer (not the therapist); and (iii) the instrument should be either a global assessment of an area of functioning or a specific feature of sleep quality, duration or timing.</P>
<P>Combining mean treatment effects is straightforward when all measurements are comparable and on the same scale. The fixed effect estimate of the overall treatment effect can be computed as the weighted mean of the individual study effects, "...where the weights are equal to the individual study specific variance estimates. On other occasions it is necessary to transform the mean effect from each study to a standardised value by dividing by the sample standard deviation within each study. This was not necessary in the current version of this review.</P>
<P>Normal data: to avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-normally distributed data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (i) standard deviations and means had to be reported in the paper or obtained from the authors; (ii) when a scale starts from a finite number (such as 0), the standard deviation had to be less than the mean (otherwise the mean was considered unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). Data which did not meet the second standard were not entered on RevMan software (which assumes a normal distribution).</P>

<P>Specific details of each study are reported in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. The six studies included in this review were published between 1986 and 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>). Five trials were conducted in the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>) and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>). All participants were recruited from media advertisements, which suggests a highly-motivated (because self-selected) participant population. Included studies were relatively small, with a total of 282 participants, of whom 224 were used in the analysis in this review. Data from a further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Engle_x002d_Friedman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Engle-Friedman 1992</LINK>) and three unpublished dissertations (<LINK REF="STD-Espie-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Espie 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Creti 1998</LINK>) are still being sought.</P>
<P>The stated purpose of each included study was to improve sleep in the older adult with sleep problems through behavioural or cognitive techniques. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>) trialists permitted participants to remain on hypnotics during the trials, but only if the participants had stabilised on their courses of medication for at least six weeks prior to the start of the trial. Four trials positively excluded those participants who had an "inability or unwillingness to discontinue medication" (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Severity of sleep problems at baseline was measured by participants' sleep diaries (used for two weeks before the trials) in all cases (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>). Two trials also used pre-test polysomnography (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>;) to help establish baseline severity. Trialists from all studies claimed to have screened participants for dementia, depression, sleep apnoea and other potential causes of secondary insomnia, via interviews and administration of psychiatric tests, although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>) permitted one participant in its control group to remain in the trial despite being prescribed a tricyclic anti-depressant. Three trials randomised participants in severity blocks (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>). All trialists attempted to screen for comorbid conditions such as Alzheimer disease, psychoses and dementia, the effects of which have a known impact on sleep. <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK> used the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a structured clinical interview and screening tests for sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement problems (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK> excluded potential participants if they reported or were "suspected to be at risk" of sleep apnoea and emphysema and were also screened for depression using the Clinical Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) (<LINK REF="REF-Radloff-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radloff 1977</LINK>) . <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK> screened for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Groth_x002d_Marnat-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groth-Marnat 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK> used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-MMPI-1943" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMPI 1943</LINK>) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Zung-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zung 1965</LINK>), as well as personal interviews calculated to gain information on "serious, painful medical conditions (e.g. arthritis), psychopathology, sleep apnoea, or nocturnal myoclonus" (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>). Symptomatic evidence of sleep apnoea and restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movements was also sought. <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK> screened for sleep apnoea (using polysomnography ), as well as for depression, anxiety and dementia, using the MMSE, the Cornell Medical Index, the State-Trait Anxiety inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>; Spielberger 1983; <LINK REF="REF-Yesavage-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesavage 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodman 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK> screened for cognitive impairments using the MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), periodic limb movements (using polysomnography) and also reported having screened for depression, alcohol abuse and "multiple medical problems", without describing the tests used.</P>
<P>The oldest trial we included (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>) compared countercontrol behavioural therapy to wait-list control. The most recent trial included (<LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>) compared relaxation with sleep compression against a placebo described as "quasi-densensitisation". As relaxation training and sleep compression are forms of CBT, data from both groups have been pooled within the analysis. McCurry used a combination of information and sleep hygiene together with sleep compression techniques (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>). Morin and Azrin chose to compare stimulus control with imagery training against a no-treatment control group and as with Lichstein et al, data from both arms have been pooled for analysis in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>;). <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK> used a combined treatment of sleep hygiene, sleep compression, stimulus control and cognitive therapy, and compared this with a wait-list control group. <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK> compared a combination of sleep hygiene, sleep compression, stimulus control and cognitive therapy, versus temazepam, versus both the combined cognitive-behavioural treatments with temazepam, versus a placebo hypnotic (only data from the first and last arms described are used within this review, i.e. cognitive-behavioural treatments and placebo).<BR/>
<BR/>Three studies used sleep latency as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>) although data from one study were unusable as no data were reported for the control group (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>). Four studies recorded data on the amount of time participants managed to remain asleep before first waking, known as "wake after sleep onset" (WASO) (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>); one on total wake-time (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>); four on sleep duration (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>); one on early morning wakening (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>); three on sleep efficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>), one on validated scales related to sleep, i.e. the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (<LINK REF="REF-PSQI-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSQI 1989</LINK>) and the patients' and clinicians' versions of the Sleep Impairment Index (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>) although data supplied for the latter outcome were inadequate for inclusion in the analyses for this review. Various non-validated scales developed by individual trialists were reported but not included in this review's analysis. Triallists used a five-point scale for "previous night's sleep quality" and a five-point scale for "how I felt upon awakening" (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>), a five-point scale for "patient's outcomes ratings", including "severity, interference and noticeability" of sleeping problems (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>), a five-point scale for the views of "significant others" on participants' sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>) and a five-point rating scale measuring "perceived quality of sleep" (<LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK> included a "treatment reliability measure" which was constituted of anonymous ratings by treated participants of expectancies for success, treatment plausibility and confidence in recommending treatment to an insomniac friend; similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK> assessed "treatment credibility" including dimensions such as "reasonableness of treatment, opinion of the therapist and willingness [of participant] to recommend treatment to a friend".</P>
<P>Follow-up data were sought after four weeks in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>) (though data has not been presented in published or unpublished form); after three months in four of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK> ), after one year in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK>) and after two years in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Morin-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Morin 1999a</LINK>).

Total wake-time was measured at all of the three outcome periods (immediate post-treatment, three-month, and one year+). The overall effect immediately post-treatment was encouraging as measured by sleep diaries, with participants in the control group spending an hour less awake during the night than control (decrease of 62.22 minutes, (95% CI = -107.94, -16.50; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), but the very wide confidence intervals mean this should be interpreted cautiously.

For this outcome, only data from one of the two treatment arms involved in <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK> has been used. This is because relaxation techniques (in the first arm) were used to increase total sleep time, while the second arm (sleep compression) involves a paradoxical technique in which participants' time in bed is limited. Thus a lower N is shown for <LINK REF="STD-Lichstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lichstein 2001</LINK> for all data measurement points.</P>
<P>The overall effect immediately post-treatment was mild when measured by sleep diaries, with participants in the treatment group having 14.6 minutes more sleep a night than control (95% CI = -36.13, -7.01; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). When measured by PSG, this effect was not supported with overall effect reversing to favour control (participants in the control group slept 19 minutes more a night than treatment group, 95% CI = -38.96, 68.5; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). It should be noted that PSG was conducted at post-treatment in only two of the four studies which measured sleep duration.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Overall, the results of this review suggest that cognitive-behavioural treatments for sleep problems in people aged 60 and over are mildly effective for some aspects of sleep according to the patient diaries in the short term, but that the effect of these treatments is not always durable. However, in general, beneficial effects are not as great as for these treatments when used with younger adults (see <LINK REF="REF-Pallesen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallesen 1998</LINK> for a review making this comparison) which is consistent with other research into the efficacy of CBT with older adults. The objective reports of sleep by polysomnography do not always agree with the patient reports, which was particularly notable in the data for sleep duration. It should be recognised that there is a large variation in the interpretation of many sleep variables (<LINK REF="REF-McGhie-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGhie 1962</LINK>) and so, both objective and subjective measures have been included in this review.</P>
<P>The results of this review of the effects of cognitive-behavioural treatments on sleep are mixed. Total sleep duration appears to show a modest improvement at post-treatment, which declines with time. Night waking (WASO) shows clinically important improvements, although these appear to diminish somewhat over time. Sleep onset latency (SOL, or "settling") seems to change very little as a result of the interventions investigated, while early morning waking reduces slightly. Results for sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed in which participants are actually asleep) suggests a modest gain initially, which erodes over time.</P>
<P>Participant reports of total sleep duration are not supported by polysomnography (PSG); in contrast, the substantial improvements reported by participants for night waking (WASO) are objectively supported. Neither sleep onset latency, early morning waking nor sleep efficiency have objective confirmation of participant reports.</P>
<P>Results from the one trial which used the Pittsburgh Index of Sleep Quality suggested that all participants in the trial remained at pathological levels of sleep disturbance throughout the trial (a finding which may at least partially be explained by the fact that all were full-time partners or carers of people with Alzheimers' disease). Nevertheless, whilst participants from the treatment group improved their scores from baseline to follow-up (10.8 down to 6.20), the control group over the same time period improved only from 11.9 to 10.2.</P>

<P>While some of the improvements reported here appear modest, they might well be considered clinically useful and patient reports indicate that they are both worthwhile and valued, particularly when compared with drug-induced sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Giblin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Giblin 1983</LINK>). Some studies have reported considerable reductions in hypnotic usage following CBT for sleep problems and in a population whose usage of drugs is generally high this may be particularly important. A prospective study examining 5-year mortality among hypnotic drug users and respondents with subjective insomnia identified in a longitudinal study of health, activity, and lifestyle (Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing) which involved 1042 survey respondents, aged over 65 years, concluded that the mortality rate of participants was significantly greater among those taking some form of medication for sleep than for those not taking sleep medication (<LINK REF="REF-Rumble-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumble 1992</LINK>). Generally, research supports the idea that when informed of options for the treatment of chronic insomnia, CBT treatments are welcomed (see <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2001</LINK>, wherein the concept of treatment preference and patient satisfaction is investigated). Researchers reported that cognitive-behavioural therapy was "significantly preferred over pharmacological therapy at pre-treatment ...." The study further reported that, amongst the treatment techniques used, participants "least liked sleep restriction and most liked sleep hygiene." Use of the model for PPA (prospective preference assessment) described by Halpern might also enhance participant satisfaction and adherence to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Homogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Specific cognitive-behavioural interventions and the mode and quality of therapist delivery vary somewhat. It may be that these differences can explain some of the heterogeneity in these results. Moreover, research has suggested that the efficacy of CBT declines with age (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCurry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McCurry 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Morin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1994</LINK> also reported that sleep restriction (reducing time in bed to as near as possible to time asleep) resulted in a worsening of sleep duration at least in the short-term, or alternatively that sleep efficiency had improved (the ratio of time asleep to time in bed) at the expense of sleep duration. It should also be considered that there may be a developmental perspective to sleep in this population as the question of whether older adults need less sleep or cannot get more sleep has not yet been answered (<LINK REF="REF-Bliwise-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliwise 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>There is considerable overlap between many cognitive behavioural interventions such as aspects of sleep hygiene which may restrict sleep. It is therefore not possible to determine which parts of these therapies are effective. Studies did not refer to standard AASM criteria for diagnosing patients sleep problems which may limit the internal reliability of this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 1990</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-19 14:26:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>All treatment gains reported in this review are modest when compared with those reported by others (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pallesen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallesen 1998</LINK>). This can be explained partly by the rigorous inclusion criteria applied within this review; for example, our requirements that 80% of the sample be over the age of 60; that dropout be less &lt;30%; that clear measures of the sleep problem at baseline be present and that screening for psychiatric co-morbidities by standardised measures take place. Excluded studies almost invariably reported more significant treatment gains (see "<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>"). The lack of effect at follow-up in this review (even for those sleep variables for which CBT did appear modestly effective) also contrasts with the findings of other reviews, possibly for the same reasons. It may be that using written materials or videotapes would help patients maintain or enhance the changes they had achieved as shown in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>) in children (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2001</LINK>) and more specifically in adult insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Mimeault-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mimeault 1999</LINK>- see below, and <LINK REF="STD-Giblin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Giblin 1983</LINK>). Research into the effectiveness of "booster sessions" for maintaining the benefits of a cognitive-behavioural programme for insomnia for adults aged 20 - 75 reported no difference at follow-up between groups which received post-treatment "booster sessions" and those which did not (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1986</LINK>). However, it is highly likely that Cook's timing (a mere two months' after cessation of the CBT treatment programme) as well as the fact that both groups were still showing significant improvement in their sleep problems, suggests that "booster sessions" were not yet required. Further testing is needed to show whether or not "booster sessions" at six months or a year from initial treatment (when, as this review shows, benefit has markedly declined) might maintain earlier improvements.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The data suggest a mild effect of CBT for different aspects of the sleep problems in older adults. The small number of studies meeting the stringent criteria for inclusion in this review may also influence the apparent efficacy. It is notable that a large number of excluded studies reported positive results and that the main reason for their exclusion was that their mean age was younger than 60. While it may well be the case that the treatment efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions seems to decline with the age of participants, they may still be worthy of consideration by clinicians, especially in a population for whom alternative treatments may be limited. As some studies have reported that older adults are more likely to be taking a wide range of medications for other health problems and that many hypnotics have side-effects, it is likely that reducing additional medication for sleep problems would be a positive benefit to the health of older adults. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia has several related dimensions, as has been discussed in this review. It might be the case that some aspects of it are of greater importance than others and that research into the 'active ingredient(s)' would be useful in refining the treatment. In addition, cognitive-behavioural treatments involve a considerable commitment on the parts of both the patient and therapist since the apparent paradoxical intervention (especially in sleep restriction) can make compliance difficult to achieve. Research is needed to establish the likely predictors of success with these treatments. In view of the high prevalence of sleep problems and the common co-morbidity of them with other disorders, notably anxiety and depression, particular attention must be paid to these conditions as potential confounders in the older adult population. </P>
<P>Where such interventions are reported to have an effect, durability must be considered. To increase durability of effect the provision of either "top-up" sessions of CBT training at intervals of 6-12 months following initial treatment and/or the provision of written materials and/or videocassettes for home use following treatment should be tested. Cost-benefit analysis as regards these treatments versus pharmacological treatments would be a particularly useful addition to this area of study. </P>
<P>Finally, the role of cognitive-behavioural therapy in preventative education for sleep disorders may also be worthy of investigation. Given that the efficacy of CBT is known to reduce with age, it may be that sound prevention programmes delivered in "the middle years" might benefit adults as they age and become more prone to sleep problems.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Alperson-1979">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This trial of relaxation and stimulus control is only a randomised controlled trial for participants under 55. Participants under 55 were randomised to different treatments and a control group but all participants over 55 were given the same treatment. The main findings did show that sleep onset latency fell by an average of 25%, although older participants improved less than younger ones.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Anderson-1988">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study (comparing stimulus control and sleep restriction to control) was not randomised. Main findings did suggest that active treatment improved WASO by 106 minutes and sleep efficiency by 21%.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Friedman-1991">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This study comparing sleep restriction and relaxation was not truly randomised (alternate allocation was used). Furthermore, there was no control group. The study suggested sleep restriction therapy was superior to relaxation<BR/>in terms of total sleep time but latency and WASO were improved in both treatments.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Giblin-1983">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This RCT comparing autogenic relaxation techniques with a control group failed to screen participants for potentially confounding co-morbid conditions, e.g. depression or dementia. Main findings were positive at three-month follow-up, initial findings less so (probably because all participants had been on hypnotics until just before the beginning of the trial).</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Hoch-2001">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This RCT evaluating sleep restriction and sleep hygiene sought to protect sleep quality in normal participants (aged 70-90) who had reported no symptoms of sleep problems. Furthermore, control group was "archival."</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Puder-1983">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Of 25 participants assigned to treatment in this RCT of short-term stimulus control, only 16 completed the treatment (attrition rate = 36%, 6% higher than maximum allowed by inclusion criteria of this review). Main findings included statistically significant improvement in sleep onset latency.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Riedel-1995">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This RCT relied upon self-report of insomnia for participant inclusion. Neither objective measures nor sleep diaries were used.</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Schnelle-1999">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This RCT includes participants whose sleep is described as "fragmented" largely as a result of their incontinence care routines. As baseline sleep duration is over 11 hours on average, however, they were not considered to have a primary sleep problem.</P>
