<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-13 08:34:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence regarding the use of insulin and oral agents for managing cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting genetic disease in white populations; it damages the lungs and pancreas. The pancreas makes insulin, which is a hormone needed by the body to take sugar into the cells (like those in the liver, muscle and fat) and convert it into energy. People with cystic fibrosis need high-calorie diets to maintain enough muscles to make up for breathing difficulties resulting from lung damage. It is therefore important for people, who have diabetes as an additional complication to their cystic fibrosis, to turn sugar into energy efficiently, so that they can manage their breathing difficulties and maintain an ideal body weight. The inflammatory processes in cystic fibrosis can firstly reduce insulin production and then lessen its effect by causing insulin resistance. An increased in life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis means the likelihood of developing cystic fibrosis related diabetes is now at 50%. We therefore wanted to assess different treatments to minimize a decline in health. These treatments include artificial sources of insulin (like long-acting glargine or short-acting protamine insulin) and medications that enhance a person&#8217;s own insulin release or which affect insulin resistance (specifically as this relates to inflammation seen in this disease process).</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 18 February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included four randomized trials with a total of 200 participants. The trials' duration ranged from single doses to 24 months of treatment. Three trials compared insulin (given via a syringe) to repaglinide tablets and recruited 180 people between them. Trial participants had an average age of 25 years and mild to severe diabetes. One of these trials (73 people) compared the two treatment groups directly over a two-year period; the remaining two trials each had a third treatment arm - one (seven people) compared single doses of insulin to repaglinide and to no treatment and the other (100 people) compared insulin to repaglinide and to a placebo (a dummy tablet with no active medication) for 12 months. The fourth trial recruited 20 participants with an average age of 34 years and compared the long-acting insulin glargine to short-term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin over a 12-week period.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We were not able to show that any of the treatments were better than the others. Only a few cases of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) were seen in three out of the four trials (none in the longest trial), but these events resolved without further treatment. Longer-term studies are still needed to see how controlling cystic fibrosis-related diabetes affects lung function. There also needs to be research into the use of agents used together with insulin to enhance its action, especially those agents with additional anti-inflammatory potential.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The participants would have been mostly able to tell which treatment they were receiving (e.g. insulin via a syringe or repaglinide as a tablet), so we thought there was a high risk from blinding in all trials (except when comparing repaglinide tablets to placebo (dummy) tablets). In two trials we are satisfied that participants were put into the different treatment groups completely at random; however, the other two trial reports were not clear on how it was decided which group the participants were put into. In only one trial was it clear that no one knew in advance which group a participant would be put into, in the other three trials there were no details given. There could be some bias if it was known in advance which group the next participant would be in, e.g. healthier participants might be put into one group to show better results for that treatment. There were also many results which were not fully reported in the publications. Finally, there may be bias in the results as the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given were not comparable.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-13 08:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends both short-term and long-acting insulin therapy when cystic fibrosis-related diabetes has been diagnosed. Diagnosis is based on: an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 6.94 mmol/liter (125 mg/deciliter); or oral glucose tolerance tests greater than 11.11 mmol/liter (200 mg/deciliter) at two hours; or symptomatic diabetes for random glucose levels greater than 11.11 mmol/liter (200 mg/deciliter); or glycated hemoglobin levels of at least 6.5%.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-06 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-18 15:06:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also handsearched abstracts from pulmonary symposia and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conferences.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 18 February 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-07 14:17:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing all methods of diabetes therapy in people with diagnosed cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:40:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-13 08:31:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The searches identified 22 trials (34 references). Four trials (200 participants) are included: one short-term single-center trial (n = 7) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and no medication in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and normal fasting glucose; one long-term multicenter trial (n = 100, 74 of whom had cystic fibrosis-related diabetes) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and placebo; one long-term multicenter trial (n = 73) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide; and one 12-week single-center trial (n = 20) comparing the long-acting insulin glargine to short-term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin.</P>
<P>Two trials with data for the comparison of insulin to placebo did not report any significant differences between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels, lung function and nutritional status. This was also true for the single trial with data for the comparison of repaglinide to placebo. Two trials (one lasting one year and one lasting two years) contributed data for the comparison of insulin versus repaglinide. There were no significant differences for the primary outcomes at any time point, except at one year (in the two-year trial) when the insulin group had significant improvement in z score for body mass index compared to the repaglinide group. The single trial comparing glargine to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin also did not report any significant differences in the review's primary outcomes. A few cases of hypoglycemia were seen in three out of the four trials (none in the longest trial), but these events resolved without further treatment.</P>
<P>There was an unclear risk of bias from randomization and allocation concealment in two of the four included trials as the authors did not report any details; in the remaining two studies details for randomization led to a low risk of bias, but only one had sufficient details on allocation concealment to allow a low risk judgement, the second was unclear. There was a high risk from blinding for all trials (except for the comparison of oral repaglinide versus placebo) due to the nature of the interventions. Complete data for all outcomes were not available from any trial leading to a high risk of reporting bias. The amounts of insulin and repaglinide administered were not comparable and this may lead to bias in the results. None of the included trials were powered to show a significant improvement in lung function.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-23 08:52:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This review has not found any significant conclusive evidence that long-acting insulins, short-acting insulins or oral hypoglycemic agents have a distinct advantage over one another in controlling hyperglycemia or clinical outcomes associated with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. While some cystic fibrosis centers use oral medications to help control diabetes, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (USA) clinical practice guidelines support the use of insulin therapy and this remains the most widely-used treatment method. Randomized controlled trials specifically related to controlling diabetes with this impact on the course of pulmonary disease process in cystic fibrosis continue to be a high priority.</P>
<P>There is no demonstrated advantage yet established for using oral hypoglycemic agents over insulin, and further trials need to be evaluated to establish whether there is clear benefit for using hypoglycemic agents. Agents that potentiate insulin action, especially agents with additional anti-inflammatory potential should be further investigated to see if there may be a clinical advantage to adding these medications to insulin as adjuvant therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-02 09:29:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:21:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Survival of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) now extends well into adulthood, and as a consequence secondary disease processes are increasingly being recognized. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) represents the highest secondary prevalence in cystic fibrosis (CF) and is seen in nearly 20% of adolescents and 40% to 50% of adults with CF (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). The diagnosis of CFRD is currently made during a period of stable baseline health according to standard American Diabetic Association (ADA) criteria. This diagnosis is therefore made if the two-hour oral glucose tolerance plasma glucose is elevated (greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l)); there is a fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126; A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%; or if polyuria or polydipsia are in the presence of a casual glucose level of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl. The diagnosis of CFRD can additionally be considered in pwCF with acute illness when they maintain fasting plasma glucose elevations, or two-hour post-prandial plasma glucose levels greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl for more than 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>). There is a 36% occurrence of microvascular complications that includes kidney disease and retinopathy in CFRD, compared to 18% in the non-CF diabetic population (<LINK REF="REF-Landers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarzenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzenberg 2007</LINK>). Microvascular complications result from prolonged periods of hyperglycemia which inflict pathological changes within small blood vessels. These factors may impact on a reported 60% survival to age 30 years for pwCF but without diabetes, compared to 25% for pwCF and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelstein 1988</LINK>). The negative impact of diabetes has been more specifically linked to rapid decline in pulmonary function and body mass index (BMI) in pwCF (<LINK REF="REF-Lanng-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanng 1994</LINK>), and most recently, a link to the quality of diabetes management has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>). These findings have important implications, as end-stage lung disease is the ultimate event leading to mortality in nearly all pwCF, and the added complication of diabetes may hasten this process, as well as the additional impacts on secondary disease processes as a consequence of improved survival of pwCF.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-14 14:13:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines recommend insulin as the treatment of choice, based on evidence supported by observation of increasing trends toward insulin deficiency over time (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>); however, insulin deficiency is seldom absolute, as ketoacidosis is a very uncommon complication in CF. Increasing insulin resistance has further been correlated to the progressive development of impaired glucose tolerance seen in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Hardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardin 1997</LINK>). The implication of both a relative decrease in pancreatic insulin release, and an increase in insulin resistance to glucose metabolism by the body suggests potential roles for both oral insulin-releasing hypoglycemic and oral insulin-sensitizing medications in the management of CFRD insulin therapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:14:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Therapeutic reports for CFRD which have discussed the impact on pulmonary function and body weight (as a proportion to the square of the height known as the BMI) have been limited to individuals managed by insulin therapy. The institution of insulin therapy aimed toward optimizing glycemic control to the range recommended by the ADA (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>) has been recently demonstrated to have a positive impact toward improving glycemic control based on HbA1c measurements and to minimize long-term micro-vascular disease based on correlations from a recent prognostic cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzenberg 2007</LINK>). The effect of maintaining HbA1c at or below 7% in CFRD is now significantly associated with minimizing the complications of diabetes on microvascular disease at a prevalence even more reduced than is seen for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-02 09:29:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Reports of the use of oral hypoglycemic agents for controlling HbA1c are limited. There is only one case-based published study reporting the effects of insulin-sensitizing agents (<LINK REF="STD-Onady-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Onady 2006</LINK>). Recommendations for glycemic control by the ADA emphasize the importance of optimizing the secondary prevention of the complication of microvascular disease in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but there is still uncertainty as to how this control impacts on microvascular disease in CFRD, pulmonary function or optimal weight through improved carbohydrate metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>This version of the review is an update of previous versions (<LINK REF="REF-Onady-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onady-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onady 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>We aimed to compare different insulin regimens and regimens of oral diabetic medications to each other.

However, we did identify such studies and included them and note this <I>post hoc </I>change was made to the review. We planned to include studies where insulin regimens plus either an oral medication or placebo are compared. In this analysis we aimed to consider studies comparing different classes of these therapeutic agents, as well as assessing strategies to reduce side effects and harm in using these agents.</P>

<P>Relevant trials were sought from the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register using the terms: insulin OR diabetes.</P>
<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology</I> and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant sections of the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/CF/frame.html">Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module</A>.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:24:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Each author independently extracted data using standard data acquisition forms; however, the authors judged the data from one of the included cross-over trials to have been more appropriately analysed in the original paper and since they were not able to obtain first-arm data from the trial investigators, they have reported results narratively directly from the publication (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). If it is necessary for future updates of the review, the review authors will request individual or additional summary data from the trial authors.</P>
<P>We planned to measure outcome data at 1, 3, 6, 12 months and annually thereafter. We were able to report data for glucose levels, weight, fat mass and lean mass and hypoglycemic events at three months and for BMI, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC at 12 months. If for future updates, if trial investigators report any other time points relevant and applied toward the primary and secondary outcomes, then we will give consideration to these too.</P>
<P>For any data presented as means and standard errors in the cross-over trial by Grover and the parallel trial by Moran (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>), we converted the standard errors (SEs) to standard deviations (SDs) to allow data to be entered in the analysis.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:24:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In order to establish a risk of bias for the included trial, for the original review each author assessed the methodological quality of the trial. In future, authors will also monitor the consistency of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the appropriateness of comparisons and the rate of attrition.</P>
<P>For the updates from 2013 onwards, the authors assessed the risk of bias of the included trials according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These methods examine internal validity by addressing selection, performance and attrition bias. Authors also assessed concealment of treatment allocation using this methodology. Authors prioritized external validity to assure the availability of adequate information regarding the characteristics of participants and their results in the included trials. Authors also compared the outcomes listed in the methods section of the trial publication to the results reported to assess for selective outcome reporting. For each included trial, the authors gave a judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias for each of the criteria examined.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:24:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In future updates of this review, for binary outcomes the goal will be to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect for each outcome across trials using the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, the authors measured the mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or post-intervention values and SD for each group. Where it was necessary, we calculated the SD from the SE which was presented in the trial publication. The authors used a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-04-01 15:25:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cross-over trials may be relevant when both insulin and oral agents are involved and indeed two of the included trials were of cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). The authors treated the data from the Grover trial as if it had been a parallel trial since the first-arm trial data were not available as confirmed by the trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). No first-arm data were available for analysis from the Moran trial despite the review authors contacting the trial authors for more information, and on previous advice from a statistician the results from this trial, which were analysed more appropriately in the original trial publication, are reported in the review narratively (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). The authors did not combine data from the cross-over trial with those from the parallel trial. If, in the future, the authors include further cross-over trials, they will decide whether to report these results narratively also, or they may decide to analyse the cross-over trials as if they had been parallel trials (assuming a correlation of zero as the most conservative estimate). Elbourne says that this approach produces conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Also each participant appears in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups are not independent (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-01-06 11:32:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For this version of the review, the authors have presented the data which are reported in the trial publications. They tried to obtain first-arm data from the authors of the 2001 Moran trial and from the Grover trial, but the investigators informed the authors that it was not possible to provide these data as they were no longer available (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). In future updates of this review, the authors will seek data on the number of participants with each outcome measure by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance or otherwise excluded from treatment at follow up. If these data are not available in publications, the authors will make every attempt to contact the trial investigators for further information.</P>

This measure describes the percentage of total variation across trials that are due to heterogeneity rather than by chance. The values of I<SUP>2</SUP> lie between 0% and 100%, and a simplified categorization of heterogeneity that we plan to use is of low (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 25%), moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 50%), and high (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 75%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

Both cross-over trials included a washout period. One of these trials utilized three separate single doses over a one-month to two-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). The remaining cross-over trial used a one-month washout period (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). Duration of the trials ranged from a single-dose trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>) to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The four included trials employed different interventions.</P>
<P>Three compared insulin with oral repaglinide (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). Ballmann compared insulin with doses starting at 0.05 units/kg body weight and then adjusted to maintain a postprandial glucose over 160 mg/dl to oral repaglinide with doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 2 mg and again adjusted to keep postprandial glucose at over 160 mg/dl (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>). One of the Moran trials had a third 'no medication' arm (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>), while the second trial by Moran included a third placebo arm (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). The earlier trial considered single-dose treatments given in random order of no medication versus insulin (0.1 unit/kg) versus repaglinide (1 mg); both insulin and repaglinide were administered 10 minutes prior to a meal (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>). This trial was mostly used to develop more a clinically relevant trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). The second trial compared insulin (0.5 unit insulin aspart/15 g dietary carbohydrate) to repaglinide (2 mg) three times daily before meals (time frame not stated) (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>).

<P>The fourth trial compared neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin to glargine; both treatments were administered once daily at bedtime (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>).

The Grover article states that this was a cross-over trial, so that once randomized to start either therapy (bedtime NPH-Aspart OR bedtime glargine) the participant (and physician) would be aware of the treatment given due to the frequency of dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). The earlier Moran paper does not discuss blinding of participants, clinicians or outcome assessors, however, as the interventions were either no medication, insulin via a syringe or oral repaglinide it would have been impossible to blind the participants or the clinicians to the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the later Moran trial, participants were blinded when receiving either the oral agent or the oral placebo, which leads to a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). However, it should be noted that it was not possible to blind participants receiving insulin, so this arm of the trial is at risk of bias from blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>).</P>

The publications relating to the Ballmann trial did not report any dropouts; however, we judged this trial to have an unclear risk of bias as relevant information is not clearly reported in the abstracted data released for this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>). The Grover trial reported that one male participant dropped out of the group who received NPH first, however, no reason was given for this and it was also not stated in which arm of the trial the dropout occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We judged the Ballmann trial to have an unclear risk of bias due to industry sponsorship. While this trial was sponsored by Novo Nordisc, they were only one of three sponsors or collaborators and it is not clear how much influence they had over the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged three included trials to be at high risk from other potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Grover trial, diabetic participants with normal fasting blood sugars were excluded from the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). The Grover trial was of cross-over design, but we analysed the data as if the trial was of parallel design since first-arm data were not available. This approach produces conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Also each participant appears in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups are not independent (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>); hence there is an additional risk of bias to the results.</P>
<P>In the 2001 Moran trial, the insulin doses were chosen at a pharmacological optimal dose range (0.1 unit/kg/body weight); while repaglinide dosing at 1 mg only represents 25% of the recommended maximal dose (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the later Moran trial, diabetic participants with fasting hyperglycemia were excluded from the trial. Furthermore, after the trial was started four repaglinide participants (17%) had doses of medication reduced compared to only two insulin-only participants, which could explain the reason the repaglinide lost statistical significance after the first six months of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>).</P>

One of these was a short-term randomized controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>), which has evolved into a multicenter RCT comparing insulin to repaglinide and placebo over a 12-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). This later trial identified a slightly more favorable response to insulin and when factoring in the 12-month pre-treatment run-in period the results demonstrated a significant advantage. There were clear differences in the slope of BMI change between the insulin and repaglinide groups during this run-in period. In this review, when factoring out the run-in period which was presented in the original paper, the significance of results vanished and there are no differences between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). In the more recent and longer-term trial, the only initial significant advantage of improved body mass index (BMI) z score at 12 months, was lost at the two-year time-point (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fourth included trial compared NPH insulin and glargine over a three-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). The only clear conclusion from this comparison that can made at this time, is that while fasting glucose may be diminished by 2 mg/dl for the long-acting insulin glargine, there is no significant therapeutic advantage in treating people with CFRD and fasting hyperglycemia with glargine insulin compared to protamine Hagedorn insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>At this point, no conclusions can be made as to the optimal therapy for people with CFRD with normal fasting hyperglycemia; despite recommendations in the current version of the CFRD Clinical Practice Guidelines to treat this subgroup of people with CFRD only at meal times with a short-acting insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-04 10:52:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The participant numbers in the trials included in this review were quite small, and the trials were not powered for important clinical outcomes such as forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). In the only trial where powering was adequate for comparisons of BMI, lead-in bias places some concern as to the validity of the reported outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). We had hoped to be able to pool data so as to improve on the quality of the currently available evidence, unfortunately there were too many differences between the trials included in the review to allow this, except for one lung function outcome at the 12-month time-point (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-09 11:41:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Some CF centers use oral medications to help control diabetes, yet insulin remains the accepted as the treatment or intervention of choice as reported in the CFRD Clinical Practice Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>) and as evident from the interventions investigated in the limited number of trials that have been evaluated for this review. A cohort study has demonstrated the use of insulin in maintaining a HbA1c below 7% and also a significant reduction in microvascular disease for CFRD (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzenberg 2007</LINK>); however, trials have yet to significantly demonstrate the long-term impact of insulin therapy on lung function. Outcomes reported in the trials included in this review did not demonstrate a significant impact on lung function between the insulins or oral agents identified from the trials.</P>
<P>The two Moran trials only investigated a subgroup of people with CFRD with normal fasting glucose values (<LINK REF="STD-Moran-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moran 2009</LINK>). Other non-randomized clinical trials of oral hypoglycemic agents have similarly found that these drugs usually only demonstrate a clinical advantage in this subgroup of people with CF for about the first six months of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Culler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenecker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenecker 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-09 11:42:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There is currently no significant conclusive evidence that long-acting insulins, short-acting insulins or oral hypoglycemic agents have a distinct advantage over one another in controlling hyperglycemia or clinical outcomes associated with CFRD. A single-center long-term prospective prognostic cohort trial is currently the best evidence available to date that demonstrates that insulin therapy for both normal and elevated fasting hypoglycemia improves the control of micro-vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzenberg 2007</LINK>). Outside of this singularly important clinical outcome, the impact on clinical outcomes important to people with CF, namely long-term BMI and pulmonary function measures, have yet to be conclusively demonstrated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-09 11:44:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Multicenter RCTs are still required in order to best assess the effectiveness of therapeutic options in the control of CFRD. This Cochrane review suggests the potential for achieving tighter glycemic control with long-acting insulin for people with CF with fasting hyperglycemia and this could likely be demonstrated in future studies with the use of insulin infusion pumps. The use of therapeutic agents which may provide additional impact in CF based on the inflammatory effects of insulin sensitivity and the control of levels of inflammatory mediators by mechanisms such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) receptor agonists still remains to be demonstrated. The concerns with this class of agents are the side effects associated with the glitazones. Cardiac effects associated with the glitazones are less applicable to people with CF, with such a low incidence of coronary artery disease; and osteoporosis concerns may be less problematic in CF due to interleukin inhibitory effect of PPARg agonists on IL-6. Finally, the potential value of metformin in people with CF without hepatic dysfunction demonstrates another potential option in treating CFRD. These additional agents may provide a unique advantage, perhaps as adjuvant therapy to insulin, for a population that is highly adversely impacted by inflammatory disease.</P>
<P>Outcomes of greatest interest in future trials comparing long-acting versus short-acting insulins, or insulins to oral agents should be powered such that they can include BMI, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, performance on the six-minute walk test, frequency of hospital admissions and effects on bone metabolism. Furthermore, epidemiology demonstrates increased morbidity and mortality for people with CF with glucose intolerance, which prompts RCTs to examine the use of long-acting insulin in the management of pre-diabetics who are screened as glucose intolerant verses conservative observation.</P>

<P>Diabetic patients with normal fasting blood sugars were excluded from the trial. </P>
<P>This trial was of cross-over design but we analysed the data as if the trial was of parallel design since first-arm data were not available. This approach produces conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Also each participant appears in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups are not independent.</P>

<P>There is potential bias as to optimization of dosing of agents used in this trial. Insulin doses were chosen at a pharmacological optimal dose range (0.1 unit/kg/body weight); while repaglinide dosing at 1 mg only represents 25% of the recommended maximal dose. Otherwise, control of pre-trial meals, interventions and measurements were identical in each phase of the trial, with the participants serving as their own controls.</P>
