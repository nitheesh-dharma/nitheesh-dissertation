<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-10 08:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia due to Alzheimer&#8217;s and vascular disease is an enormous public health problem. Currently, an estimated 36 million people worldwide live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective interventions to reduce the burden of disease are urgently needed. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are non-pharmacological methods that aim to help people with early-stage dementia make the most of their memory and cognitive functioning despite the difficulties they are experiencing. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or problem-solving. Cognitive rehabilitation focuses on identifying and addressing individual needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids.</P>
<P>This review included 11 trials of cognitive training and a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation. We found no evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive functioning, mood or activities of daily living in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia; however the quality of the studies was generally not high. The single trial of cognitive rehabilitation provided preliminary indications of the potential benefits of individual cognitive rehabilitation in improving activities of daily living in people with mild Alzheimer's disease. More high-quality trials of both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are needed to establish their efficacy for people with early-stage dementia.</P>

<P>The main aim of the current review was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in relation to important cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver in the short, medium and long term.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions, and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the family caregiver, were considered for inclusion.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-10 08:16:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta-analysis could be conducted for 11 of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta-analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed-effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta-analysis could be conducted.</P>

<P>Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-09 12:04:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further, well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. Researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-14 13:41:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognitive impairment is a defining feature of dementia caused by neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease. In the milder stages of dementia, cognitive impairments are often the most disabling and distressing features for the individual and for the family. For the person with dementia, memory and other cognitive difficulties can have a major impact on self-confidence and can lead to anxiety, depression and withdrawal from activities, which in turn can make the difficulties seem worse. This is an example of what has been termed 'excess disability' (<LINK REF="REF-Reifler-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reifler 1990</LINK>). Family caregivers are also affected by the practical impact of cognitive problems on everyday life and by the strain and frustration that can result. Interventions designed to assist with aspects of cognitive functioning such as memory problems are therefore important in the milder stages of dementia, as they may allow the person greater independence and can potentially minimise the risk of excess disability. The current review is an update of previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2008</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-14 10:34:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>AD and cerebrovascular disease are the most common aetiologies underlying dementia among older individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Alzheimer_x0027_s-Disease-International-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alzheimer's Disease International 2009</LINK>). Dementia due to AD is generally characterised by an insidious onset; vascular dementia is often associated with a more rapid onset. However, both disorders have a progressive course that eventually culminates in global cognitive impairment and compromised functional independence. During milder stages, clinical signs typically include forgetfulness for recent events and other cognitive impairments such as word-finding difficulties or increased confusion in navigating unfamiliar environments. These signs often precede the formal diagnosis by several years, but they can be difficult to distinguish from the common forgetfulness associated with normal ageing&#8212;a factor that often leads to delays in bringing the situation to medical attention. During this pre-dementia phase, there is often no, or minimal, impairment in the ability of the individual to carry out most activities of daily living. With disease progression, difficulties develop in most other cognitive domains, such as semantics, praxis and executive functioning. Functional impairment also becomes increasingly evident. In more advanced dementia, most cognitive and functional abilities are profoundly impaired, and behavioural changes such as apathy, depression, aggression and agitation are frequently observed (<LINK REF="REF-Lyketsos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyketsos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortby-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortby 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>On neuropsychological examination, the earliest signs are almost invariably related to episodic memory function, particularly in the person with AD. Deficits in new learning and delayed recall of information precede the diagnosis by several years (<LINK REF="REF-Arnaiz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnaiz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collie 2000</LINK>). Studies have established that associative memory functions, particularly the ability to form arbitrary inter-modal and intra-modal associations, show a striking deficit very early in AD (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowndes-_x0026_-Savage-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowndes &amp; Savage 2007</LINK>). Although deficits noted on measures of episodic memory are central to vascular dementia, people with vascular dementia display a more striking deficit on executive and attention tasks, as well as on measures of semantic knowledge and visuospatial function (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>Pathologically, AD is characterised by the build-up of extra-cellular A&#946; plaques and intra-cellular neurofibrillary tangles, which spread in a predictable and well-described manner through cortical and subcortical regions (<LINK REF="REF-Braak-_x0026_-Braak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braak &amp; Braak 2012</LINK>). In the case of both Alzheimer's and vascular pathology, the pathological cascade commences years or even decades before the onset of obvious clinical symptoms, at which stage individuals are increasingly brought to clinical attention.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-14 13:41:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognition-focused interventions as a group fall under the broader umbrella of non-pharmacological interventions. Cognition-focused interventions can be broadly defined as interventions that directly or indirectly target cognitive functioning as opposed to interventions that focus primarily on behavioural (e.g. wandering), emotional (e.g. anxiety) or physical (e.g. sedentary lifestyle) function. Several types of cognition-based interventions have been described. The potential benefits of non-specific stimulation of cognitive functioning for people with dementia have long been recognised. These interventions typically involve engaging the person with dementia in a range of general activities and discussions, are commonly conducted in groups and are aimed at general enhancement of cognitive and social functioning. A separate recent Cochrane Review, which focuses on interventions that fall under this category (collectively termed 'cognitive stimulation'), has concluded that general cognitive stimulation and reality orientation approaches consistently produce improvements in general cognition and, in some cases, in self-reported quality of life and wellbeing, primarily for people with mild to moderate dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Progress in understanding the operation of memory and related cognitive functions and of the mechanisms underpinning learning has facilitated the development of more specific approaches designed to help maintain or enhance cognitive functioning and wellbeing for people with AD or vascular dementia&#65293;most commonly those in the milder stages. These more recent approaches to cognition-based interventions are most commonly classified as either <I>cognitive training</I> (or 'retraining' or 'remediation' or &#8216;brain training&#8217;) or <I>cognitive rehabilitation</I>. These terms have been and continue to be applied somewhat interchangeably in the literature (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_Prado-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez-Prado 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2010</LINK>); therefore in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2008</LINK>), we have offered the following broad definitions and descriptions with the aim of clarifying the nature of these two related but distinct forms of intervention.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive training</HEADING>
<P>Cognitive training typically involves guided practice on a set of standardised tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions such as memory, attention or problem-solving. Tasks may be presented in paper-and-pencil (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vreese-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Vreese 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quayhagen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Quayhagen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quayhagen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quayhagen 2000</LINK>) or computerised (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann 1996</LINK>) form, or may involve analogues of activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-Farina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farina 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loewenstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loewenstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neely-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neely 2009</LINK>). Tailoring of task difficulty based on individual performance level and adaptive training (i.e. adjustment of task difficulty in response to changes in performance level) are becoming more available through computerised packages (e.g.<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Peretz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peretz 2011</LINK>). One assumption underlying cognitive training is that practice has the potential to improve or at least maintain functioning in the given domain. An additional assumption is that any effects of practice will generalise beyond the immediate training context. Although this last assumption has not often been supported by the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papp 2009</LINK>), some have argued that failure to produce transferable benefits is related in part to problems with task design (<LINK REF="REF-Jaeggi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeggi 2010</LINK>). Some authors have recently broadened the definition of <I>cognitive training</I> to include strategy training, which involves instruction in and practice of strategies designed to minimise cognitive impairment while enhancing performance (e.g. method of loci, visual imagery) and cognitive exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2011</LINK>). Cognitive training may be offered through individual (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vreese-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Vreese 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koltai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Koltai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loewenstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loewenstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farina 2002</LINK>) or group (<LINK REF="STD-Cahn_x002d_Weiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cahn-Weiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koltai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Koltai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ermini-Fuenfsch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ermini Fuenfsch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kesslak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kesslak 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2001</LINK>) sessions or may be facilitated by family members (<LINK REF="STD-Quayhagen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Quayhagen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quayhagen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quayhagen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neely-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neely 2009</LINK>) with therapist support. In accordance with the suggestion that cognitive training may enhance the effects of pharmacological therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Newhouse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newhouse 1997</LINK>), some studies have evaluated the efficacy of cognitive training in combination with the use of acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting (<LINK REF="STD-Cahn_x002d_Weiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cahn-Weiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vreese-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Vreese 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loewenstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loewenstein 2004</LINK>) or other (<LINK REF="STD-Yesavage--1981" TYPE="STUDY">Yesavage 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1993</LINK>) medications. In addition, cognitive training for the person with dementia has sometimes been included as a component of supportive interventions for caregivers (<LINK REF="STD-Brodaty-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brodaty 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodaty-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brodaty 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive rehabilitation</HEADING>
<P>Historically, rehabilitation has been viewed as a process aimed at helping people achieve or maintain an 'optimal level of physical, psychological and social functioning' in the context of specific impairments arising from illness or injury (<LINK REF="REF-McLellan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLellan 1991</LINK>), thus facilitating participation in preferred activities and valued social roles (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). More recent views of rehabilitation include a deeper appreciation of the complex interplay between disease and ability to function: A disability may endure even once the disease that triggered it has been eliminated, and equally, disability can be reduced in the face of permanent injury or even chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2011</LINK>).<I> </I>Cognitive rehabilitation, originally developed mainly through work with younger brain-injured people but equally applicable to progressive conditions, refers to the rehabilitation of people with cognitive impairments. Although the concept continues to evolve, cognitive rehabilitation generally refers to an individualised approach to helping people with cognitive impairments, by which those affected, and their families, work together with healthcare professionals to identify personally relevant goals and to devise strategies for addressing these (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>). The emphasis is not on enhancing performance on cognitive tasks as such, but rather on improving functioning in the everyday context. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions aim to tackle directly those difficulties considered most relevant by the person with dementia and by his or her family members or supporters and to target everyday situations in the real-life context. Cognitive rehabilitation approaches tend to be implemented in real-world settings because there is no implicit assumption that changes instituted in one setting would necessarily generalise to another. Goals for intervention are selected collaboratively, and interventions are usually provided on an individual basis.</P>
<P>Both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation might be accompanied by (1) psychoeducational activities aimed at facilitating an understanding of cognitive strengths and difficulties, and (2) supportive discussion related to individual emotional reactions or other needs; where appropriate, links may be made to other possible sources of support. Table 1 summarizes the main differences between the attributes of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation.</P>

<P>Cognition-based interventions for persons with acquired disorders of the central nervous system (including traumatic brain injury, stroke and neurodegenerative conditions) are driven by knowledge of brain-behaviour relationships and mechanisms of injury, disease and recovery. Historically, such interventions have reflected two broad conceptual frameworks for the recovery of function after brain illness or injury: a traditional or restorative approach, and a contextualised or compensatory approach (<LINK REF="REF-Ylvisaker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylvisaker 2002</LINK>). Techniques usually associated with cognitive training such as the repeated exercise of standardised cognitive tests of increasing difficulty, targeting specific cognitive domains, tend to reflect restorative principles and &#8220;thrive on the lure of neuroplasticity&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Rabipour-_x0026_-Raz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabipour &amp; Raz 2012</LINK>, p. 2). Evidence in support of this comes from a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that reported increased memory-related brain activation following cognitive training in several brain regions of individuals at high risk of dementia due to mild cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Belleville-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belleville 2011</LINK>). Such increased brain activation may be the result of processes of synaptic growth and repair triggered by repeated practice on standardised tests. Techniques usually associated with cognitive rehabilitation, on the other hand, such as optimising residual cognitive abilities in impaired domains and making the most of unimpaired cognitive abilities, lend themselves more to compensatory approaches. For example, in relation to memory and learning, it is well established that the processes of memory encoding and consolidation, as well as the sub-system of declarative memory, tend to be profoundly impaired even in the milder stages of AD (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1998</LINK>). Nevertheless, research has shown that given appropriate conditions and support, and sufficient time, people with dementia can retain the ability to learn and can hold onto some information and skills despite their memory difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_ckman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bäckman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_ckman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bäckman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopelman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopelman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Little-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1986</LINK>). A cognitive rehabilitation approach may focus on helping people with dementia and their families make the most of residual memory ability, for example, by identifying the best ways of taking in important information (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00e4_ckman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bäckman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camp-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2001</LINK>) or by carrying out important real-life practical skills (<LINK REF="REF-Josephsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Josephsson 1993</LINK>). Indeed, several learning principles and techniques (e.g. errorless learning, spaced retrieval) have been found to lead to improved rates of learning and memory among patients with mild dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Boudreaux-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boudreaux 2011</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Clare_x002c_-Wilson-et-al-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare, Wilson et al 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2007</LINK>). It is well documented that despite the severity of memory difficulties, certain memory systems and processes such as implicit memory (e.g. priming, procedural memory) are relatively preserved in the milder stages of AD and vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1996</LINK>). This profile suggests that interventions may aim to build on areas of relative strength reflected in preserved aspects of memory by helping patients develop strategies for learning information via less impaired components of the memory system. Finally, cognitive rehabilitation interventions also attempt to assist patients in developing ways to compensate for impairments in those aspects of memory that are significantly affected (e.g. using external memory aids, making environmental changes), so as to minimise the cognitive demands of various activities (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurlychek-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurlychek 1983</LINK>). Cognitive rehabilitation interventions use these and other techniques to enhance or maintain everyday functioning and wellbeing and to reduce excess disability for the person with dementia, while reducing strain for family caregivers.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-10 09:19:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both pharmacological treatments with cholinesterase inhibitors and cognition-based interventions can be defined as symptomatic treatments in that they do not target hypothesised disease mechanisms. Extensive efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments continue; however, consistently disappointing results from drug trials of various agents have resulted in considerable doubt that disease-modifying treatments can show a positive effect by the time dementia is fully developed (<LINK REF="REF-Salomone-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salomone 2012</LINK>), and efforts in this direction are increasingly being shifted to the pre-dementia or even the pre-symptomatic stage. In contrast, non-pharmacological interventions, particularly cognition-based interventions, are increasingly recognised as an important adjunct and in some cases as an alternative to pharmacological treatments for individuals with dementia and those at risk of dementia. Nevertheless, earlier studies suggested that cognition-based interventions are not appropriate, as they are ineffective and result in frustration and depression among participants and caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1997</LINK>). With growing emphasis on early detection and intervention in dementia care, the need for a clear evidence base for cognition-focused interventions is becoming apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-_x0026_-Clare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods &amp; Clare 2006</LINK>). As was already mentioned, a recent systematic review concluded that general cognitive stimulation and reality orientation provide benefit in terms of the overall cognitive status of patients and aspects of their wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2012</LINK>). Whether or not more targeted approaches such as cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation can produce similarly encouraging outcomes has not yet been determined.</P>
<P>The present review is an update of the original review and updated versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clare-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2008</LINK>). The latest update of this review included 9 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive training and found no evidence for efficacy of cognitive training in relation to cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia. No RCTs of cognitive rehabilitation were found in searches for previous versions of this review; therefore no conclusions could be drawn regarding the efficacy of this type of intervention.</P>
<P>In selecting studies for this review, we have classified interventions on the basis of the ways in which they are described in relation to the definitions previously provided. In some cases, this led to classification of an intervention as &#8216;cognitive training&#8217; even when the term &#8216;cognitive rehabilitation&#8217; was used by the study authors. In other cases, an intervention described as &#8216;cognitive training&#8217; might be deemed to fit more closely with the principles of &#8216;cognitive stimulation&#8217;, thus leading to exclusion from the current review. We acknowledge that the identified categories represent broad definitions and that some cases may reflect an overlap between techniques found in cognitive 'training' and those classified as cognitive 'rehabilitation', which in turn may have some commonalities with cognitive 'stimulation'. Therefore, although the current classification of cognition-based interventions is gradually gaining some consensus among researchers, this classification should remain open to additional refinement in the future.</P>

For consistency with previous versions of the review, we decided to include only studies that were published in the English language.

</UL>
<P>Outcomes for the person with dementia and for the primary caregiver were considered for inclusion in the meta-analysis when they were assessed using scores on at least one standardised test or questionnaire measure. When more than one measure was used to assess a particular outcome (e.g. immediate memory), we included in the comparison the measure on which group differences were observed at post-intervention or follow-up assessments (if relevant), or the measure that ,most resembled the measures contributed by other studies. Behavioural observations and ad hoc measures were considered as additional information.</P>
<P>Rates of attrition and reasons for attrition were noted where available. Drop-out rates in the context of progressive conditions may in part reflect changes in the needs of the individual that prompted a needed change in therapeutic approach. With a progressive condition, individual needs may change during the course of an intervention and follow-up period, requiring implementation of a different approach, but this should not be interpreted as evidence that the approach itself is ineffective.</P>
<P>Outcome measures for the person with dementia seek to identify whether changes are observed after the intervention, and to determine the extent to which these can be attributed to the intervention itself. Given the progressive nature of dementia, improved performance may not necessarily be a goal. Instead, preserved performance on a trained task in the context of a decline in untrained tasks could be interpreted as evidence of efficacy. Differences in the trajectory of change between scores on intervention targets and standardised measures are as important as the overall level of change; for example, maintenance of functioning on a target task in the context of a decline in scores on standardised assessments might indicate that the intervention was effective in relation to the targeted area of functioning.<BR/>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Koltai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Koltai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1988</LINK>) directly reported the data in terms of change from baseline. In the remaining studies, changes from baseline statistics were calculated from group means and standard deviations at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up. <I>Baseline</I> was defined as the latest assessment available before randomisation, but no more than two months before.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-10 10:33:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of risk of bias was conducted by AB-F using The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and was subsequently reviewed by LC. Consistent with the risk of bias tool, study quality was assessed in the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and investigators, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting of outcomes. Studies were rated as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' in each of these domains. There were no disagreements between review authors in ratings of risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-05-10 10:35:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis was conducted on change-from-baseline scores. A zero correlation between measurements at baseline and those at subsequent time points was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline but provides a conservative approach considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis. Outcome measures were treated as continuous measures. In some cases, outcomes were derived from ordinal rating scales; provided these contained a reasonably large number of categories (&gt; 10), the data were treated as continuous variables arising from a normal distribution. There were no examples of binary outcome measures, which would have required an odds ratio calculation.</P>
<P>The mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used whenever studies used the same outcome measure, and the standardised mean difference (SMD), which is the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation, was used when the same outcome was assessed with the use of different measures.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-05-10 10:37:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three types of unit of analysis issues were encountered: cross-over trial designs, multiple treatment groups and repeated assessments. For cross-over trials, only data from the first treatment period were used. In the case of studies that compared more than two treatment groups, the analysis focused on the two groups providing the most pertinent data that most resembled conditions included in other studies. Wherever possible, a condition in which individual cognitive training or rehabilitation was delivered was compared with a condition that included no cognitive intervention. To address the issue of repeated assessments (more than one post-intervention assessment), we intended to conduct separate comparisons to assess outcomes immediately post-intervention (the first post-intervention assessment), short-term outcomes (up to 12 months post-intervention) and longer-term outcomes (more than 12 months post intervention).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-05-10 10:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numbers of participants who commenced and who completed the intervention in each group were noted where available, and these numbers contributed to the assessment of risk due to incomplete outcomes data. Studies generally provided minimal detail on the causes and impact of missing data. In general, it was assumed that data were missing at random, and analyses in individual studies were generally performed per protocol rather than on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>

<P>Inflated estimates of the standard deviation of change scores, associated with the assumption of zero correlation between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores on outcome measures, can potentially obscure real effects of the interventions.

<P>Electronic searches conducted in November 2012, December 2011 and September 2009 retrieved a combined total of 1339 results. Following preliminary screening and removal of duplicate studies by Anna Noel-Storr, Trial Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, 495 records were forwarded to the review authors for further evaluation. After title and abstract review by one review author (AB-F), 49 records were selected for closer assessment, and full records were retrieved and reviewed independently by two review authors (AB-F, LC). Upon review and discussion, three trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria&#65293;two trials describing a cognitive training intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Galante-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Galante 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neely-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neely 2009</LINK>) and one trial describing a cognitive rehabilitation intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>). The two cognitive training studies were added to the nine studies that were included in the previous meta-analysis, bringing the total number of studies in the meta-analysis to 11. Because no previous trials on individualised cognitive rehabilitation had been undertaken, no meta-analysis of cognitive rehabilitation could be performed. The flow of studies through the review process is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>Included studies reported that a total of 117 measures (100 measuring patient outcomes, 17 measuring caregiver outcomes) were used to examine the 22 primary and secondary outcomes selected for examination in this review. For cognitive training interventions, data for meta-analysis were available for 8 of the 14 primary outcomes and for 6 of the 8 secondary outcomes over the short term. Meta-analysis could be performed on 2 of 14 primary outcome measures and on 2 of 8 secondary outcome measures over the medium term. No cognitive training studies reported an outcome measure over the long term. As only one study of cognitive rehabilitation met inclusion criteria for this review, no meta-analysis of cognitive rehabilitation could be conducted.</P>

<P>Significant diversity was noted among the 12 studies on a range of parameters. Seven studies included only participants diagnosed with AD, but the other four included participants diagnosed with AD, vascular dementia or mixed dementia. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Quayhagen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quayhagen 2000</LINK>), participants were included if they were diagnosed with dementia due to Parkinson's disease (PD) in addition to AD and vascular and mixed dementia, but it was not possible to ascertain how many of the included participants had PD, because data for all aetiologies were reported together. Severity of dementia varied in the included studies from very mild to moderate; this was generally determined on the basis of scores on a measure of dementia severity or global cognition (e.g. Clinical Dementia Rating, MMSE). Although not stated explicitly in most studies, it appears that in most cases, patients were recruited from the community; in a small number of studies, patients who resided in residential care homes were also included. The duration of interventions provided in the included studies varied considerably, ranging from 4 to 24 weeks. Four studies reported follow-up assessments over the medium term; these occurred at 8 weeks, as well as at 3, 6 and 9 months, after the end of treatment. The content of the interventions also varied considerably, ranging from training in the use of compensatory strategies to practice on computerised tasks to working toward achieving collaboratively derived goals. Selected features of the included studies are further described here and are summarised in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

Raw data for the group receiving cognitive training alone were not reported in the 1998 paper and are no longer available. The design was subsequently amended as caregivers were dissatisfied with the possibility of receiving cognitive training alone, so the comparisons reported in 2001 and augmented with further information from the author involve three groups: AChEI alone, cognitive training plus AChEI and active control. For the purposes of this review, the comparison of interest lies in the difference between AChEI alone and cognitive training plus AChEI.</P>

<P>Because only a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>) met criteria for inclusion in this review, no meta-analysis could be conducted. <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> shows the results for a selected number of important outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>. As can be seen, cognitive rehabilitation was found to be superior to the control condition in the primary outcome of patient-reported improvement in goal performance over the short term as measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (effect size Z = 2.11, P = 0.04). Cognitive rehabilitation was also found to be superior to the control condition in relation to outcomes not shown in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, Specifically, participants in the cognitive rehabilitation group rated themselves as more satisfied with their ability to carry out meaningful activities of daily living compared with the control condition immediately following the intervention, and they were more satisfied with their memory performance six months after the intervention compared with the control group. A trend that approached significance suggested that six months after the intervention, participants in the cognitive rehabilitation group rated their overall quality of life as higher than that of participants in the control condition (<LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>). Evidence also indicated that caregivers of participants in the cognitive rehabilitation group had improved social relationships after the intervention relative to the control condition. Finally, in a subset of participants who underwent functional neuroimaging with fMRI while performing a learning task, cognitive rehabilitation was associated with an increase in brain activation relative to the control condition in the right fusiform face area&#65293;the right medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, although participants in the control condition showed lower brain activation after the intervention in the right parahippocampal cortex and in the right temporal parietal junction, no reduction in brain activity in these regions was noted for the group that underwent cognitive rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Paasschen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Paasschen 2013</LINK>).

<P>The aim of this updated review was to evaluate current evidence regarding the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation interventions for people with mild AD or vascular dementia. Eleven studies of cognitive training were identified for inclusion in the review (nine of which were included in the previous version of this review), and meta-analysis could be conducted on 8 primary and 6 secondary outcomes in the short term, and on 2 primary and 2 secondary outcome measures in the medium term. No positive or adverse effects of cognitive training were detected in the meta-analysis. The finding of no adverse effects of cognitive training is relevant in light of proposals from previous commentators (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Small-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1997</LINK>) that cognitive training may have a negative impact, particularly on mood.</P>
<P>Only one RCT of individualised cognitive rehabilitation was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>). Hence, no meta-analysis could be conducted. Howevever, the results of this single, high-quality trial are positive, indicating that cognitive rehabilitation is likely to provide some benefit for patients in the short term and in the medium term related to self-rated competence and satisfaction in performing meaningful personal goals, memory capacity and general quality of life.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of publications meeting inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Since the publication of the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2008</LINK>), only two additional RCTs of cognitive training in participants with AD or vascular dementia were published that met the review criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Galante-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Galante 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neely-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neely 2009</LINK>). In addition, only a single study met our inclusion criteria for individual cognitive rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Clare-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Clare 2010</LINK>). Several factors appear to account for the small number of new studies that met criteria for the present review. First, insufficient methodological quality, namely, the absence of randomisation, led to several published trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bentwich-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bentwich 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2012</LINK>) not being included in the review. Second, several RCTs of cognition-based interventions did not meet our definitions of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation, or they described multi-component interventions (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Graff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Graff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kurz 2012</LINK>). Issues related to the inclusion criteria used in the current review are further discussed later. A third factor that may have contributed to inclusion of a smaller number of relevant studies in the literature is likely to be associated with the widely held belief that interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological alike, have the greatest chance of success when applied in the earliest possible stage of AD or vascular dementia. Hence, in recent years studies have increasingly targeted individuals who do not meet criteria for dementia, but who nevertheless show significant cognitive decline&#65293;such as persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (<LINK REF="REF-Albert-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gauthier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauthier 2006</LINK>). Indeed, many of the records that were retrieved in the updated literature search now exclusively focus on individuals with MCI, and separate reviews focusing on individuals with MCI are now available (<LINK REF="REF-Jean-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jean 2010</LINK>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Issues related to the inclusion of RCTs only</HEADING>
<P>The original protocol for the current review (<LINK REF="REF-Clare_x002c_-Woods_x002c_-Moniz_x002d_Cook-et-al-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare, Woods, Moniz-Cook et al 2001</LINK>) stated that only RCTs would be included in the review. RCTs have been long regarded as the highest forms of evidence in medical research because of the lower risk of bias associated with them. However, most of the studies of cognitive training included in the present review have been rated as having substantial risk of bias in several domains, and the quality of evidence has been found to be low to moderate. Low-quality RCTs can in principle be associated with a greater threat to internal validity of the study than high-quality non-randomised trials and even well conducted single-case studies. Hence, although more recent studies are generally of a higher methodological quality, this trend is likely to continue, it might be justifiable to include, under strict conditions, high-quality non-randomised trials and single-case studies in future versions of this review to increase the evidence base from which conclusions can be drawn. Several possible advantages are derived by including high-quality non-randomised trials in a systematic review, and pooled estimates of effect sizes from randomised and non-randomised trials can be analysed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Issues related to definitions of interventions and multi-component interventions</HEADING>
<P>Despite progress in the application of a clearer and more consistent terminology in referring to various cognition-based interventions in mild dementia, interventions often continue to be inaccurately labelled. Specifically, studies continue to be published in which interventions are described as cognitive training or as cognitive rehabilitation, when in fact they appear to more closely reflect cognitive stimulation or reality orientation (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2010</LINK>). This state of affairs means that, in reviewing the available literature and in choosing studies to include in the review, it was generally insufficient to examine the title used in the publication, and in many cases, the Methods section of a published trial had to be closely scrutinised to clarify whether the intervention actually provided was consistent with the one suggested by the title. </P>
<P>In addition, the present review excluded trials in which an intervention was described as a combination of elements from various approaches&#65293;such as cognitive behaviour therapy combined with elements of cognition-focused intervention (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Kurz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kurz 2012</LINK>). This decision is related to the fact that different techniques are likely to have different mechanisms of action, and that it is generally not possible with such interventions to isolate the contributions of different components to the measured outcomes. The definitions of cognition-based interventions provided in this review essentially reflect groups of intervention techniques that tend to go together, but some overlap has been noted in the techniques used in cognitive stimulation, training and rehabilitation (e.g. psychoeducation may be a component of each of these approaches). Because each of these broad approaches to intervention is likely to involve the use of more than one intervention technique with different mechanisms of action (e.g. setting goals, discovering effective ways to learn new information, using repeated practice), these approaches can also be regarded as essentially &#8216;multi-component&#8217; interventions. Additional work is required to better characterise the essential or core components of each of the broad approaches to intervention. It is possible that inclusion of studies based on their use of discrete intervention techniques (e.g. goal-setting, practice of structured tasks, use of specific learning strategies such as errorless learning) rather than on whether they neatly fit into the definitions offered here might prove more informative.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes measured in included studies</HEADING>
<P>A further issue influencing the completeness and applicability of the evidence is the range of outcomes reported in the included studies. Trials, particularly studies of cognitive training, have traditionally measured mainly cognitive outcomes in the form of performance on standardised cognitive measures. Very few studies have measured non-cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia or for the primary caregiver (e.g. mood, quality of life, general health and wellbeing) or longer-term outcomes that are likely to be of critical importance to policy-makers, such as those related to the course of dementia, for example, dementia severity and rates of admission to residential care. Although obvious methodological constraints are applied to the measurement of longer-term outcomes, such as admission to residential care, it is nonetheless important that future trials of cognition-based interventions, particularly those found to be effective, routinely measure and report outcomes other than direct cognitive ones, and that attempts are made to capture outcomes related to the future trajectory of dementia. Given the nature and aims of individualised cognitive rehabilitation interventions, these approaches tend to emphasize individualised goals and activities of daily living over performance on standardised cognitive tests. Indeed, the single trial of cognitive rehabilitation included in the present review measured and reported several important outcomes other than cognitive outcomes that are of direct clinical relevance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological limitations of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The lack of significant effects achieved in cognitive training studies must be interpreted in the context of methodological limitations that may have constrained the possibility of demonstrating significant gains, including issues related to power, choice of control condition and choice of outcome measures along with the impact of individual characteristics that may moderate treatment response.</P>
<P>
<I>Power to detect effects:</I> Many of the included trials are likely to have suffered from limited statistical power to detect effects. Lack of power of individual studies to detect effects is commonly associated with small sample sizes, which is a frequent limitation in cognition-based interventions for people with mild AD and vascular dementia. However, this explanation is unlikely to account for the lack of significant findings, as a meta-analysis is designed to overcome limitations derived from individual studies associated with such factors as sample size. Indeed, not only was the size of the effects in individual studies small, but, and this is possibly of greater relevance, the direction of effects associated with some outcomes did not consistently favour cognitive training over the control condition. For example, in three out of five studies that reported the impact of cognitive training on a global measure of cognition in the short term, the direction of the effect favoured the control group, whereas in only one of the trials did the effect clearly favour the cognitive training condition (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Indeed, such inconsistency in the direction of effects was found to be the case for a substantial number of outcomes reported by the studies, even when the same measures were used by different studies to evaluate a given outcome. Other factors that might contribute to the difficulty involved in detecting significant effects are difficulties in determining the right &#8216;dose&#8217; of an intervention (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration of interventions), the presence of 'ceiling' or 'floor' effects, rendering it impossible to demonstrate improvements in a given domain, and baseline differences between treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>
<I>Choice of control condition:</I> The difficulty of defining what constitutes an appropriate comparison condition is particularly important because in some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Cahn_x002d_Weiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cahn-Weiner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loewenstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loewenstein 2004</LINK>) cognitive training may have been compared with other active treatments, thus masking potentially beneficial effects. Clinical practice requires the ability to distinguish which of a range of possible psychosocial interventions is most likely to be useful for a given individual, and the study designs used here do not allow this question to be addressed.</P>
<P>
<I>Use of neuropsychological tests as cognitive outcomes:</I> The use of neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive outcomes effectively means that what is actually being assessed is transfer of benefit from trained to untrained tasks, rather than the effects of training on trained tasks. However, as was discussed in the introduction, very limited evidence has been found to support such transfer effects from trained to untrained tasks. When the trained tasks are analogous in some way to daily activities, however, improvement in such tasks may have direct relevance to daily functioning, but this would be missed if these benefits were not transferred to performance on standardised neuropsychological tests. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2001</LINK> noted improvement on tasks during training, such as recall of personal information and face-name associations, but this was not captured by the neuropsychological measures selected to assess cognitive outcomes. A further problem with the use of standardised neuropsychological tests before and after the intervention to measure cognitive outcomes involves the potential for practice effects that may obscure possible effects of specific treatments. Finally, in some studies, more than one neuropsychological test or self-report scale is used to measure the same outcome (e.g. executive function, general wellbeing). This leads to difficulties in choosing which is the most appropriate or relevant measure of the outcome under consideration for inclusion in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<I>Moderating role of patient characteristics in intervention outcomes:</I> Investigators have learned that various patient characteristics have the potential to moderate response to the intervention, and as more evidence becomes available regarding important moderators, cognition-focused interventions might be better able to control for the effects of such moderators. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Koltai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Koltai 2001</LINK> retrospectively classified participants' level of awareness of their own impairments and found that a higher level of awareness was a predictor of a more successful outcome&#65293;a finding that has also been demonstrated in a prospective study of cognitive rehabilitation outcomes for a small group of people with mild AD (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2004</LINK>). The moderating impact of factors such as awareness of deficits or the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. apathy) may strengthen the rationale for inclusion of high-quality single-case studies in future versions of this review.</P>

<I>Study context:</I> Non-pharmacological studies are more likely than drug trials to be affected by the study context, including the healthcare setting, as well as by cultural and linguistic factors. Given that the studies reviewed have taken place in a variety of contexts, one cannot exclude the possibility that cognition-based interventions are better suited for some contexts than others.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-14 10:37:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As has been discussed, the generally low methodological quality of trials continues to limit the ability of researchers to evaluate the evidence base. The quality of most of the studies of cognitive training interventions included in the review was often compromised by significant risks of bias&#65293;particularly as a result of insufficient detail regarding the method used to generate a random group allocation sequence, concealment of this sequence from relevant members of the research team and attempts to blind participants, researchers or both to group allocation. Hence, the finding of no significant benefit (or harm) from cognitive training interventions needs to be interpreted with caution, and the estimate of effect sizes may vary in the future as the evidence comes from studies of greater quality. However, the methodological quality of trials is gradually improving, and this trend is expected to continue in coming years. Indeed, although only a single study of individualised cognitive rehabilitation was identified, this study was rated to be of high methodological quality and hence to have lower risk of bias&#65293;permitting the drawing of positive conclusions regarding the efficacy of this approach. Although effect estimates that are based on high-quality evidence are generally regarded as estimates that are unlikely to change significantly with the publication of further studies, confidence in the positive outcomes of cognitive rehabilitation will nevertheless increase as evidence accumulates from further high-quality, preferably multi-site, trials of cognitive rehabilitation with larger sample sizes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-14 05:15:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In recent years, two main systematic reviews that included an examination of the efficacy of cognitive training for people with mild dementia have been published. In reviewing the literature to 2004, <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> concluded that &#8220;cognitive training evidenced promise in the treatment of AD, with primarily medium effect sizes for learning, memory, executive functions, activities of daily living, general cognitive problems, depression, and self-rated general functioning&#8221;. Closer examination of the methodology described in <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> reveals important differences that explain the inconsistency in the results of the current review. First, <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> applied inclusion criteria that were much less strict and included both randomised and non-randomised trials (total 19), as well as studies that included participants with moderate to severe AD. Second, although <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> described their review as a review of cognitive training, of the 14 RCTs that met their inclusion criteria, 6 were in fact studies of other cognition-based interventions (primarily reality orientation/cognitive stimulation) or multi-component interventions. Indeed, in separate analyses, performed only on the five &#8220;high-quality trials&#8221; (all of which were included in the current review)&#65293;the observed effects were very small and non-significant. It is quite plausible that if studies of cognitive stimulation, training and rehabilitation for people with mild AD or vascular dementia were assessed together, some benefits would have been detected. However, given the important differences among the various cognition-focused approaches to intervention, these should be treated separately. Indeed, although the current review did not identify any benefits associated with cognitive training, the results of a single, high-quality trial of cognitive rehabilitation tentatively suggest that this approach may be associated with important benefits for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver. In addition, a separate Cochrane review of cognitive stimulation for mild AD has recently confirmed that this approach was associated with several positive outcomes for the person with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK> reviewed the general literature on the efficacy of 26 categories of non-pharmacological interventions for people with dementia. In relation to cognitive training, these authors concluded that a Grade B recommendation (recommendation associated with low-quality RCTs) can be given for the efficacy of individual and group cognitive training in improving cognitive functions. No effects of cognitive training on other outcomes were found. This conclusion seems to be different from that of the current review, and important differences are evident between this review and that of <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK>. Specifically, <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK> included in their review participants with any kind of dementia, and in fact allowed for inclusion of a small proportion of participants with cognitive decline but without confirmed dementia. In addition, like <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK> used less strict inclusion criteria, leading to inclusion of several low-quality studies. Finally, rather than examining different cognitive domains separately, <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK> analysed cognition broadly, and studies contributed diverse measures of cognition to the evaluation of this outcome, whereas cognitive outcomes in the current study were evaluated separately against widely agreed cognitive domains. These methodological differences are most likely to account for the differences between the current review and the review by <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK>. </P>

<P>
<I>Cognitive training:</I> The review does not provide evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures.</P>
<P>
<I>Cognitive rehabilitation:</I> Data from a single, high-quality trial provide preliminary positive results regarding the use of contextualised individual cognitive rehabilitation, emphasising collaborative goal-setting to achieve better self-rated competence and satisfaction with personally meaningful activities of daily living. Risk of harm or adverse effects of cognitive rehabilitation are unlikely. Given that the evidence to date comes from a single trial, the overall quality of evidence is best described as moderate. The capacity to make firmer treatment recommendations awaits the publication of additional trials of individual cognitive rehabilitation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-13 11:05:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Cognitive training:</I> Further well-designed single-blind RCTs of cognitive training would help to provide more definitive evidence regarding efficacy. Future research would benefit from consideration of how to capture changes that are currently missed by the available standardised outcome measures, from development of greater consensus in the selection of specific outcome measures and from identification of the extent to which gains are clinically relevant and generalisable, and have the potential to make a difference for the person with dementia and the family caregiver in everyday life. Future research should continue the trend towards devising interventions that include personalised tasks or tasks based on analogues of daily activities. Future research also needs to consider outcomes beyond direct cognitive ones, to describe in greater detail the elements of the intervention used (preferably using manualised protocols) and to more accurately use existing classifications of cognition-based interventions.</P>
<P>
<I>Cognitive rehabilitation:</I> Additional RCTs of individualised cognitive rehabilitation are needed to provide further support for tentatively promising results.</P>

<P>The intervention was a structured, multi-component intervention that has previously been variously described by the authors as 'cognitive resource-oriented therapy' or as 'neuropsychologically informed behaviour therapy'. The intervention was said to draw on principles from psychotherapy and neurorehabilitation, and included a range of elements such as reminiscence, activity scheduling, use of memory aids and coping skills for managing memory difficulties. Hence the active ingredients could not be separated out, and the study was excluded.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Participants were randomly assigned by coin-toss. This type of simple randomisation tends to yield different group sizes with small samples (N &lt; 100). Given that the intervention and control groups were of equal size (n = 17), it is unlikely that simple randomisation was used, and randomisation was most likely done in blocks. In addition, the authors state that the coin-toss was performed at the time consent was obtained, which would have been before the baseline assessment. This approach is generally more prone to bias than when the randomisation sequence is performed after baseline assessment has been completed.</P>

They had on average scores on the MMSE that were 1 point lower than those of the intervention groups and 2 points lower than those of the control group.

Given the small quantity of incomplete data and the relatively even spread, the results are not likely to have been biased by incomplete data. Given that the participant excluded from the CR group as the result of a changed diagnosis had results in the same direction as that reported for the CR group, his exclusion is unlikely to have biased the results.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>No information was provided in the article. However, participants would have been aware of their group allocation. In addition, although not stated explicitly, the person or persons delivering the intervention would have been aware of group allocation. Support for this is found in the description of the individual training group: "...the training was conducted without any involvement of the caregiver. Instead, the support strategies were provided by a research assistant, rather than by the spousal caregiver".</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The placebo condition provided a control for therapist attention and level of interaction between caregiver and care recipient. It is not clear, however, whether participants were<BR/>aware of the condition to which they were assigned. The authors note that some members of the placebo group appeared to initiate active processing of the tasks, and this may have led to a confound between the two conditions. It is not clear who exactly carried out the interventions and whether the same individuals delivered interventions in the experimental and placebo groups. It is unlikely that those carrying out the interventions were blinded to group allocation.</P>
