<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-27 13:13:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Use of pregabalin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs can reduce the frequency of seizures, but has some adverse effects. The overall evidence for reducing seizures was rated as moderate in quality.</P>
<P>Approximately one in 400 people have epileptic seizures that continue despite antiepileptic drug treatment. This review summarises data from six trials that included a total of 2009 participants. In addition to their usual antiepileptic drugs, participants were randomised to take pregabalin (an antiepileptic drug) or control drug. Results showed that patients taking pregabalin were two to three times more likely to reduce their seizure frequency by more than 50% than those taking placebo and two to three times more likely to increase seizure freedom over a 12-week interval. Pregabalin was shown to be effective across a range of doses (150 mg to 600 mg) with increasing effectiveness at higher doses. There was also an increasing likelihood of treatment withdrawal. Side effects associated with pregabalin included co-ordination problems, dizziness, sleepiness, and weight gain.</P>
<P>All included studies were rated as low or unclear in risk of bias. Overall, the risk of bias was rated as unclear due to a suspicion of publication bias. Publication bias may occur when studies that report non-significant findings are not published. In this review, authors suspected this bias because all the included studies showed significant findings and they were all sponsored by the same drug company. Evidence was further rated as moderate in quality for the primary outcome of seizure reduction.</P>
<P>A limitation of this review is that there are no data regarding the longer-term effectiveness of pregabalin and this should be investigated in future studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-03 10:06:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the UK. Approximately one third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. In order to try to improve outcomes a number of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed and pregabalin is one of these. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<A HREF="Pulman 2008">Pulman 2008</A>); no further studies have been added since the previous update in 2012 and only one study has been identified as an ongoing trial.</P>

<P>To summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on antiepileptic treatment in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. The definitions of drug resistance used were those employed by the authors of the included trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-27 13:13:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (Jan 2014), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 09/01/2014) and contacted Pfizer Ltd. (the manufacturers of pregabalin) to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-11 10:31:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Outcomes included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal for adverse events and nature of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-27 13:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors (JP and AGM) independently selected and assessed suitable trials and extracted data. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat (ITT). Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Included studies were assessed for risk of bias by two authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-27 13:13:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Six suitable industry-sponsored trials (2009 participants) were identified and included in the analysis. Trials tested doses of pregabalin ranging from 50 mg/day to 600 mg/day. For the primary outcome, 50% or higher seizure reduction was significantly more likely in patients randomised to pregabalin than to placebo (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.01). A dose-response analysis suggested increasing effect with increasing dose. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.05 to 6.36). Patients were significantly more likely to have withdrawn from pregabalin treatment than placebo treatment for any reason (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.72) or for adverse effects (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain were significantly associated with pregabalin. The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.54). Overall, the evidence was rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to the possibility of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate using the GRADE approach.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-25 08:50:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant partial epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at achieving a 50% or greater seizure reduction and significantly increasing seizure freedom. Results demonstrate efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making better.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-04 14:18:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-27 11:39:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological chronic condition affecting up to 1% of the UK population (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1990</LINK>). A single antiepileptic drug (AED) (monotherapy) will induce remission for the majority of those diagnosed. However, up to 30% of patients will fail to respond to monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Their continuing attacks will result in reduced quality of life, and may also lead to injuries, social isolation and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Villeneuve-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villeneuve 2004</LINK>). This group poses a significant therapeutic problem, leading to the development of new AEDs as well as exploration of non-pharmacological treatment options, such as vagal nerve stimulation and epilepsy surgery.</P>
<P>Since the 1990s numerous new AEDs have become available, raising hope for more potent and better tolerated treatment of epilepsy. Pregabalin is one of these new compounds with antiepileptic, analgesic and anxiolytic (anxiety reducing) properties. It acts through binding to an auxiliary protein (alpha 2 delta) of the voltage-gated calcium channels. It has been shown to reduce calcium influx into nerve terminals resulting in reduced presynaptic release of glutamate. In addition, by acting on AMPA (&#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors it indirectly reduces synaptic noradrenaline release (<LINK REF="REF-Fink-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 2002</LINK>). These actions are thought to mediate its antiepileptic, anxiolytic and analgesic properties. Pregabalin has favourable pharmacokinetics; it is not protein bound, is 90% bioavailable and reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1.5 hours of administration of an oral dose. With repeated doses, a steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. Furthermore, 90% of the drug is eliminated, un-metabolised, by the kidneys and it has no drug interactions (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2005</LINK>). Pregabalin was launched onto the UK market in 2004 as an add-on AED for partial-onset seizures, as well as a treatment for neuropathic pain, and more recently (2006) as an anxiolytic.</P>
<P>Clinical trials published on the antiepileptic properties of pregabalin so far have focused on patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. In these randomised placebo-controlled trials, patients are randomised to have either pregabalin or placebo added to their existing AED treatment. This is in keeping with international guidelines on the development of AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE Commission 1989</LINK>). Once a drug has confirmed efficacy and safety as an add-on therapy, it can be tested as monotherapy. The use of pregabalin as monotherapy will be the subject of a future Cochrane review.</P>
<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review and aims to summarise existing data regarding the effects of add-on pregabalin for patients with refractory partial-onset seizures. This review is one in a series in which the efficacy and tolerability of seven new AEDs (gabapentin, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, zonisamide and pregabalin) are investigated in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Findings from the previous review showed significant seizure reduction in users of pregabalin compared to controls. Seizure freedom was significantly increased with the use of pregabalin. Pregabalin users were more likely to withdraw from the study than controls and significant adverse events associated with pregabalin were ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain.</P>

We examined statistical heterogeneity using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for heterogeneity and, providing no significant heterogeneity was present (P &gt; 0.10), we employed a fixed-effect model. In the event that heterogeneity was found, we planned to use a random-effects model analysis using the inverse variance method.</P>

<P>We requested all protocols from study authors to enable a comparison of outcomes of interest. We planned to investigate outcome reporting bias using the ORBIT matrix system (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2010</LINK>). We also intended to examine asymmetry of funnel plots to establish any publication bias. However, there were insufficient number of studies to allow funnel plots to be used, therefore, a judgement was made based on the characteristics of the studies.</P>

<P>Six randomised, controlled, parallel trials are included in this review; these had been sponsored by the company Pfizer Ltd. A total of 2009 participants were randomised into these studies. All six of the included studies recruited participants with treatment-resistant partial seizures. Participants were taking between one and four AEDs and had at least three partial seizures per month in the pre-randomisation baseline period. Further details are given below and in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Arroyo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Arroyo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Arroyo 2004</LINK>) published a multicentre (45 sites in Europe, Australia and Africa) parallel trial in 2004 on 288 patients. Inclusion criteria were defined as patients 18 years or older with partial seizures. As an electroencephalogram (EEG) was not required to confirm the above, some of the 18 patients included who were stated to have 'generalised seizures' rather than secondary generalised, may have had primary generalised epilepsy. Treatment arms included 99 patients on 50 mg pregabalin three times daily (TDS) and 92 patients on 200 mg pregabalin TDS, while 97 patients were randomised to placebo. After a baseline assessment of eight weeks the trial was conducted over 12 weeks (including titration period of four and eight days). During the trial period patients were assessed weekly for the first two weeks and fortnightly thereafter. Median follow-up was 12 weeks (range one day to 12 weeks). Three time points were reported in the study, each at four-weekly intervals.</P>
<P>Baulac et al (<LINK REF="STD-Baulac-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baulac 2010</LINK>) conducted a multicentre (97 sites in Europe, Canada and Australia) parallel trial on 434 patients. Randomised patients were between 16 and 82 years of age and had undergone an EEG within two years prior to randomisation. Treatment arms were 150 mg to 300 mg pregabalin twice daily (BD) (n = 152), 150 mg to 300 mg lamotrigine twice daily (BD) (n = 141) and 141 patients were randomised to the placebo arm. Following a six-week baseline period, treatment was conducted over 12 weeks following a five-week titration phase (one week for pregabalin and five weeks for lamotrigine). The lamotrigine titration phase started four weeks prior to the pregabalin titration phase so all patients started the treatment phase on the same dose. Patient review time points and follow-up were not reported.</P>
<P>Beydoun et al (<LINK REF="STD-Beydoun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beydoun 2005</LINK>) randomised 313 patients aged 17 to 82 years from 43 US and Canadian centres. Parallel groups included 111 individuals on 200 mg pregabalin TDS, 104 on 300 mg pregabalin BD and 98 on placebo. After a baseline assessment of eight weeks the trial was conducted over 12 weeks (including a one-week titration period). Follow-up occurred on weeks two, four, eight and 12. Median follow-up was 12 weeks (range not reported). During the trial an interim analysis was carried out on 129 patients. This led to alteration of the statistical analysis.</P>
<P>Elger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Elger-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elger 2005</LINK>) reported a multicentre (53 sites in Canada and Europe) parallel trial of 341 patients aged 17 to 78 years. Treatment arms were 150 to 600 mg pregabalin (n = 131) titrated to clinical response and adverse effects in 150 mg daily increments and fixed-dose pregabalin of 300 mg BD (n = 137). A total of 73 people received placebo. Patients were randomised to one of the three treatments using a 1:2:2 ratio. The trial ran over 12 weeks and followed a six-week baseline period. Patients were reviewed at two, four, eight and 12 weeks into the study. Median follow-up was 12 weeks and over 58% of patients completed the study in each arm. Range of follow-up was not reported.</P>
<P>French et al (<LINK REF="STD-French-2003" TYPE="STUDY">French 2003</LINK>) published a multicentre (76 sites in US and Canada) parallel trial including 455 patients. Randomised patients were between 12 and 70 years of age, but not all had EEG and imaging data. Those with absence seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were excluded; however, the inclusion of some patients with primary generalised epilepsy could not be ruled out. Participants were randomised into one of five treatment arms; 50 mg/day (n = 88), 150 mg/day (n = 88), 300 mg/day (n = 90) and 600 mg/day (n = 89) pregabalin in a BD regimen, and 100 patients were in the placebo group. Baseline assessment occurred over eight weeks and trial duration was 12 weeks with no titration period. Follow-up occurred on weeks two, four, eight and 12. Median follow-up was 12 weeks (range one day to 12 weeks). Around 83% of patients completed the study.</P>
<P>Lee et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK>) conducted a multicentre (nine sites in Korea) parallel trial consisting of two treatment arms. A total of 178 patients, aged 18 years and above, were randomised to either 75 mg to 300 mg pregabalin BD (n = 119) or placebo (n = 59) using a 2:1 ratio. Following a six-week baseline period, treatment was conducted over 12 weeks with a one-week taper period at the end.

A sensitivity analysis showed two studies contributing largely to the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="STD-Baulac-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baulac 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK>) therefore a random-effects model was employed for this outcome. See <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> for further details. Those participants allocated pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (risk ratio (RR) 2.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70 to 4.01) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Subgroup analyses assessing the effect of individual doses show no significant effect for 50 mg pregabalin (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.12). Higher doses of pregabalin were significantly associated with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (150 mg: RR 2.22; 95% CI 1.36 to 3.63; 300 mg: RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.65 to 4.94; 600 mg: RR 2.86; 95% CI 2.32 to 3.54; titrated 150 to 600mg: RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.42 to 5.76) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>A best-case analysis (all drop-outs assumed to be responders to treatment) pooling across doses (50 mg to 600 mg/day) showed participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 3.60; 95% CI 2.93 to 4.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

Subgroup analyses by dose showed one dose (50 mg) to be significantly associated with seizure reduction in the placebo group compared to pregabalin (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99). There were no significant differences between groups for all other doses (150 mg: RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.96; 300 mg: RR 1.48; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 600 mg: RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.43; titrated 150 to 600mg: RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.46).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-03 11:53:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review is one in a series of reviews analysing effects of new AEDs on treatment-resistant localisation-related epilepsy. We identified six industry-sponsored (Pfizer Ltd.) randomised placebo-controlled parallel trials. All studies were of good methodological quality and most were randomised using suitable sequence generation methods; all studies did not report methods of concealing allocation; all were reported to be double-blinded and had few patients lost to follow-up. Summary trial data were taken from the relevant publications and individual patient data were not obtained. The approach to analysis for all of the included trials used the last-observation-carried-forwards. For participants failing to complete follow-up, seizure frequency data were extrapolated to the whole treatment period, while for participants with no seizure data during the treatment period, baseline data were extrapolated. While this approach may help minimise bias due to losses to follow-up (and is preferred by drug regulatory authorities), its use must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of this systematic review.</P>
<P>The included studies tested doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 600 mg/day. The results showed that pregabalin, when used as add-on treatment, can reduce seizure frequency in individuals with treatment-resistant localisation-related epilepsy. In the analysis, when all doses of pregabalin were pooled, the RR for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 2.61 (95% CI 1.70 to 4.01), thus demonstrating that out of 100 people with refractory epilepsy 40 are likely to have their seizures reduced when taking pregabalin compared to 15 out of 100 people not taking pregabalin. The large heterogeneity statistic associated with this result led to a sensitivity analysis that revealed two studies to be contributing largely. There were three main reasons for this: one study <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK> was conducted in Korea and used a non-Western population sample and both studies, <LINK REF="STD-Baulac-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baulac 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK>, were conducted at later times and therefore treatment regimens may have been different from earlier therapies. Both of these trials had the 150 mg/day to 300 mg/day BD and 75 mg/day to 300 mg/day BD treatment arms, therefore heterogeneity could also be due to the range of doses administered within the studies. Heterogeneity between studies was not found for any of the other outcomes.</P>
<P>A generalised linear mixed-model analysis showed evidence of a dose effect, suggesting that using pregabalin as an add-on treatment at 600 mg dose doubles the odds of reducing seizures compared to 300 mg. Participants taking pregabalin were also found to be more likely to be free of seizures than controls.</P>
<P>Participants were more likely to withdraw for any reason or because of adverse effects from pregabalin than from placebo. In both cases, treatment withdrawal was more likely on higher doses. Although the assessment of adverse events showed that ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain were significantly associated with pregabalin, these adverse events were not documented using a checklist or other systematic approach, but required physician reporting, so event rates may have been underestimated.</P>
<P>The one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baulac-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baulac 2010</LINK>) that examined the effectiveness of pregabalin in comparison to another add-on drug (lamotrigine) showed that pregabalin was more effective in reducing seizure frequency than lamotrigine. Participants taking pregabalin were no more likely to be free of seizures than participants taking lamotrigine. Participants taking pregabalin were not more likely to withdraw from the study than participants taking lamotrigine. This was found for both any reason for withdrawal and due to adverse events. Only dizziness was found to be significantly more prevalent when taking pregabalin.</P>
<P>In summary, pregabalin (150 mg/day to 600 mg/day) as an add-on drug can effectively reduce seizures by 50% or more in people with partial epilepsy. The addition of pregabalin doubled seizure freedom, however was found to have four significant adverse effects, ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-27 13:13:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The evidence for the primary outcome of seizure reduction was assessed for quality using the GRADE approach and presenting in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Overall, the evidence was rated as moderate evidence due to large statistical heterogeneity and the possibility of publication bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-03 11:54:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the short term (12 weeks) 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day of pregabalin given in a twice or three times daily regimen can significantly reduce seizure frequency and significantly increase seizure freedom rates in people with treatment-resistant partial epilepsy. Adverse events significantly associated with pregabalin were ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain. There are currently no data regarding cost-effectiveness, longer-term effectiveness of pregabalin versus placebo and, more importantly, versus other adjunctive treatments.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-05-25 08:52:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To improve clinical decisions, further clinical trials are required in adults or children, or both with drug-refractory partial epilepsy. These trials should:</P>
<OL>
<LI>compare efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin with other adjunctive treatments;</LI>
<LI>be of long-term duration (at least 12 months);</LI>
<LI>assess seizure freedom rates, quality of life and health economic outcomes;</LI>
<LI>establish cost-effectiveness and compare it with that of other AEDs.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Further data are also necessary regarding pregnancy outcomes, which will require the recruitment of women taking pregabalin to ongoing pregnancy registries.</P>
