<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Birth control pills with two phases versus three phases</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Side effects of birth control pills may keep women from using them as planned. Attempts to decrease side effects led to the three-phase pill in the 1980s. Pills with phases provide different amounts of hormones over three weeks. Whether three-phase pills lead to fewer pregnancies than two-phase pills is unknown. Nor is it known if the pills give better cycle control or have fewer side effects. This review looked at whether two-phase pills worked as well as three-phase pills. We also studied whether women had fewer side effects with these pills.</P>
<P>We did a computer search for studies of birth control pills with two phases versus pills with three phases. We also wrote to researchers and manufacturers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language. </P>
<P>We found only two trials that looked at two-phase versus three-phase birth control pills. The studies did not have good methods and the authors did not report all their methods. Many women dropped out of the studies, which affects what can be said about the results. One study compared two types of two-phase pills with a three-phase pill. The pills did not differ in any major ways, including the numbers of women who stopped using the pills due to health problems. The other trial compared a two-phase pill with two different three-phase pills. The two-phase pill had worse bleeding patterns than the three-phase pill with a different hormone (levonorgestrel). In contrast, bleeding with the two-phase pill was like that of the three-phase pill with the same hormone (norethindrone). The type of hormone may be more important than the phases for cycle control.</P>
<P>These trials did not provide enough evidence to say if three-phase pills worked any better than two-phase types for birth control, bleeding patterns, or staying on the pill. More research would be needed to show whether three-phase pills were better than two-phase pills. However, two-phase pills are not used enough to justify further research.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-05-03 21:21:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-24 20:06:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Side effects caused by oral contraceptives discourage compliance with, and continuation of, oral contraceptives. A suggested disadvantage of biphasic compared to triphasic oral contraceptive (OC) pills is an increase in breakthrough bleeding. We conducted this systematic review to examine this potential disadvantage.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare biphasic with triphasic oral contraceptives in terms of efficacy, cycle control, and discontinuation due to side effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 21:21:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE, LILACS and CENTRAL, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and book chapters. We also contacted the authors of relevant studies and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-24 20:06:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials comparing any biphasic with any triphasic OC when used to prevent pregnancy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-24 20:07:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We examined the studies found during the searches for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. We contacted the authors of included studies and of possibly randomized studies for information about the methods and outcomes. We entered the data into RevMan. We calculated Peto odds ratios for incidence of discontinuation due to medical reasons, intermenstrual bleeding, and absence of withdrawal bleeding.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-20 18:51:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Only two trials of limited quality met our inclusion criteria. One study compared two biphasic pills and one triphasic pill, each containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. No important differences emerged, and the frequency of discontinuation due to medical problems was similar with all three pills. The other trial compared a biphasic pill containing norethindrone (Ortho 10/11) with a triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel (Triphasil) and with another triphasic containing norethindrone (Ortho 7/7/7). The biphasic pill had inferior cycle control compared with the levonorgestrel triphasic. The odds ratio of cycles with intermenstrual bleeding was 1.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 2.24) for the biphasic compared with the triphasic levonorgestrel pill. The odds ratio of cycles without withdrawal bleeding was 6.48 (95% CI 3.13 to 13.39). In contrast, cycle control with the biphasic pill was comparable to that of the triphasic containing the same progestin (norethindrone).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The available evidence is limited and the internal validity of these trials is questionable. Given the high losses to follow up, these reports may even be considered observational. Given that caveat, the biphasic pill containing norethindrone was associated with inferior cycle control compared with the triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel. The choice of progestin may be more important than the phasic regimen in determining bleeding patterns.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 21:52:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Side effects caused by oral contraceptives discourage compliance with, and continuation of, oral contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Hillard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillard 1992</LINK>). Three approaches have been used to decrease these adverse effects: reduction of the steroid dose, development of new steroids, and new formulas and schedules of administration. The third strategy led to the development of both biphasic and triphasic pills.</P>
<P>Biphasic and triphasic oral contraceptives purportedly attempt to 'mimic' the rising and falling pattern of estrogen and progesterone as seen during the normal menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Upton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upton 1983</LINK>). The biphasic pill soon yielded to the triphasic pill because of a suggested increase in breakthrough bleeding associated with the use of the biphasic oral contraceptive pill (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 1991</LINK>). We conducted this systematic review to examine this potential disadvantage of biphasic oral contraceptives as compared with triphasic pills.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare biphasic with triphasic oral contraceptive pills. Our a priori hypotheses were that biphasic and triphasic pills have similar contraceptive efficacy but that triphasic oral contraceptives cause fewer side effects, give better cycle control, and have higher continuation rates.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-20 18:52:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>For the initial review, two authors evaluated the titles and abstracts found during the literature searches, and all potentially relevant articles were photocopied. We had one French article (<LINK REF="STD-Castaigne-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Castaigne 1985</LINK>) translated into English. Then two authors independently examined the retrieved studies for possible inclusion. For the updates, one author reviewed the search results and identified reports for inclusion or exclusion. A second author also examined any reports identified for appropriate categorization.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-10-20 18:53:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>After inclusion of a study, two authors abstracted the data. There was no disagreement about the inclusion of studies or abstracted data. We wrote a letter to the authors of the two included studies and asked for additional information about the methodology of the study and the various outcome measures. One author then entered the abstracted data into RevMan 3.1, and later imported the review into RevMan 4.1. Another author verified that the data had been correctly entered.</P>

<P>Neither study (<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>) adequately described the method of randomization and allocation concealment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>) sponsored by Parke-Davis reportedly kept investigators blinded as to treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK> provided an a priori hypothesis and a sample size calculation. <LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK> did not report an a priori hypothesis or a sample size or power calculation. We received supplemental information from <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK> but not from <LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>.</P>
<P>Both trials had high losses after randomization. Of the 458 women who participated in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>), 252 women discontinued. Losses to follow-up ranged from 40% to 54% in the three treatment arms. In <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>, 169 out of 469 women participating withdrew during the first six months. Seventy-eight women dropped out before or during the first cycle of pill use. This raises the strong possibility of selection bias in both studies.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-10-20 18:37:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We could not aggregate the clinical outcomes of the included studies because they examined different kinds of pills (<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>). Moreover, even if they had examined the same pills, we would not choose to aggregate two studies of poor methodological quality.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK> examined 1269 user cycles of biphasic preparation Alpha, 1163 user cycles of biphasic preparation Beta, and 1154 user cycles of triphasic preparation Gamma. No pregnancies occurred during the study period. Life-table continuation rates after 12 cycles were lower with the triphasic Gamma pill (40%) than with Alpha (50%) or Beta (44%) pills. The discontinuation rates for medical reasons did not differ significantly among the three preparations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Patterns of breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and absence of withdrawal bleeding are impossible to interpret because of insufficient detail.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK> examined 533 user cycles of a biphasic Ortho 10/11, 506 cycles of Triphasil, and 524 cycles of the triphasic Ortho 7/7/7. In the comparison between Ortho 10/11 and Triphasil, the biphasic pill (Ortho 10/11) was associated with significantly more cycles with intermenstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>: OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.24). Similarly, cycles without a withdrawal bleed were significantly more common with the biphasic pill (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>: OR 6.48; 95% CI 3.13 to 13.39). However, rates of study discontinuation due to intermenstrual bleeding were similar for both groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the comparison between Ortho 10/11 and Ortho 7/7/7, the preparations had similar frequencies for cycles with intermenstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). The proportions of cycles without withdrawal bleeding were also comparable (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). Finally, the proportion of women who discontinued the study because of intermenstrual bleeding was the same in both groups (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We identified only two randomized controlled trials comparing a biphasic with a triphasic regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>). The reports do not describe the method of randomization and the use (if any) of allocation concealment. Both studies examined a modest number of user cycles. More importantly, a large proportion of women in both trials were lost to follow up after randomization. Because of the large losses after randomization, these data may be more appropriately considered observational, and the internal validity of these trials is questionable. Because of small sample sizes, we were unable to address our a priori hypothesis concerning contraceptive efficacy. However, we found some support for our hypothesis of better cycle control with at least one triphasic regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>An earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Larranaga-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larranaga 1978</LINK>) contributed little information. However, it showed no important differences among the three pills studied. A later trial (<LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>) found that the biphasic pill (Ortho 10/11) caused significantly more cycles with intermenstrual bleeding or no withdrawal bleeding than did one triphasic pill (Triphasil). This difference was not seen when the biphasic pill was compared with a triphasic pill (Ortho 7/7/7) containing the same progestin (norethindrone). </P>
<P>Other randomized controlled trials have found that triphasic pills containing levonorgestrel provide better cycle control than do those containing norethindrone. One trial comparing two norethindrone-containing triphasic pills versus a levonorgestrel-containing triphasic pill (<LINK REF="REF-Droegemueller-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droegemueller 1989</LINK>) found that levonorgestrel was associated with the lowest frequency of intermenstrual bleeding. Another trial comparing these three triphasic formulations (<LINK REF="REF-Schilling-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schilling 1989</LINK>) corroborated this observation. Thus, the poorer cycle control with the biphasic pill (Ortho 10/11) versus Triphasil in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Percival_x002d_Smith-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Percival-Smith 1990</LINK>) may reflect the progestin used (norethindrone) rather than the phasic formulation itself. Levonorgestrel has a greater bioavailability, longer serum half-life, and greater relative binding affinity in humans than does norethindrone (<LINK REF="REF-Wallach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallach 2000</LINK>). These features may translate into better control of menstrual bleeding.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>One study found that a biphasic pill containing norethindrone (Ortho 10/11) provided inferior cycle control to a triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel (Triphasil). Aside from this, clinicians have limited information to distinguish between biphasic and triphasic pills.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the infrequent use of biphasic pills in most of the world, further comparative trials do not appear justified.</P>
