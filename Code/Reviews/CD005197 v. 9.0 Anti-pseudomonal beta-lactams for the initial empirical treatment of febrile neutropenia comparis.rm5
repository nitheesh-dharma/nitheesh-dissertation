<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-29 10:05:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer patients develop neutropenia, a decrease in the neutrophil subset of the white blood cells, as a result of chemotherapy. Neutropenia exposes patients to infections, mainly bacterial. Without antibiotic treatment these infections may be fatal, therefore antibiotic treatment is administered when a patient with neutropenia develops fever. The objective of this review was to compare antibiotic treatments currently recommended in consensus guidelines for the initial treatment of cancer patients with fever and neutropenia.</P>
<P>We identified 44 studies comparing different antibiotics. Cefepime resulted in significantly higher mortality compared to all other antibiotics combined, at the end of patients' hospital stay or 30 days after entry into the study. The risk was 39% higher with cefepime, ranging from 4 to 86% increased risk. We did not find an explanation for this when looking into other outcomes reported in the primary studies. Piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in lower mortality than other antibiotics. The other antibiotics (ceftazidime, imipenem and meropenem) showed comparable efficacy, with a lower rate of antibiotic changes for imipenem or meropenem and a higher rate of severe diarrhea with these two antibiotics.</P>
<P>We conclude that piperacillin-tazobactam might be the preferred antibiotic for the treatment of cancer patients with fever and neutropenia and that cefepime should not be used. Antibiotic selection (other than cefepime) depends on the individual patient and the type of bacteria prevalent in the specific hospital.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antipseudomonal beta-lactam to another antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic, both given alone or with the addition of the same glycopeptide to both study arms, for the initial treatment of fever and neutropenia among cancer patients.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-29 10:34:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors applied inclusion criteria and extracted the data independently. Missing data were sought. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled using the fixed effect model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using a domain-based evaluation and its effect of results was assessed through sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-29 10:34:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-four trials were included. The antibiotics assessed were cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem. Adequate allocation concealment and generation were reported in about half of the trials and only two trials were double-blinded. The risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher with cefepime compared to other beta-lactams (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.86, 21 trials, 3471 participants), without heterogeneity and with higher RRs in trials at low risk for bias. There were no differences in secondary outcomes but for a non-significantly higher rate of bacterial superinfections with cefepime. Mortality was significantly lower with piperacillin-tazobactam compared to other antibiotics (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92, 8 trials, 1314 participants), without heterogeneity. Carbapenems resulted in similar all-cause mortality and a lower rate of clinical failure and antibiotic modifications as compared to other antibiotics, but a higher rate of diarrhea caused by <I>Clostridium difficile</I>.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-29 10:04:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence supports the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in locations where antibiotic resistance profiles do not mandate empirical use of carbapenems. Carbapenems result in a higher rate of antibiotic-associated and <I>Clostridium difficile</I>-associated diarrhea. There is a high level of evidence that all-cause mortality is higher with cefepime compared to other beta-lactams and it should not be used as monotherapy for patients with febrile neutropenia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 13:38:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Neutropenia is defined as a reduction of the neutrophil count below 500/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. Chemotherapy is the major cause among cancer patients. Other causes include radiation therapy and bone marrow involvement by the primary tumour (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 2000</LINK>). Susceptibility to infections increases as the neutrophil count decreases below 1000 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. Very low counts (below 100 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>) and longer duration of neutropenia increase the risk (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1944</LINK>). Other deficits in the immune response, breaks in skin and mucosa, indwelling catheters, and invasive procedures further increase patients' susceptibility to infection (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fever develops in 57% to 94% of patients in different studies during an episode of neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Engels-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 1998</LINK>) with a rate of 20 to 40 fever-days per 100 days with neutrophil count below 500/mm<SUP>3</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Storring-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storring 1977</LINK>). Infection is documented in 56% (24 to 94%) of patients with fever and neutropenia, while bacteraemia is documented in 24% (4% to 57%, <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2004</LINK>). Short-term mortality for bacteraemia with neutropenia ranges between 8% in randomised trials to 23% in observational series (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Velasco-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velasco 2003</LINK>). Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment may halve overall mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leibovici-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovici 1998</LINK>). The ability of clinicians to predict infection in febrile neutropenic patients is low (sensitivity 70%, specificity 62% in one study, <LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1984</LINK>), and thus all febrile neutropenic patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.</P>
<P>The microbiological etiology of an infection in the neutropenic patient depends on underlying disease and type of chemotherapy, extent of the patient's exposure to the healthcare environment, use of prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics, duration of neutropenia, and other factors. In general, the rate of Gram-positive infections has been increasing throughout the last three decades, probably in relation to the extensive use of long-term intravascular catheter (<LINK REF="REF-De_x002d_bock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De-bock 2001</LINK>). Centers in the US, Italy and in the MASCC cohorts (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) report a predominance of Gram-positive bacteremia (<LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raad 2007</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Tumbarello-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tumbarello 2009</LINK> ). However, epidemiology is highly local with some centers, more in the middle east and developing countries, reporting a predominance of Gram-negative bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Baskaran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskaran 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanafani-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanafani 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 13:39:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Beta-lactam monotherapy has been shown to be as effective and potentially safer than combination therapy consisting of a beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2004</LINK>). Management guidelines from various societies endorse monotherapy for patients in need for intravenous antibiotic treatment, with or without the addition of a glycopeptide (<LINK REF="REF-ECIL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECIL 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Link-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Link 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamura-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamura 2005</LINK>). The guidelines recommend that "a third or fourth-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) or a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem) may be used successfully as monotherapy" and that "piperacillin-tazobactam has also been found to be effective as monotherapy, but its use has not been studied as extensively as that of the other agents".</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-09-25 09:50:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Beta-lactams differ somewhat in their antibacterial spectrum of activity. Cefepime and ceftazidime are advanced oxymino-cephalosporins. Cefepime offers, in-vitro, a broader spectrum than ceftazidime, with enhanced activity against Gram-positive (methicillin-sensitive <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>) and Gram-negative bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Fritsche-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fritsche 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfaller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfaller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1993</LINK>). The major defence mechanism of Gram-negative bacteria are beta-lactamases, enzymes capable of cleaving the beta-lactam ring thereby inactivating beta-lactams; cefepime is resistant to some of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) which inactivate ceftazidime (<LINK REF="REF-Jacoby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacoby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1993</LINK>). Piperacillin-tazobactam, a penicillin beta-lactam combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, shows variable in-vitro activity against ESBL-producing bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfaller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfaller 1997</LINK>). However, the activity of both cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam against ESBL-positive Gram-negative bacteria is limited by the inoculum effect, with diminished activity as the size of the bacterial inoculum increases (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacoby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacoby 2005</LINK>). Carbapenems offer a broad spectrum of activity against ESBL-producing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with the exception of methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>. Clinical outcomes with carbepenems are probably superior to those obtained with other beta-lactams for ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Beta-lactams differ also in their propensity to induce resistance. Resistance induction may affect the outcome of the treated infection and/or subsequent infections. The beta-lactams recommended for use in febrile neutropenia are poor inducers of AmpC chromosomal beta-lactamases and are thus active against Gram-negative bacteria with inducible beta-lactamases (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2002</LINK>). Carbapenems, however, and to a lesser extent cefepime, have a lower propensity for selection of resistant (derepressed) mutants, highly resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2002</LINK>). Clinical studies have shown correlations between the use of ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam, and subsequent isolation of broad-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacter spp. (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwaber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwaber 2003</LINK>). Development of resistance during treatment of Enterobacter infections has also been shown with ceftazidime (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaye-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaye 2001</LINK>). Cefepime was advantageous in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Pechere-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pechere 1992</LINK>) and small non-comparative series have suggested a clinical advantage (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1996</LINK>). However, broad-spectrum resistance may be selected in-vitro also with cefepime and involves selection of mutants with altered permeability conferring resistance to other antibiotic classes (<LINK REF="REF-Fung_x002d_Tomc-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung-Tomc 1996</LINK>) Clinical studies comparing the risk of resistance induction with cefepime versus other broad-spectrum cephalosporins are lacking.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-09-29 05:39:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recommended beta-lactams have been compared in several trials, most commonly comparing a newly introduced antibiotic to an established beta-lactam. No single beta-lactam is currently preferred. Previous meta-analyses targeted specific beta-lactams: ceftazidime (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1991</LINK>), imipenem-cilastatin (<LINK REF="REF-Deaney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deaney 1996</LINK>), and ceftriaxone (<LINK REF="REF-Furno-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furno 2000</LINK>), and included studies comparing monotherapy to combination therapy. In a previous systematic review we demonstrated increased mortality with cefepime (<LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yahav-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yahav 2007</LINK>), a finding that was refuted by a subsequent analysis conducted by the FDA (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assembled comparative trials assessing anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams administered as single agents (defined as a beta-lactam without an aminoglycoside) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients to assess whether there is an advantage to one of the recommended beta-lactams and to clarify the uncertainty regarding cefepime for this indication.</P>

The glycopeptide antibiotic (vancomycin, or teicoplanin) must have been added to both trial arms using the same dose, schedule and timing of administration for inclusion. We excluded interventions where an aminoglycoside was added to the beta-lactam. Thus, we assessed the beta-lactam monotherapies currently recommended in consensus guidelines for the treatment of febrile neutropenia, for those in need of intravenous treatment, with or without a glycopeptide (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Link-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Link 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamura-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tamura 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ECIL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECIL 2009</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-10-05 12:56:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Two reviewers assessed risk of bias of each study, independently (MP, AB or DY). We used domain-based evaluation, examining the following domains: allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data for the outcomes of mortality and clinical failure with the number of patients excluded from outcome assessment and inclusion of patients more than once in the trial (listed under "other bias"). Each item was scored as yes or no, for low or high risk for bias, respectively. Where data/ outcome were not reported or details were not clear the item was scored as unclear.</P>
<P>Mortality and clinical failure were extracted preferentially by intention to treat, including all individuals randomised in the outcome assessment. Where not possible, data as treated (per protocol) were extracted. We scored trials in which the number of patients evaluated was lower than the number of patients randomized as high risk for bias for incomplete outcome data assessment, regarding attrition and exclusions similarly. This domain was scored as unclear if the outcome was not reported or if the number of randomized patients was not provided.</P>
<P>For blinding, only double-blinded trials (blinding of patient and carer) were scored as low risk. Trials recruiting patients more than once into the trial (randomizing and evaluating episodes rather than patients) were scored as high risk for bias.</P>

<P>Trials of febrile neutropenia frequently randomise febrile episodes instead of patients, without adjusting for intra-patient correlations.

<P>Forty-four trials were included comparing one antipseudomonal beta-lactam to another, without or without a glycopeptide, among neutropenic cancer patients. These are described in the characteristics of included studies tables. The studies were conducted between 1985 to 2009 (year study ended), published between 1988 to 2010 and conducted worldwide. Notably, 14 were conducted in the US (year end 1985 to 2001) and 7 in Turkey (year end 1998 to 2009). Forteen were multicenter studies, while all others were conducted in a single hospital. Thirty-seven trials were published in full, four as conference proceedings (<LINK REF="STD-Bickers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bickers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cornely-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cornely 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oppenheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oppenheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shichmanter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shichmanter 2004</LINK>) and three were identified in the new drug applications of cefepime to the FDA (<LINK REF="STD-Aoun-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aoun 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramphal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramphal 1996</LINK>). No new trials were identified in the FDA analysis of cefepime (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The comparisons performed are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. The most frequent comparison was between cefepime and ceftazidime (nine trials). Only one trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam versus ceftazidime. Missing from the figure are six comparisons, each performed in a single trial: cefepime versus an unspecific carbapenem (<LINK REF="STD-Tamura-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tamura 2002</LINK>) or panipenem (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2008</LINK>), ceftazidime versus ticarcillin-clavulanate (<LINK REF="STD-Bodey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bodey 1990</LINK>) or piperacillin (<LINK REF="STD-Anaissie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Anaissie 1988</LINK>) and imipenem versus aztreonam (<LINK REF="STD-Raad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raad 1996</LINK>) or meropenem (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1996</LINK>).

<LI>Piperacillin-tazobactam versus other</LI>
<LI>Carbapenem versus other</LI>

<P>The median number of included patients was 142 (range 40 to 528), with study size inversely correlated with study years (Spearman's rho p = 0.002, correlation coefficient = -0.49). Eight trials included children alone, two included adults and children and the remaining assessed adults alone. Neutropenia was defined as less than 500/ml<SUP>3 </SUP>in 12 trials, while 28 trials allowed also the inclusion of patients with neutrophil counts &lt;1000/ml<SUP>3 </SUP>that were expected to drop to &lt; 500/ml<SUP>3 </SUP>(three trials did not define neutropenia). The median prevalences of central venous catheter, antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis on study entry were 68% (reported in 27 studies), 28% (reported in 28 studies) and 45% (reported in 12 studies), respectively, all ranging from 0 to 100%. The median percentage of bacteremias caused by Gram-negative bacteria was 39.7% (7.7 to 100%, 26 studies) and the median percentage of bacteria resistant to one of the study drugs was 25% (0 to 59%, 14 studies). None of these clinical data were correlated with the study year.</P>
<P>All-cause mortality was reported in 37/44 trials, the rate of superinfections in 19 and duration of hospital stay in six. All trials reported on clinical failure (the primary outcome in all trials), defined as no improvement, deterioration, or need for antibiotic modifications, where need for modifications was the predominant reason for failure assignment. The timing for reporting of mortality was fixed (e.g. 30 days post inclusion) in six trials; in 25 trials the time point was stated but not fixed (e.g. end of treatment, 7 days after end of treatment, in-hospital, etc) and in 13 it was not stated. Data for duration of hospital stay were infrequently and variably reported as means or medians, thus we did not try to pool this outcome. Resistance development was reported in a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Anaissie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Anaissie 1988</LINK>); none of the trials conducted surveillance cultures. Risk ratios for clinical failure were correlated with those for any antibiotic modification; risk ratios for mortality were not correlated with those for clinical failure, microbiological failure or other secondary outcomes (data not shown).</P>

<P>All-cause mortality was significantly higher with cefepime as compared with other antibiotics, RR 1.39 [1.04, 1.86], without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%), 21 trials, 3471 participants <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. The RRs were &gt;1 in the comparisons versus ceftazidime, carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam and statistically significant only overall. To investigate increased mortality we conducted several sensitivity analyses. The differences between cefepime and comparators were higher with adequate allocation concealment (RR 1.74 [1.18, 2.56], <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) and generation (RR 1.79 [1.22, 2.64], <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), with blinding of outcome assessors or double-blinding (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and with intention to treat analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), as compared to unclear or higher risk for bias for these categories. RRs were higher in published data and published studies as compared with unpublished data (unpublished studies or data obtained through correspondence with authors) or unpublished studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Mortality was significantly higher with cefepime in adequately concealed trials when used in the recommended daily dose (4gr/day for adults and 150 mg/kg/day for children) and also in trials where lower doses were used regardless of trial's risk of bias (trials were too few for separate analysis), <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>. When re-analysing <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> using risk differences, to include studies with 0 events in both study arms, the result was still statistically significant, risk difference 16.2/1000 episodes [1.7, 30.6], p = 0.028.</P>

When re-analysing the comparison using FDA's data on 30-day mortality for trials included in our analysis (15 trials) and our data for trials not included in the FDA analysis - 6 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ghalaut-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ghalaut 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutluk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kutluk 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oguz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oguz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shichmanter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shichmanter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2009</LINK>), results were similar to our main analysis (RR 1.37 [1.03, 1.83]), <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.

Clinical failure was not different overall (RR 1.02 [0.95, 1.09], 21 trials, 3028 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis by allocation concealment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>) and subgroup analysis for patients with clinically-documented infections did not reveal new differences. There were no significant differences as regards microbiological failure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>), any modifications to the antibiotic assigned antibiotic (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>) or any superinfection. There were fewer additions of glycopeptides and antifungal drugs with cefepime as compared to carbapenems, but the differences overall were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). The RR for bacterial superinfections was 1.70 [0.94, 3.09] (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). Duration of hospital stay was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kebudi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kebudi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oguz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oguz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uygun-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Uygun 2009</LINK> with no significant differences between trial arms considering all randomized patients.</P>
<P>There were significantly fewer adverse events with cefepime overall, a difference derived mainly from the comparison versus carbapenems (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>), but there was no statistically significant difference in adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity in all analyses.</P>
<P>In summary, cefepime resulted in significantly higher all-cause mortality than comparator antibiotics and no other differences in secondary outcomes. The level of evidence for this finding is high, given the lack of heterogeneity, consistent findings with adequate randomization methods and the FDA's re-analysis using 30-day mortality data for all randomized patients. A higher rate of bacterial superinfections (without statistical significance) was the only possible explanatory finding.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ceftazidime versus other (RR&lt;1 in favour of ceftazidime)</HEADING>
<P>All-cause mortality was not significantly different for ceftazidime versus other antibiotics overall, RR 0.81 [0.59, 1.13], 19 trials, 3335 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). When excluding the comparison with cefepime from the analysis, the RR was 1.10 [0.66, 1.84].</P>
<P>Clinical failure was significantly more common with ceftazidime as compared to carbapanems, RR 1.16 [1.07, 1.26] (21 trials, 4204 participants <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), with moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 38%). Consistently, antibiotic modifications of any kind and the addition of glycopeptides were more frequent with ceftazidime as compared to carbapanems (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). The addition of antifungals was not more frequent with ceftazidime (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>) There were no differences between ceftazidime and other antibiotics overall with these outcomes and no difference compared to all antibiotics with regard to infection-related mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) and microbiological failure (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). There was no significant difference in superinfections overall, with RRs favouring comparator antibiotics (RR 1.20 [0.95, 1.52], <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>), and only few studies reporting bacterial superinfections specifically (<LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>). The analysis of clinical failure was sensitive to randomization methods, with trials of unclear allocation concealment or generation methods showing disadvantage to ceftazidime with significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=65%) and trials describing adequate methods showing a RR near 1 without heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). Single trials comparing ceftazidime to piperacillin (<LINK REF="STD-Anaissie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Anaissie 1988</LINK>) or ticarcillin-clavulanate (<LINK REF="STD-Bodey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bodey 1990</LINK>) were outliers in the analyses of clinical and microbiological failure, showing advantage to ceftazidime, and contributed to heterogeneity in these comparisons. Their exclusion abolished heterogeneity with no change in the results described above. There was no significant heterogeneity in other analyses.</P>
<P>The analysis of any adverse event was highly heterogenous, thus we did not try to compile it (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>). Ceftazidime caused much less adverse events than carbapenems in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Freifeld-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freifeld 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolston-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rolston 1992</LINK>); in both on account of more gastrointestinal events and pseudomembranous colitis with imipenem. Similar results were seen in one trial comparing ceftazidime to piperacillin (<LINK REF="STD-Anaissie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Anaissie 1988</LINK>), where allergic skin reactions also contributed to the difference. Tha analysis of adverse events requiring discontinuation was not heterogenous and showed a non-significant advantage to ceftazidime, RR 0.69 [0.47, 1.03] (<LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, there was no difference between ceftazidime and comparator drugs in all-cause mortality, except for cefepime. More clinical failures occurred with ceftazidime compared to carbapenems, on account of antibiotic modifications, but this analysis was sensitive to randomization methods and with adequate randomization methods no difference was observed. There were fewer adverse events with ceftazidime, mainly diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis when compared to imipenem.</P>

The difference was statistically significant also in the comparison restricted to carbapenems, RR 0.46 [0.22, 0.95]. RRs were similar in adequately concealed trials and in those where allocation concealment methods were unclear (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). The risk difference, including one trial with no deaths was, -26.9/1000 episodes [- 4.4, - 49.5], p = 0.02. There was no heterogeneity in these analyses (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference with regard to infection-related mortality, RR 0.62 [0.29, 1.34] (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). There was no significant difference in clinical failure overall, with a statistically non-significance advantage to piperacillin -tazobactam when compared to cefepime, 0.89 [0.79, 1.01], <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>, and this analysis was not sensitive to the methods of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>).

No trials reported on superinfections.</P>
<P>There were significantly fewer adverse events with piperacillin-tazobactam in an analysis including three trials comparing it to imipenem and one trial comparing it to cefepime, with some heterogeneity, RR 0.39 [0.24, 0.65], I<SUP>2</SUP>=12% (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). Adverse events requiring discontinuation occurred in one trial only; the compiled risk difference for discontinuations including no events trials was -0.1/1000 participants [-15.9, +14.9], 5 trials, 636 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in lower all-cause mortality, compared mainly to cefepime and carbapanems. A benefit was observed also with regard to adverse events. The level of evidence for this finding is moderate because most trials had unclear allocation concealment.</P>

The analyses of glycopeptide and antifungal drug additions were heterogenous and thus not compiled. Antifungals drugs were added more to the carbapenem arm in all comparisons except for that with piperacillin-tazobactam; when excluding the comparison with piperacillin-tazobactam there was a significant advantage to comparator antibiotics, RR 1.29 [1.03, 1.61] (<LINK REF="CMP-004.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.9</LINK>).

The overall analysis was significantly heterogenous and thus not compiled. There was a higher rate of seizures with imipenem compared to other antibiotics, RR 3.18 [1.10, 9.18] (<LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>), a higher rate of pseudomembranous colitis for carbapenems versus cephalosporins, 1.94 [1.24, 3.04] (<LINK REF="CMP-004.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.16</LINK>) and a higher rate of other gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhea and vomiting overall, 2.00 [1.63, 2.46] (<LINK REF="CMP-004.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.17</LINK>), with significant heterogeneity. The latter comparison was heterogenous (I<SUP>2</SUP>=68%); the definitions for other gastrointestinal events were heterogenous, but most trials showed varying degrees of advantage to comparator drugs. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported in fewer trials and there was no significant difference between carbapenems and other antibiotics (<LINK REF="CMP-004.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, carbapenems showed similar all-cause mortality and a lower rate of clinical failure and antibiotic modifications as compared to other antibiotics.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-05 14:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>We compiled trials comparing different antipseudomonal beta-lactams administered as single agents, with or without the addition of a glycopeptide, in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. The most significant finding of this review is that cefepime resulted in higher all-cause mortality at 30 days and end of follow-up when compared to carbapenems, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam. This finding was robust to several sensitivity analyses, consistently more pronounced in trials with lower risk of bias, resulting in a high level of evidence. The reasons for increased mortality were not apparent in the analysis of secondary outcomes; we did not find a disadvantage to cefepime as regards clinical failure, microbiological eradication of infection or adverse events. There were non-significantly more bacterial superinfections with cefepime. The other finding was lower all-cause mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam compared to other beta-lactams, with a moderate level of evidence. Carbapenems were associated with a lower rate of clinical failure and antibiotic modifications than the other antibiotics, but caused significantly more adverse events, mainly diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, which may be significant problems in cancer patients (low level of evidence). Imipenem caused a significantly higher rate of seizures.</P>
<P>In all but two trials carers were not blinded to the assigned antibiotic regimen. Thus, the outcome of clinical failure should be viewed with caution. Defined by current guidelines as no response or need for antibiotic modification (<LINK REF="REF-Feld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feld 2002</LINK>), it consists mainly of antibiotic modifications (addition of a glycopeptide, aminoglycoside, antifungal drug or beta-lactam switch). Antibiotic modifications are naturally prone to bias in trials comparing a novel antibiotic to a commonly used antibiotic. In addition, this composite outcome comprises many possible complications, including the mere continuation of fever that is very common among neutropenic cancer patients as long as neutropenia persists, true failure of the treatment, a new bacterial superinfection or a new fungal infections that carries ominous consequences. On the other hand, it is difficult to define clinical failure differently, disregarding antibiotic modifications, since ultimately a patient either resolves the infection without or without antibiotic modifications or dies. In all analyses, results for all-cause mortality were not correlated with clinical failure, reported as primary outcome in all trials. Our interpretation is that the outcomes relevant in the assessment of treatment for febrile neutropenia are all-cause mortality, hospital stay, bacterial and fungal superinfections defined with commonly accepted criteria for healthcare associated infections (<LINK REF="REF-CDC_x002f_NHSN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC/NHSN 2008</LINK> or fungal infections (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 2008</LINK>), respectively, and adverse events, mainly <I>Clostridium-difficile</I>-associated colitis. Basing the conclusions of our review on these outcomes, cefepime should not be used for the treatment of neutropenic cancer patients due to higher mortality, piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftazidime (in this order) are the preferred beta-lactams and carbapenems should be reserved for cases where baseline resistance rates prohibit the use of piperacillin-tazobactam, due to a higher rate of adverse events.</P>
<P>Since the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yahav-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yahav 2007</LINK>) and because of its results, the FDA has conducted a review on the safety of cefepime (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>). This analysis included both neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. They concluded that "no statistically significant increase in mortality was seen in cefepime-treated patients compared to comparator-treated patients... and,... Based on the results of FDA's meta-analyses, the FDA has determined that cefepime remains an appropriate therapy for its approved indications". Notably, cefepime is the only FDA-approved monotherapy for febrile neutropenia. TheFDA's analysis was highly transparent, its results are openly available to the public on the web (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2009</LINK>) and all our questions regarding this investigation were duly answered by the medical officer. However, we have several concerns with the results of this analysis. The analysis was dependent on data provided by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), the producer of cefepime. BMS supplied previously unpublished trials and complemented mortality data that were previous unavailable in published trials. Unfortunately, the FDA did not attempt to corroborate the data supplied by BMS through correspondence with the academic researchers involved in the unpublished trials and could not obtain data on the trial methods substantiating a randomized design for the new trials that BMS supplied. The FDA's analysis includes 30 unpublished trials, where BMS declared that "All the non proprietary data available from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) on cefepime is currently available in the published literature" in correspondence with us at the time we conducted the original review and asked the company for additional data (personal correspondence, available upon request from the authors). In published trials (including complementary data on mortality supplied by authors or BMS) mortality was significantly higher with cefepime, RR 1.26 [1.08, 1.46]. In new trials, previously unavailable to the FDA nor published in conference proceedings or elsewhere, mortality was significantly lower with cefepime, RR 0.77 [0.61, 0.98] (<LINK REF="REF-Leibovici-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovici 2010</LINK>). The combined results showing that cefepime is not associated with higher mortality is suspect.</P>
<P>The FDA's analysis of cefepime for febrile neutropenia, was based on a meta-analysis of trials including cefepime versus any other antibiotic, with or without an aminoglycoside in one or both study arms (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2009</LINK>) and showed no statistically significant difference for cefepime versus comparators (risk difference 9.67/1000 episodes [-2.87, 22.21]) (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>). Thus, cefepime was approved for its indication of monotherapy for febrile neutropenia based on an analysis that included trials assessing it in combination with aminoglycosides. The current analysis of monotherapy trials only, including FDA's data on 30-day mortality by intention to treat, shows higher mortality with cefepime (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The FDA entitled their study "meta-analysis of a possible signal of increased mortality associated with cefepime use". It should be noted that association is inferred from observational studies; randomized controlled trials can establish causality. The level of evidence for this finding is high, because it is based on the results of randomized controlled trials; there is no inconsistency in results; the evidence directly answers thehealthcarequestion we posed; publication bias is unlikely given our systematic search and the FDA's analysis of the sponsor's trials; and a dose-response relationship was observed (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reasons for increased mortality with cefepime remain unexplained. The FDA conducted a patient-level analysis of a set of trials selected by the sponsor. There were no significant differences in baseline patient characteristics explaining the increased mortality among patients assigned to cefepime, but comparative clinical data relevant to cancer patients was missing (malignancy status unknown in 87% of the febrile neutropenia trials). A detailed assessment of the circumstances leading to death in seven febrile neutropenia trials failed to identify a common cause. However, It is very difficult to identify the cause for death in cancer patients with fever and neutropenia retrospectively (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1992</LINK>). Recent reports have described non-convulsive status epilepticus among patients treated with cefepime, mainly among patients with impaired renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Lichaa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichaa 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-Herrera-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin Herrera 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaheen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaheen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thabet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thabet 2009</LINK>). A recent study showed that free drug concentrations above MIC of cefepime are required <U>&gt;</U>60% of time for microbiological cure of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infections that are prevalent among neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Crandon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crandon 2010</LINK>). The authors stated that cefepime doses of at least 2 g every 8 h are required to achieve this target against susceptible <I>P. aeruginosa</I> organisms in patients with normal renal function. In another study, conventional dose and intermittent administration of cefepime at 2gr twice daily achieved only 54% and 28% of the target drug concentrations against <I>P. aeruginosa </I>and <I>Acinetobacter baumannii</I>, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Roos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos 2006</LINK>)<I>. </I>Thus, two explanations for the increased mortality may exist; inadequate dosing/ administration schedule or an adverse event that was not documented in randomized controlled trials. However, the most likely cause for increased mortality among patients with febrile neutropenia is lack of antibacterial efficacy and our ability to assess this outcome is limited.</P>

<P>The decision of the beta-lactam used for the treatment of febrile neutropenia is dependent on local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns in the ward or hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Rolston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolston 2006</LINK>). Our review provides evidence on the comparative efficacy and toxicity of the available beta-lactams when administered in a given epidemiological setting. Based on this review, cefepime should not be used for patients with febrile neutropenia. Piperacillin-tazobactam should be the preferred beta-lactam for use as single agent, with or without a glycopeptide, in settings where resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to piperacillin-tazobactam is not prevalent (lower than 25%). Ceftazidime, imipenem and meropenem can be used, considering that the carbapenems are associated with a higher rate of antibiotic-associated and <I>Clostridium difficile</I>-associated diarrhea. The decision whether to used a lower-spectrum beta-lactam (with or without an antipseudomonal spectrum of coverage) combined with an aminoglycoside to increase the spectrum of coverage or to select a broader-spectrum beta-lactam alone is difficult. Evidence shows that mortality is lower with the broader-spectrum beta-lactam and nephrotoxicity is significantly higher with combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-29 10:24:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials assessing antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia should report outcomes that are important to the individual patient and for decision making. All cause mortality should be reported by intention to treat in all trials and also as-treated in non-inferiority trials (<LINK REF="REF-Piaggio-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piaggio 2006</LINK>). Clinical failure, as currently defined, is not an appropriate surrogate outcome since it does not portend different in all-cause mortality. Patients should be included only once in the trial or results reported for patients' first randomization, since analyses relying on episodes are incorrect. The outcomes of bacterial and fungal superinfections should be defined using established and replicable definitions. While definitions for fungal infections have been specifically devised (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 2008</LINK>), definitions for other infections, including catheter-related infections, have not been defined specifically for neutropenic patients. We suggest that the CDC/NHSN definitions for healthcare associated infections be used (<LINK REF="REF-CDC_x002f_NHSN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC/NHSN 2008</LINK>). Length of hospital stay is a highly relevant outcome to the individual patient and should be reported.</P>
<P>All randomized trials conducted should be registered in accessible trial registries and their results should be made publicly available if not published, to avoid situations such the one described herein for cefepime. As for cefepime, full data on trial methods, trial locations, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics and outcomes for the unpublished trials included in the FDA's analysis should be reported. Given the alternative antibiotics currently available, we see no further need or justification for trials assessing its efficacy/ safety among neutropenic cancer patient.</P>

<P>Double-blind randomised controlled trial conducted as a formulary feasibility study in Canada. 150 patients prescribed imipenem, with or without other medications, meeting inclusion criteria were randomised to imipenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam.
