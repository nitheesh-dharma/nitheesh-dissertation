<P>Whilst melanoma accounts for only 5% of skin cancers, it is important because it is the cause of 75% of all skin cancer deaths. For primary cutaneous melanoma, standard treatment is complete surgical removal of the melanoma with a safety margin some distance from the visible edges of the primary tumour. The purpose of the safety margin is to remove both the primary tumour and any melanoma cells that might have spread into the surrounding skin. However, the optimal width of the safety (excision) margin remains unclear.</P>
<P>This systematic review summarises the evidence about how much tissue (safety margin) should be removed for primary cutaneous melanoma (skin cancer). Excision margins are important because there could be a trade-off between a better cosmetic result but poorer long-term survival if excision margins become too narrow.</P>
<P>It is important to note that for the purposes of this review we consider only invasive melanoma - that has invaded into the deeper layer of the skin (dermis) - and not melanoma-in-situ where the melanoma cells are confined to the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis).</P>
<P>We found five published randomised trials, none of which showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival for patients who had either narrow or wide removal of the melanoma and surrounding tissue.  Similarly, our meta-analysis showed there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups treated with either narrow or wide excision. </P>
<P>The summary estimate for overall survival favoured wide excision by a small degree, but the result was not significantly different. This result is compatible with both a 5% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring narrower excision and a 15% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring wider excision.<I> </I>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:59:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>In August 2009 we searched for relevant randomised trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and other databases including Ongoing Trials Registers.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:59:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical excision of melanoma comparing different width excision margins.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 12:09:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We identified five trials. There were 1633 participants in the narrow excision margin group and 1664 in the wide excision margin group. Narrow margin definition ranged from 1 to 2 cm; wide margins ranged from 3 to 5 cm. Median follow-up ranged from 5 to 16 years.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 13:22:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>This systematic review summarises the evidence regarding width of excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma. None of the five published trials, nor our meta-analysis, showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival between narrow or wide excision.</P>
<P>The summary estimate for overall survival favoured wide excision by a small degree [Hazard Ratio 1.04; 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.15; P = 0.40], but the result was not significantly different. This result is compatible with both a 5% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring narrower excision and a 15% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring wider excision. Therefore, a small (but potentially important) difference in overall survival between wide and narrow excision margins cannot be confidently ruled out.</P>
<P>The summary estimate for recurrence free survival favoured wide excision [Hazard Ratio 1.13; P = 0.06; 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.28] but again the result did not reach statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05 level).</P>
<P>Current randomised trial evidence is insufficient to address optimal excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 13:24:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 13:50:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 13:35:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Melanoma or cutaneous melanoma, is a malignant neoplasm (cancer) arising from uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. It is a significant public health problem because it accounts for only 5% of total skin cancers but 75% of skin cancer deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Boring-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boring 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, melanoma causes disproportionate mortality in people of young and middle age, such that an average of almost 20 years of potential life are lost for each melanoma death in the US, one of the highest rates for adult-onset cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Statistics-Review" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Statistics Review</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>The incidence of melanoma is increasing annually (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>). Approximately 2% (1 in 55) of people born in the US today are expected to develop melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute</LINK>) compared to 1 in 1500 in the 1930s (<LINK REF="REF-Rigel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigel 2000</LINK>). Survival due to melanoma has been improving mainly due to earlier detection (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>), and currently ranges from 67% for black men to 93% for white women in the US (<LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2000 the world incidence of melanoma was 132,602 with 37,047 deaths (28%). The US estimate for 2008, is that 62,480 people will be diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma with 8,420 deaths (13%) (<LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute</LINK>).</P>
<P>Melanoma can develop either in a pre-existing pigmented lesion or de novo (from new) in previously normal looking skin. Features raising suspicion of melanoma in a pre-existing pigmented lesion include: change in size, irregular shape, irregular colour, diameter 7 mm or more, inflammation, oozing, and change in sensation (<LINK REF="REF-MacKie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacKie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKie 1990</LINK>). The ABCD system of diagnosis (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variegation, and a Diameter greater than 6 mm) has also been advocated to assist early clinical diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1985</LINK>), to which 'E' (Evolving or Elevation) has been added (<LINK REF="REF-Abbasi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbasi 2004</LINK>). Epiluminescence microscopy (microscopic examination of the skin surface; dermoscopy) is sometimes used to improve diagnostic accuracy of pigmented lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Argenziano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argenziano 2003</LINK>). Suspicious lesions which have been biopsied should be excised completely and sent for confirmatory histopathological examination (<LINK REF="REF-ANZ-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZ Guidelines 2008</LINK>). In situations where complete removal is not practical (for example, large site, difficult location), an initial incisional biopsy of the lesion should be considered. However, biopsy that does not assess the full thickness of the lesion (for example, superficial shave biopsy) should be avoided because histological thickness of invasion is the basic criterion for staging (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Once melanoma is diagnosed clinically, the stage of the tumour is determined by pathological assessment. Tumour staging is important for treatment. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2009a</LINK>) is recommended for general use in melanoma staging. In the AJCC system stage 0 (in-situ melanoma), stage I, and stage II are defined as localised melanoma, that is, the melanoma is localised to the skin and there is no regional or distant metastatic disease. Stage III melanoma occurs when there is regional metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2009a</LINK>). Stage IV melanoma occurs when there is distant metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eighty one percent of cases of cutaneous melanoma are diagnosed while the cancer is still confined to the primary site (localised stage); 12% are diagnosed after the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes or directly beyond the primary site; 4% are diagnosed after the cancer has already metastasised to distant sites (distant stage), and for the remaining 4% the staging information was unknown. The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates were: 98.7% for localised; 65.1% for regional; 15.5% for distant; and 77.4% for unstaged (<LINK REF="REF-National-Cancer-Institute" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Cancer Institute</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, we are concerned only with primary cutaneous melanoma (Stage I and II melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2009a</LINK>)) which is confined to the skin and in which there is no clinical or histological evidence of metastatic disease. We will not consider or include melanoma that has spread or metastasised. In-situ melanoma (Stage 0), including lentigo maligna, is a distinct topic which will not be considered within this review. In in-situ melanoma, the malignant cells are solely confined to the epidermis and there is no invasion.</P>
<P>The Breslow thickness of a cutaneous melanoma is defined as the distance of invasion, as measured from the granular layer of the epidermis to the point of deepest invasion by the tumour cells (basically the depth or thickness of the melanoma, usually reported in millimetres). This is the most important prognostic indicator of localised disease (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2004</LINK>). Once metastasis has been shown to have occurred, then this (metastasis) becomes the most important prognostic indicator (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2004</LINK>). A thin melanoma with positive nodes has a worse prognosis than a thicker melanoma without them.</P>
<P>The average Breslow thickness of melanoma at the time of diagnosis has been decreasing in recent decades (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garbe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbe 2001</LINK>). This may be related to screening, and earlier presentation and detection of melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Osborne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborne 2002</LINK>). Melanoma mortality has been increasing less rapidly than melanoma incidence, and localised melanoma accounts for an increasing proportion of incident cases.</P>
<P>The development of melanoma is associated with sun exposure, including intense intermittent solar exposure during childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naldi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naldi 2000</LINK>). Melanoma risk has been shown to vary inversely with skin pigmentation, with the incidence rate in African Americans only one sixth of the rate found in the white-skinned population (<LINK REF="REF-Garrison-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrison 1996</LINK>). A strong genetic predisposition for developing melanoma has also been observed for some individuals with dysplastic naevus syndrome (atypical mole syndrome) or a family history of melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newton_x002d_Bishop-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton-Bishop 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 13:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma. Standard treatment is surgical excision with a safety margin, with all excised tissue being examined histologically. The purpose of the safety margin is to remove both the primary tumour and any melanoma cells that might have spread from the primary melanoma into the surrounding skin. If the cells have spread no further, and are all included in the safety margin, the operation would be curative. </P>
<P>Current recommendations for melanoma excision margins are based on the maximum Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma (as determined by the initial excision biopsy). In general, wider excision is favoured for tumours with a less favourable prognosis, such as increased Breslow thickness. However, the extent of surgical excision margins that should be used for a given thickness of melanoma and the magnitude of benefit of different margins is unclear.</P>
<P>The depth of excision in usual clinical practice is excision down to but not including the deep fascia (<LINK REF="REF-ANZ-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZ Guidelines 2008</LINK>). However, In facial areas where 'deep fascia' is less clearly defined (for example, on the ear, nose, or eyelid), or other anatomic sites such as over the breast, existing studies provide no clear guidelines for optimal depth.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Following the diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma (stage I, II) routine investigations are not required for asymptomatic individuals (<LINK REF="REF-ANZ-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZ Guidelines 2008</LINK>). Although sentinel node biopsy is an important prognostic tool for melanoma (<LINK REF="REF-Morton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2006</LINK>), there is debate about its therapeutic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Balch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez--2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ANZ-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZ Guidelines 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balch 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the individual's point of view, when faced with a diagnosis of melanoma, the most important consideration is to make sure that it is removed with as much certainty as possible that it is all gone! The size and depth of the excision should therefore err on the side of safety first. However, quality of life after surgery is an important consideration and unnecessary disfigurement should be avoided.</P>

<P>On the basis of the erroneous interpretation of a single histology specimen, Handley first suggested the removal of 2 inches (5 cm) of subcutaneous tissue down to the level of muscle fascia, together with the radical removal of lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Handley-1907" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handley 1907</LINK>). This set the 'rules' for surgical management of primary cutaneous melanoma for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Eedy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eedy 2003</LINK>). However, in 1977 Breslow and Macht questioned the need for wide excision when they reported no adverse events in a small series of people with melanomas &#8804; 0.75 mm who underwent narrow excision (<LINK REF="REF-Breslow-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breslow 1977</LINK>). Since then, the margins for excising primary cutaneous melanoma have been reduced considerably since Handley's initial report of a case of metastatic melanoma in 1907 (<LINK REF="REF-ANZ-Guidelines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZ Guidelines 2008</LINK>).</P>

Although these various guidelines provide some consistent generalisations regarding the width of excision margins, they do offer slightly different advice. Each guideline is based on the 'best' interpretation of the available evidence at the time of guideline publication. Presumably, the variation in published recommendations relates to difficulty in data interpretation.</P>
<P>A few randomised trials have examined the impact of melanoma excision margins on mortality. However, these trials individually have limited power and follow-up. Most of these trials excluded melanoma on the face, and generally did not study melanoma of the digits or subungual (beneath fingernails or toenails) melanomas. It is unclear whether data on truncal lesions can be extrapolated, for example, to facial lesions.</P>
<P>Three systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining excision margins for primary cutaneous melanomas have previously been published (<LINK REF="REF-Lens-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haigh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haigh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lens 2007</LINK>). However, optimum margin size remains unclear.</P>
<P>Wider excision margins may result in additional hospital inpatient stay, more costly procedures such as skin grafting, increased anaesthetic requirements and increased cosmetic disfigurement and can be associated with wound complications and lymphoedema (<LINK REF="REF-Cassileth-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassileth 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 1993</LINK>). Narrower excision margins may result in higher local recurrence rates or higher mortality, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2001</LINK>). Either too narrow or too wide margins may adversely affect quality of life (QOL) or physical or psychological morbidity, contribute to other adverse events, and increase cost to society via either over treatment or recurrence from under treatment. The impact of these risks on individuals and society and the apparently wide range of excision margins in practice compel systematic review.</P>
<P>We performed this Cochrane review to assess the effects of different excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma.</P>

</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:19:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We used hazard ratios (HR) for the primary analysis which summarise the average effect over the duration of follow-up. Actuarial rates were summarised by duration of follow-up, at medium-term (5 year) and long-term (10 year) time points (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, actuarial rates of overall survival and recurrence-free survival at 5 and 10 years).</P>
<P>We extracted all available summary statistics from all reports of the included trials for the outcome measures specified in the protocol. We directly estimated hazard ratios from coefficients of Cox proportional hazards model where available, including those with adjustment for prognostic factors. We then estimated the hazard ratio and the standard error of the log hazard ratio using the following methods (based on those reported by Parmar et al), (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>) listed in order of preference:</P>
<OL>
<LI>HR reported with confidence interval or log-rank P value. Standard error estimated from confidence interval or P value (confidence interval used if both available). This is the preferred method since the hazard ratio is directly extracted and the standard error is estimated very accurately.</LI>
<LI>Adjusted HR reported with confidence interval or Cox Proportional Hazards P value. Standard error estimated from confidence interval or P value (confidence interval used if both available). This will on average give an estimate close to the unadjusted HR, but different studies adjust for different factors, and the choice of adjustment factors could be data-driven leading to bias.</LI>
<LI>Numbers of events reported with log-rank P value. HR estimated from numbers of events, standard error estimated from this estimated HR and P value. This gives a direct estimate of the HR since all events are considered, but may not be close to the actual HR particularly if the hazards are not proportional.</LI>
<LI>Actuarial rates at fixed follow-up and log-rank P value. This gives an estimate of the HR similar to that of method three, but only events up to the fixed follow-up time are considered.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Where several papers were available reporting different summary statistics for a trial, the primary consideration in selecting results to be entered into the meta-analysis was the type of summary data available, in order of preference as described above. We preferred data with longer follow-up.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:57:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We identified five RCTs of surgical excision of primary cutaneous melanoma which compared different width excision margins. These included a total of 1633 participants in the narrow excision margin group, and 1664 in the wide excision margin group, making a total of 3297 participants. The five RCTs were published in 11 separate reports. The RCTs were: BAPS/MSG study (British Association of Plastic Surgeons, Melanoma Study Group) (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2004</LINK>), French study (<LINK REF="STD-Khayat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khayat 2003</LINK>), Intergoup study (<LINK REF="STD-Balch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Balch 2001</LINK>), Swedish study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohn_x002d_Cedermark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cohn-Cedermark 2000</LINK>), and the WHO study (<LINK REF="STD-Cascinelli-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cascinelli 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:54:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>We identified 5 randomised trials, published in 11 reports (1988 to 2004). We have listed, in brief, the characteristics of each study below and describe these in detail in the tableof '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. All trials were multicentre, and four were multinational.</P>
<P>Our initial search strategies located approximately 800 titles, but none of the remaining titles pertained to randomised trials.</P>
<P>The studies differed in eligibility criteria and were clinically heterogeneous in nature, as described below (and listed fully in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). They considered melanomas of different thickness, different tumour sites, and used different widths of excision margin. In all the trials, the participating dermatologist/surgeon measured excision margins clinically. There are no data given in the studies correlating clinical margins with histological margins. In all the trials, pathologists confirmed the diagnosis of melanomas histologically. The definitions of recurrence varied between studies; however, these definitions were not always clearly and precisely stated in the trials. Management of regional nodes also varied between trials.</P>
<P>The results of the Swedish Melanoma Study Group study comparing 2 cm excision margins with 4 cm excision margins for melanomas thicker than 2.0 mm are still awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Ringborg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ringborg 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>The Intergroup trial design utilised the method of Zelen randomisation, a reasonable and accepted approach of the 'day', but one which has since proved controversial.</P>
<P>Zelen (<LINK REF="REF-Zelen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelen 1979</LINK>) proposed this novel 'randomised consent' design, whereby participants are asked for their consent after rather than before randomisation, with the aim of increasing recruitment by avoiding some of the problems associated with obtaining informed consent.

<P>Some of the trials used stratification to achieve balance. In the BAPS/MSG study, stratification was performed by centre and the extent of primary surgery. Permuted blocks of random size were used. In the Swedish Melanoma Study Group trial, the random allocation was done using balanced lists. At three of the trial centres, separate lists for each participating hospital were used. At the remaining two centres, there was no stratification by hospital.</P>

<P>Two of the studies, the BAPS/MSG and Swedish trials, had sufficient description of the study methods to indicate that adequate concealment of allocation had occurred. The BAPS/MSG trial achieved allocation concealment using centralised telephone randomisation. The Swedish trial used randomisation lists, but the personal data of each randomised participant and the tumour thickness were noted on the list before the assigned treatment was revealed.</P>
<P>In the WHO study, the co-ordinating centre sent each participating centre a series of sealed envelopes, each containing a randomisation number and the treatment to be assigned. A copy of the randomisation series was kept by a secretariat so the randomisation procedure of each centre could be checked. There was no mention of the opaqueness of the envelopes. The Cochrane handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) implies that sealed envelopes constitute unclear allocation concealment unless they are also described as sequentially numbered and opaque, so we have classed the WHO trial as unclear allocation concealment.</P>
<P>In the other two studies, there was no mention of any allocation concealment.</P>

<P>A quality of life study was carried out as part of the BAPS/MSG trial and reported in a separate publication [<LINK REF="REF-Newton_x002d_Bishop-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton-Bishop 2004</LINK>]. Data were collected from 426 of 537 participants who were mailed the questionnaires, a response rate of 79%.</P>
<P>The study had 2 aims. First, to test the hypothesis that melanoma participants treated with a 3 cm excision margin suffer greater impairment of their quality of life than those treated with a 1 cm margin. Second, to determine the predictors of a poor participant perception of their excision scar. The questionnaire utilised the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), Psychosocial Adjustment of Illness Scale-Self-Report (PAIS-SR), Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form 36 (MOS-SF36), and the Cassileth Scar questionnaires.</P>
<P>The results of the study showed that participants treated with a 3 cm excision margin had significantly poorer physical and mental function (as defined by physical component summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS] of the MOS-SF36) than the narrow margin group 1 month after surgery (P = 0.003 and 0.008, respectively). The magnitude of effect is shown graphically; all results appear to lie within the overall UK population mean plus/minus 1 standard deviation. However, from 6 months onwards, there was little difference in PCS and MCS scores (P = 0.85, P = 0.63) between the 2 groups.</P>
<P>Those treated by a 3 cm margin reported a poorer perception of their scar than those treated by a 1 cm margin, a difference which persisted throughout the study period. The overall magnitude of this difference was statistically significant (scar scores were 19% lower in the wide margin group; 95% CI 15% to 23%; P &lt; 0.0001) but it is unclear how this related to people in clinically meaningful terms.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that the use of a 3 cm excision margin for melanoma is associated with significantly more morbidity than use of a 1 cm margin, but that this effect disappeared by 6 months. However, those participants treated by 3 cm excision were more likely to have a persistent poor view of their scar.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:36:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>This systematic review summarises the evidence regarding the width of surgical excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma. None of the five published trials has shown a statistically significant difference in overall survival when comparing narrow with wide excision. Furthermore, our meta-analysis has not shown a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups that were treated with narrow or wide excision.</P>
<P>The point estimate for overall survival favoured wide excision by a small degree [Hazard Ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.15, P = 0.40] but the result was not significantly different. This result is compatible with both a 5% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring narrower excision and a 15% relative reduction in overall mortality favouring wider excision. Therefore, a small (but potentially important) difference in overall survival between wide and narrow excision margins cannot be confidently ruled out, such as a 10 year survival rate of 85% compared to one of between 81% and 87%.</P>
<P>The point estimate for recurrence-free survival favoured wide excision [Hazard Ratio 1.13, P = 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.28] but the result did not reach statistical significance at the P &lt; 0.05 level. This result is compatible with both a 1% relative reduction in mortality favouring narrower excision and a 15% relative reduction in mortality favouring wider excision.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:37:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Although we requested further primary data (numbers of death versus Breslow thickness) for all the trials, this information was available from only two of the trials, the Intergroup and the Swedish trials. This limited our ability to perform a detailed meta-analysis and consequently reduced our capacity to define the optimal widths of surgical excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma. This problem was compounded by the heterogeneity of the excision margins used in individual trials. Further, there are limited RCT data assessing treatment of thin melanomas &lt; 1 mm and thick melanomas &#8805; 4 mm.</P>
<P>The five trials included in our review do not adequately address the issues of melanomas in specific body sites, such as head and neck, distal extremities, hands (including fingers and subungual melanomas), and feet.</P>
<P>In particular, the relative paucity of available RCT data leaves clinicians with little guidance on the clinical management of facial melanomas (only the French study included melanomas on the head and neck and this involved only 16 participants). There are differences between facial melanomas and those on the trunk or extremities and it is unclear whether data on truncal lesions can be extrapolated to facial lesions. For example, recommendations for depth of excision which are typically 'to fascia' are difficult to apply on the nose or eyelid or ear, because in these sites the fascia may be less well defined. The morbidity (particularly 'cost' for reconstruction or potential disfigurement) associated with wider excisions on the face is likely to be greater than for those on the trunk. For example, even 1 cm margins are potentially problematic in critical facial locations. For this reason, some experts have advocated narrower margins on the face but there are no RCT data to help determine the consequences on mortality or recurrence of these narrower margins.</P>
<P>Management of digital melanomas including the subset of subungual melanomas often includes partial amputation. As with facial lesions, there are no RCTs available to help determine if less aggressive surgery would be as effective.</P>
<P>The RCTs, international guidelines, and our Cochrane review concentrate on measured clinical excision margins (in whole number of centimetres) and Breslow thickness (stratified in 1 mm categories) as they relate to mortality and morbidity. This makes the studies more straightforward to measure and analyse. However, it seems biologically implausible that, for example, a 1.9 mm thick melanoma would behave significantly differently to a 2.1 mm thick melanoma, or a 3.9 mm thick melanoma would behave significantly differently to a 4.1 mm thick melanoma. Similarly it seems unlikely that a 2.1 cm margin, for example, would produce better outcomes than a 1.9 cm margin. Perhaps, partly by necessity, the trials are a little artificial in nature. It is probably impossible to make an accurate recommendation about the margin of excision required for each different melanoma in each individual person.</P>
<P>All but one study (Swedish study) had age restrictions and either excluded older participants or younger participants or (sometimes) both. It is not clear how this would affect melanoma management in older people.</P>
<P>There is little mention about 'informed consent' of participants or whether studies underwent appropriate 'medical research ethics review'. Most of the trials were designed 20 to 30 years ago, perhaps at a time when 'consent' and 'ethics' were not deemed of such paramount importance as they are today.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:38:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Several limitations of this systematic review need to be addressed. As with any meta-analysis there is the potential for publication bias to over-estimate differences in outcomes if studies identifying such differences are more likely to be published in peer-reviewed journals. However, our systematic search of the literature and the fact that we have contacted several 'leading authors and experts' in the field of melanoma management means that it is unlikely that we have missed any studies including substantial numbers of participants.</P>
<P>The total number of studies identified in this meta-analysis is modest simply because there are only five reported randomised trials which have examined melanoma excision margins. This has the effect of decreasing the statistical power to detect real differences in outcomes, thus reducing the robustness of our estimates. However, the total number of participants identified in this meta-analysis is moderately large with approximately 3300 participants in the pooled analysis. Therefore, although it is possible that inadequate numbers were pooled for a clinically significant outcome difference, it suggests that if there is a true difference, then it is relatively small (of course acknowledging that small differences may be very important for individuals).</P>
<P>The five included studies are clinically heterogeneous (although they are not statistically heterogeneous). The range of excision margins deemed 'narrow' or 'wide' can dilute the effect size of potential outcome differences if only a subset of studies utilised an adequately narrow comparator. Thus, our meta-analysis may under-estimate potential true differences in outcome. Notably the absence of consistent excision margin definitions also limits our ability to make firm recommendations with regard to appropriate excision margins should any difference be detected.</P>
<P>The available data indicate that patients with thin melanomas are unlikely to benefit from very wide excisions. For example, of 762 (159 French, 244 Swedish, 359 WHO) participants with melanomas &lt; 1 mm thick, roughly 380 (79 French, 123 Swedish, 171 WHO) were treated with a wide excision margin. As these patients are unlikely to benefit from this wide excision, it is possible that the results are diluted down and may mask a small effect. Similarly as 5 cm excision margins are now considered excessive (although not at the time of RCT study design), results from these trials may &#8216;overwhelm&#8217; the results of our meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We have not examined in detail quality of life and cost-effectiveness in our analysis. These are valuable parameters for developing sensible clinical decisions and practice guidelines but there are limited published data which address these issues.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that a narrower margin would provide better survival outcomes than a wider excision (unless the procedures involved with wide excision resulted in excess mortality), so an important perspective of a review about melanoma margins could be to look for evidence of equivalence or non-inferiority of a narrower excision margin compared to a wider one. In this situation, the question could be posed "is a narrower margin not importantly worse than a wide one?" rather than superiority of a wider margin. However, the perspective of this review is not non-inferiority, since the aim was to quantify the uncertainty around the benefits and risks so that individuals can decide, with the support of health professionals, what the appropriate decision is for them. None of the included RCTs appear to have been designed or reported as a formal non-inferiority or equivalence study. Any future randomised trials should be sized to aim for a pre-specified precision for estimation of the potential inferiority in primary outcomes.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:39:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Three systematic reviews, each including meta-analysis, examining excision margins for primary cutaneous melanomas have previously been published.</P>

<P>The second (<LINK REF="REF-Haigh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haigh 2003</LINK>) included three RCTs. Haigh et al concluded that</P>
<OL>
<LI>'a surgical excision of no more than 2 cm around a melanoma of the trunk or extremities is adequate'; and</LI>

<P>Recently, Lens updated his meta-analysis to include all five currently published RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Lens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lens 2007</LINK>).

<P>We performed our analysis differently to that of Lens (<LINK REF="REF-Lens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lens 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lens 2007</LINK> used rates based on the total observed events, which may be difficult to interpret because all the participants have not been followed up for the same time period (Cochrane handbook, section 9.2.6 <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We used hazard ratios for the primary analysis which summarise the average effect over the duration of follow-up. (Cochrane handbook, section 7.7.6 <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Our approach is in line with that recommended in the Cochrane handbook (sections 7.7.6 and 9.2.6), 'The most appropriate way of summarising time-to-event data is to use methods of survival analysis and express the intervention effect as a hazard ratio'. However, in this case the results produced by both methods are similar.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-30 03:14:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the individual trials, nor our meta-analysis, has shown a statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups that were treated with narrow or wide excision margins. Current randomised trial evidence is insufficient to address optimal excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma.</P>
<P>Despite this, however, numerous expert international committees have produced fairly consistent guidelines for melanoma excision margins.</P>
<P>It is important to determine whether the absence of any statistically significant overall survival difference in randomised studies (or meta-analyses thereof) conducted to date preclude the possibility that there may actually be a real but very small difference in survival for different margin widths (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>). So far this question remains unanswered. There is a potential for causing harm if excision margins become excessively narrow. Narrow excision margins reduce surgical morbidity and complications, and the need for general anaesthesia, but should only be used if cure is not compromised.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:40:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Further randomised trials would be needed to clarify optimal excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma. Any future trials should be appropriately designed and powered to determine whether different subsets of Breslow thickness can be treated with different excision margins and, if so, the minimum optimal margins.</P>
<P>Current data suggest that 'narrow' margins produce similar outcomes to 'wider' margins so perhaps trials should compare different degrees of narrow excision margin, for example 1 versus 2 cm. However, an extremely large study would be required to demonstrate a lack of important difference between these different excision margins, because only a very small survival deficit (if any) would be acceptable. Similarly, a prospective trial for facial melanomas, perhaps comparing 0.5 cm and 1.0 cm excision margins, would be clinically very useful, but would likely require huge numbers of participants and resources.</P>
<P>In future trials, primary outcomes should focus on overall survival and report number of events. Authors should provide clear and consistent definitions of 'recurrences'. All trials should include and assess quality of life outcomes.</P>
<P>Individual patient data meta-analysis could be helpful in further investigating the impact of Breslow thickness on excision margins.</P>
<P>Access to detailed outcome data, broken down by Breslow thickness, would enhance the quality of future meta-analyses. This might improve the quality of treatment recommendations and subsequent care, and help researchers focus on the most appropriate clinical questions.</P>

<P>In the protocol we planned to perform a subgroup analysis based on Breslow thickness of melanoma and a subgroup analysis based on body site of melanoma, however there was insufficient data to perform either of these analyses.</P>
<P>In the protocol, we mentioned only clinical margins. However, in the final review we though it important to clarify that the RCTs only measured clinical margins and not histological margins.</P>
<P>In the protocol, we mentioned &#8216;short-term&#8217; (1 to 2yrs) analysis. However, none of the RCTs published such short-term data so we have could not analyse it in the review.</P>
