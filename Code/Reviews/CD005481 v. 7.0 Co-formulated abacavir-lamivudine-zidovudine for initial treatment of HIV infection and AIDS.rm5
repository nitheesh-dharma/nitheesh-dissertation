<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-29 20:15:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>UNAIDS estimates that 34 million people are currently living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. Currently recommended regimens for initiating HIV treatment consist of either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, there may be some patients for whom NNRTIs and PIs may not be appropriate. This is an update of the review published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009.</P>

<P>Between December 2010 and July 2011, we used standard Cochrane methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-21 08:05:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum follow-up time of six months which compared co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine with either PI-based or NNRTI-based therapy among antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients aged at least 13 years.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-08 07:38:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving discrepancies by consensus. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), as appropriate, with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and conducted meta-analysis using the random-effects method because of significant statistical heterogeneity (P&lt;0.1).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-29 20:15:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 15 potentially eligible RCTs, four of which met our inclusion criteria. The four included RCTs were conducted in the United States of America (USA); USA, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Panama; USA and Mexico; and Botswana, respectively. The RCTs compared co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine to treatment based on efavirenz (NNRTI), nelfinavir (PI), atazanavir (PI), and co-formulated lopinavir-ritonavir (PI), respectively. Overall, there was no significant difference in virological suppression between co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine and NNRTI- or PI-based therapy (4 trials; 2247 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36). However, the results showed significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=79%); with co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine inferior to NNRTI (1 trial, 1147 participants: RR 0.35, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.49) but with a trend towards co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine being superior to PI (3 trials, 1110 participants: RR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.16; I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%). We found no significant differences between co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine and either PI or NNRTI on CD4+ cell counts (3 trials, 1687 participants: MD -0.01, 95%CI -0.11 to 0.09; I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%), severe adverse events (4 trials: RR 1.22, 95%CI 0.78 to 1.92; I<SUP>2</SUP>=62%) and hypersensitivity reactions (4 trials: RR 4.04, 95% CI 0.41 to 40.02; I<SUP>2</SUP>=72%). Only two studies involving PIs reported data on the lipid profile. One study found that the mean increase in total cholesterol from baseline to 96 weeks was significantly lower with co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine than with nelfinavir, but there were no differences with triglyceride levels. The second study found the fasting lipid profile to be comparable in both co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine and atazanavir arms at 48 weeks.</P>
<P>The significant heterogeneity of effects for most outcomes evaluated was largely due to differences in the control therapy used in the included trials (i.e. NNRTIs or PIs). Using the GRADE approach, we rated the overall quality of the evidence on the relative effects of co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine for initial treatment of HIV infection as moderate. The main reason for downgrading the quality of the evidence was imprecision of the findings. The estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome has wide confidence intervals, which extend from the fixed-dose NRTI combination regimen being appreciably better to the regimen being appreciably worse than PI- or NNRTI-based regimens.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-29 20:15:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides evidence that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine remains a viable option for initiating antiretroviral therapy, especially in HIV-infected patients with pre-existing hyperlipidaemia. The varied geographical locations of the included trials augment the external validity of these findings. We are moderately confident in our estimate of the treatment effects of the triple NRTI regimen as initial therapy for HIV infection. In the context of the GRADE approach, such moderate quality of evidence implies that the true effects of the regimen are likely to be close to the estimate of effects found in this review; but there is a possibility that they could be substantially different.  Further research should be geared towards defining the subgroup of HIV patients for whom this regimen will be most beneficial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-14 08:53:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic poses one of the greatest challenges to global public health. In 2011, an estimated 34 million people were living with HIV and 1.7 million died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS 2012). Prevention is commonly advocated to curb the spread of HIV infection, and although preventive methods have considerably slowed the spread of HIV in most parts of the world, people who are already infected need care and treatment.</P>
<P>The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve prolonged suppression of HIV replication. The ideal antiretroviral drugs should be effective in suppressing viral replication, affordable, available in simplified regimens, well tolerated, and have no dietary interactions. The use of monotherapy and dual therapy has often led to mutations and long-term resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Eron-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eron 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pialoux-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pialoux 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 2003</LINK>), necessitating the development of combination therapy with three drugs taken separately (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammer 2008</LINK>). In well-resourced countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ledergerber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledergerber 1999</LINK>) and, recently, Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teixeira-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teixeira 2004</LINK>), antiretroviral therapy has contributed substantially towards delaying HIV progression to AIDS and death. However, these combinations are complex and difficult to take due to high pill burden, stringent intake schedules, and food and fluid restrictions They may also be associated with drug-drug interactions and numerous side effects, including various lipid abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gifford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 2000</LINK>). This complexity also makes antiretroviral therapy less accessible to patients in most resource-constrained regions of the world, which currently are hardest hit by the pandemic, such as sub-Saharan Africa. This area is inhabited by approximately 10% of the world's population but is home to 60% of all people currently living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concern over toxicity, adherence, and drug-drug interactions has led to the development of simpler antiretroviral regimens, including co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine (<LINK REF="REF-Anon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saez_x002d_Llorens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saez-Llorens 2001</LINK>). Three NRTIs simplify PI-based therapy by easing dosing regimens (only one tablet twice daily) and avoiding lipid abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Seaton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaton 2003</LINK>). Although treatment simplification could help patients maintain adherence, continued virologic suppression must be ensured. Therefore, clarification of the role of this simplified antiretroviral therapy on prolonged suppression of HIV replication is of considerable importance. Because all three antiretroviral drugs are of the same class, the use of co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine (if proven to be effective) potentially preserves NNRTIs and PIs for later use, thereby avoiding resistance to all classes of antiretroviral agents at the same time, and allows for effective second-line treatment regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Staszewski--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Staszewski 2001</LINK>). There are concerns, however, about hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir (<LINK REF="REF-Staszewski-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staszewski 1998</LINK>). Cross resistance between drugs of the same class should also be considered. Also, entecavir used for hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment, may select for M184V mutation which confers resistance to lamivudine in individuals co-infected with HIV and HBV (<LINK REF="REF-McMahon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to combine all high-quality RCTs comparing co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine with PI- or NNRTI-based therapy to assess the antiviral potency and tolerability of the simplified triple nucleoside combination in initial therapy for HIV.</P>

<P>See: HIV/AIDS Collaborative Review Group search strategy.</P>
<P>Between February 2008 and May 2009, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the York Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for previous reviews and meta-analyses of antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV that included co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine; and searched the references of these reviews for reports of eligible trials. We then carried out an exhaustive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, NLM GATEWAY, and AIDSearch, for randomised controlled trials of co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine for initial treatment of HIV, using standardised methodological filters (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) where appropriate. We also searched reference lists of identified articles.There were no time or language restrictions to our search.</P>
<P>We updated the search in December 2010 by searching EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). In addition, in July 2011, we finalised the update by searching CENTRAL, and PubMed.</P>

<P>The Trials Search Coordinator of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group (http://www.igh.org/Cochrane/) conducted the electronic database searches. For the original version of the review and this update, three authors (MS, EJK, and CSW) independently conducted the selection of potentially relevant studies by scanning the titles and abstracts of all material downloaded from the electronic searches. Irrelevant reports were discarded and the full articles were obtained for all potentially relevant or uncertain reports. From this pool of potentially eligible studies, we selected studies for inclusion in the review if they were RCTs (study design) comparing any fixed-dose combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (NRTI) with PI- or NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy (intervention) in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected adults (participants). Disagreements between the review authors were resolved by discussion and consensus. When no consensus could be reached, SMA and JS arbitrated.</P>

<P>We assessed risk of bias as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Three review authors (MS, EJK, and CSW) independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study by addressing seven specific domains, namely, random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and &#8216;other issues'. For each included trial, the authors independently described what the study authors reported that they did for each domain and then made a decision relating to the risk of bias for that domain by assigning a judgement of 'Low risk' of bias, 'High risk' of bias, or 'Unclear risk' of bias. The review authors compared the results of their independent assessments of risk of bias and resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. When no consensus could be reached, SMA and JS arbitrated.</P>

<P>We undertook meta-analysis using RevMan 5. We analysed all participants in the groups to which they were randomised, irrespective of whether they received the allocated intervention, and assessed heterogeneity between study results using the chi-square test of homogeneity, with significance defined at the 10% level (www.cochrane-handbook.org). We expressed each trial result as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and combined the results using the random-effects method because of significant heterogeneity. We also used the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic to describe the percentage of between-study variability in effect estimates, which is attributable to true heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We used the GRADE method to rate the quality of evidence on the effectiveness of the triple NRTI regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>), and have presented these ratings in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. High quality evidence implies that &#8220;further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect&#8221;. Moderate quality evidence means &#8220;further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate&#8221;. Evidence is considered of low quality if &#8220;further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate&#8221;, and very low quality if &#8220;we have very little confidence in the effect estimate&#8221;. In this review we considered five factors when grading the quality of evidence on the relative effects of fixed-dose NRTI regimen for initiating HIV treatment; namely, risk of bias in included RCTs, unexplained heterogeneity of effects, indirectness of the evidence, imprecision of the findings, and possibility of publication bias. Regarding risk of bias, we were most concerned with lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding of outcome assessment, and a large loss to follow-up. Heterogeneity of effects across studies for which there were no compelling explanations would also have reduced our confidence in the evidence. Indirectness refers to differences between the population, intervention, comparison group and outcome of interest to us, and those reported by the included RCTs. For imprecision, if we found that studies included relatively few participants and few events and thus had estimates of effects with wide confidence intervals, we rated down the quality of the evidence. Finally, we would also have rated down the quality of evidence if there was a high likelihood of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Gulick 2004 trial recruited 1147 participants from 33 units of The AIDs Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) in the United States of America (USA); the Kumar 2006 trial recruited 261 participants from 34 sites in the USA, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Panama; the Kumar 2009 study recruited 279 participants from 46 sites in the USA and Mexico; and the Shapiro 2010 trial recruited 560 women in both urban and rural areas in Botswana. The four trials only included participants who were antiretroviral-naive. The Gulick 2004 and Kumar 2009 trials recruited predominantly male participants (81% and 79%, respectively), while only 50% of participants in the Kumar 2006 trial were men. Finally, all participants in the Shapiro 2010 trial were women.</P>
<P>Participants in the Gulick 2004 trial had mean age 38 years (SD 9 years), were 40% white, 36% African American, and 21% Hispanic and had mean HIV-1 RNA level of 4.85 log<SUB>10</SUB> copies/mL (SD 0.70) and mean CD4+ cell count of 234 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> (SD 187). Participants in the Kumar 2006 trial had median age 34 years (range 18-60 years), were 21% white, 40% African American, and 37% Hispanic, and had median HIV-1 RNA level of 4.44 log<SUB>10</SUB> copies/mL (range 2.23 to 5.77) and median CD4 cell count of 339 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> (range 19 to 1269). Participants in the Kumar 2009 study had median age 37 years (range 18 to 68 years), HIV-1 RNA levels between 2.3 and 5.6 log<SUB>10</SUB> copies/mL, and CD4+ cell counts from 103 to 889 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. Participants in the Shapiro 2010 trial were pregnant women, aged 18 years or older, were presumably all black Africans, and had median HIV-1 RNA levels of 13,300 copies/mL in the NRTI arm and 9,100 in the PI arm, and a CD4+ cell count of at least 200 cells/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>(median 393 cells/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>in the NRTI arm and 403 cells/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>in the PI arm).</P>
<P>The participants in the Gulick 2004 trial were randomised to either zidovudine (ZDV)-lamivudine(3TC)-abacavir (ABC) [Trizivir®], or ZDV-3TC [Combivir®] + efavirenz [a NNRTI] or Trizivir® + efavirenz. Participants took a total of seven pills per day, including placebo tablets, divided into two doses. In the Kumar 2006 trial, participants were assigned to either Trizivir® twice daily, or Combivir® + nelfinavir [a PI] 1250 mg twice daily, or stavudine [d4T] 40 mg + 3TC 150 mg + nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily. In Kumar 2009, participants were randomised to receive either Trizivir® or atazanavir plus lamivudine and zidovudine. In Shapiro 2010, participants were randomised to receive Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP> twice daily in the NRTI arm, or 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir [co-formulated as Kaletra<SUP>®</SUP>] twice daily in the PI arm. The Shaipro 2010 trial also had a third group of participants (observational arm) who received Combivir<SUP>®</SUP> twice daily. This observational arm was not included in our analysis.<BR/>

<B>Generation of allocation sequence</B>
</P>
<P>Three trials did not provide an adequate description of the methods used for generating the allocation sequence, but all were described as randomised [<LINK REF="STD-Gulick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gulick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2009</LINK>]. However, the equal allocation of participants suggests that a computer-generated block randomisation process was used. In the Shapiro 2010 trial, participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups based upon computer-generated lists (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Allo cation concealment</B>
</P>
<P>The Gulick 2004, Kumar 2009, and Shapiro 2010 trials used central randomisation, suggesting that allocation concealment in all three trials was adequate. The Kumar 2006 trial did not provide sufficient detail to describe the allocation concealment process.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
</P>
<P>In the Gulick 2004 trial, participants, providers, and outcome assessors were all blinded. In the Kumar 2006 and Kumar 2009 trials, the participants and providers were not blinded, but it was not clear if the outcome assessors were blinded. In the Shapiro 2010 trial, no details were given about blinding of participants, providers, or outcome assessors.</P>
<P>
<B>Loss to follow-up</B>
</P>
<P>When the triple-nucleoside arm was stopped in the Gulick 2004 trial after a median of 32 weeks, 83 participants (7%) had discontinued the study for various reasons, including withdrawal of consent (2%) and loss to follow-up (2%). In the Kumar 2006 trial, loss to follow-up at 96 weeks was 26.4% for Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP>, 24.2% for COM/NFV, and 14.5% for d4T/3TC/NFV groups. In the Kumar 2009 trial, 9% and 10% of the participants were lost to follow-up in the Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP> and ATV + 3TC/ZDV arms, respectively. In the Shapiro 2010 trial 15(5.2%) women in the Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP> and 13(5.1%) in Kaletra<SUP>®</SUP> arms left the study for reasons that are not stated.</P>

<P>There was significant heterogeneity between the included trials in the incidence of virological failure (3 trials, 1687 participants, heterogeneity P=0.009, I<SUP>2</SUP>=79%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The Kumar studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2009</LINK>) did not find a significant difference in the incidence of virological failure between participants on NRTIs and those on a PI (i.e. nelfinavir or atazanavir) (two trials, 540 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.36; heterogeneity P=0.21, I<SUP>2</SUP>=35%). Gulick and colleagues found that participants on NRTIs had a significantly higher incidence of virological failure than did those on the NNRTI efavirenz (1 trial, 1147 participants: RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.55). Overall, there was no significant difference between the participants on NRTIs and those on either PI-based or NNRTI-based therapy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.32).</P>

For viral load of &lt;50 copies/mL, the risk ratios were 1.15 (0.83 to 1.59) in the Kumar 2006 trial, 1.03 (0.85 to 1.25) in the Kumar 2009 trial, 0.73 (0.67 to 0.80) in the Gulick 2004 trial, 1.08 (0.99 to 1.17) in the Shapiro 2010 trial, and 0.97 (0.75 to 1.25) overall (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). For viral load of &lt;400 copies/mL, the risk ratios were 1.10 (0.65 to 1.84) in the Kumar 2006 trial, 0.96 (0.58 to 1.58) in the Kumar 2009 trial, 0.35 (0..26 to 0.49) in the Gulick 2004 trial, and 0.73 (0.39 to 1.36) overall (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no significant differences between NRTIs and either PIs or NNRTIs on CD4+ cell counts (3 trials, 1687 participants: mean difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.09, I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%: <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), the incidence of severe adverse events (4 trials; 2247 participants: RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.92, I<SUP>2</SUP>=62%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and hypersensitivity reactions (RR 4.04, 95% CI 0.41 to 40.02, I<SUP>2</SUP>=72%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The Shapiro trial did not encounter a hypersensitivity reaction in any treatment group.</P>
<P>Gulick 2004 and Shapiro 2010 did not report on lipid levels. At week 96, Kumar 2006 found the least squares means increase in total cholesterol from baseline was significantly lower with NRTIs than with nelfinavir. Kumar 2006 also found that mean total cholesterol remained below 200mg/dL only in the NRTI group, and the proportion of patients with total cholesterol levels more than 200mg/dL after 96 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the NRTI group. At 96 weeks, Kumar 2006 found no significant differences between the comparison groups in least squares means triglyceride levels and least squares means change from baseline in triglyceride levels. At 48 weeks, Kumar 2009 found the fasting lipids to be comparable in both the NRTI and atazanavir arms.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-01-29 20:16:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The large Gulick 2004 trial found the co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine regimen to be virologically inferior to a regimen containing efavirenz and two or three nucleoside analogues after 32 weeks; Kumar 2006 and Kumar 2009 found the triple nucleoside fixed-dose combination to be equivalent to nelfinavir- and atazanavir-based regimens in maintaining virological suppression over 96 weeks and 48 weeks, respectively; but Shapiro 2010 found viral suppression to be relatively superior in the co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine arm compared to the co-formulated lopinavir-ritonavir arm after six months of therapy. The significant heterogeneity of effects was largely due to differences in the control therapy used in the included trials (i.e. NNRTIs or PIs). Pooling the four trials, we did not find significant differences in virological suppression between initiating treatment with the triple nucleoside fixed-dose combination (NRTI) and therapy based on efavirenz (NNRTI), lopinavir-ritonavir (PI), nelfinavir (PI), or atazanavir (PI). In addition, the triple nucleoside fixed-dose combination regimen was well tolerated and had no deleterious effects on the lipid profile. Using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>), we rated the overall quality of the evidence on the relative effects of the fixed-dose NRTI regimen for initiating HIV treatment as moderate. The main reason for downgrading the quality of the evidence was imprecision of the findings. The estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome has wide confidence intervals, which extend from the fixed-dose NRTI combination regimen being appreciably better to the regimen being appreciably worse than PI- or NNRTI-based regimens (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Shapiro 2010 trial examined the use of Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP> (NRTI) or Kaletra<SUP>® </SUP>(PI) as first-line therapy in HIV-infected pregnant women. Eventhough the rate of viral suppression after six months of follow-up (up till postpartum period) did not show any difference between the interventions, there was a significant increase in viral suppression to below 50 copies/ml with Trizivir<SUP>®</SUP> compared to Keletra<SUP>®</SUP> at delivery (81% and 69%, respectively). This difference was not observed when the viral set point was raised to 400 copies/ml (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Kumar 2006 study compared NRTI with a PI (nelfinavir) which is no longer a component of initial recommended regimen. The comparator nelfinavir has been shown to be inferior to current PI regimens both in tolerability and virological suppression and is no longer a preferred treatment option (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>). There is considerable heterogeneity amongst PIs as far as tolerability is concerned, with newer members of the class, such as atazanavir, very suitable for individuals with hyperlipidaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2009</LINK>). Ritonavir-boosted PIs are now routinely used to initiate therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ananworanich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananworanich 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potard 2007</LINK>). Ritonavir was not included in any of the comparator arms of either the Kumar or Gulick studies but was included in the Shapiro trial. However, ritonavir may not be appropriate for some HIV-infected patients, such as those with pre-existing hyperlipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, underlying severe depression, and intolerance of ritonavir. For the latter, it is important to have a treatment regimen that is both efficacious and safe (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients requires regimens that have the potential to be used for a long period without the fear of mutations often associated with failing regimens. Treatment with co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine offers the opportunity for patients to switch over to other antiretroviral classes in case of treatment failure. Patients failing on co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine are unlikely to be associated with emergence of multi-NRTI resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Shaefer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaefer 2004</LINK>). However, components of the fixed-dose combination regimen have been associated with certain side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Shaefer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaefer 2004</LINK>). Zidovudine may cause anaemia in some patients, lamivudine is associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, while abacavir is commonly associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Recent studies have shown that abacavir is associated with fatal hypersensitivity reactions in patients with a rare human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B*5701 (<LINK REF="REF-Mallal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saag-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 2008</LINK>). This suggests the need for genetic screening in individuals receiving abacavir-based therapy to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with the drug, which are often characterized by two or more clinical signs or symptoms that can include fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and constitutional symptoms. Shapiro and colleagues did not observe any abacavir-related hypersensitivity reactions in their trial conducted in Botswana as none of their participants tested positive for HLA-B*5701 (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our findings indicate that the triple nucleoside fixed-dose combination remains a viable option for initiating anti-retroviral therapy, especially in HIV-infected patients with pre-existing hyperlipidaemia; possibly preventing exacerbation of the condition and obviating the need for antihyperlipidaemic agents and their incumbent drug interactions. Like any other antiretroviral therapy, constant monitoring of patients receiving this combination drug is advised to detect any resistance or side effects that may be attributed to abacavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine.</P>
<P>Publication and language biases are potential threats to all systematic reviews. We did not restrict our search to any language or publication status (published or unpublished). We are therefore confident that we have identified all existing randomised controlled trials relevant to our question but cannot rule out the possibility that there are additional trials that are unpublished or published in sources not accessible to our search.</P>

<P>We found that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine remains a viable option for initiating anti-retroviral therapy, especially in HIV-infected patients with pre-existing hyperlipidaemia and those who do not tolerate ritonavir. The varied geographical locations of the included trials augment the external validity of our findings. We are moderately confident in our estimate of the treatment effects of the triple NRTI regimen as initial therapy for HIV infection. In the context of the GRADE approach, such moderate quality of evidence implies that the true effects of the regimen are likely to be close to the estimate of effects found in this review.</P>

<P>There is a need for antiretroviral treatment programmes to have robust monitoring systems capable of identifying patients most likely to develop severe adverse events, viral resistance, and mutations. Further research on co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine should be geared towards defining the subgroup of HIV patients for whom this regimen will be most beneficial.</P>

<P>We question the ability to make a decisive conclusion with regards to the efficacy of this regimen, given the degree of heterogeneity present in the review (Analysis 1.1, I2 = 79%; Analysis 1.2, I2 = 85%; Analysis 1.3, I2 = 93%). It is stated that the heterogeneity observed in the four studies is primarily a result of differences in the comparator regimens of the included trials (i.e. NNRTI- vs. PI-based regimens). However, other possible explanations for the heterogeneity observed are not explored. Of note, there is great diversity in the study populations, which could be a significant source of heterogeneity. Shapiro 2010 studied a population made up exclusively of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Botswana, whereas the studied populations in Gulick 2004 and Kumar 2009 were predominantly made up of males in North America. A minority of patients in Kumar 2006, Kumar 2009, &amp; Shapiro 2010 had baseline viral loads of &gt; 100 000 copies/mL, whereas Gulick 2004 included a greater proportion of patients with levels above 100 000 copies/mL. Given this diversity in study populations, along with the overall substantial heterogeneity measured, it is perplexing that the review authors were able to draw any decisive conclusion, let alone one that is seemingly to be applied to the general population of HIV patients. In the context of these shortcomings, we feel it is unsubstantiated to broadly conclude that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine remains a &#8216;viable&#8217; option. Additionally, we found the call for further research &#8216;geared towards defining the subgroup of HIV patients for whom this regimen will be most beneficial&#8217; a concerning statement, as it implies that this co-formulated triple nucleoside regimen is beneficial for all subgroups of patients. This cannot and should not be inferred from this review, especially given the wide diversity in findings from the pooled results. These range from suggesting that this triple nucleoside regimen is significantly inferior in some populations (Gulick 2004), to suggesting it is no different than the PI- or NNRTI-based comparator regimens. A more objective conclusion would be that, based on the results of this review, one is unable to conclude that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine is a viable option in all patients.</P>
<P>In addition, the title of this review implies an inherent difference between co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine and the same drugs at the same doses formulated separately. Eight of eleven excluded trials were excluded because these three medications were not co-formulated, yet a difference between the two formulations was not assessed for or even justified in this review. Rather than omitting such a substantial amount of efficacy and safety data, a subgroup analysis could easily be performed to explore whether or not there is a true difference in the behaviour of the fixed-dose and separate-dose formulations. The absence of this data, unjustified, impacts confidence in the conclusions reached, as these conclusions may have differed had these additional eight trials been included. We suggest the review be amended to include an analysis of the eight trials excluded on the basis of not being fixed-dose formulations and, if pertinent, the title of the review changed to reflect its broadened scope.</P>
<P>In addition to concerns about the conclusions made with regards to this regimen&#8217;s efficacy, we wish to address those made regarding its safety. These conclusions were made based on the finding of no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events and hypersensitivity reactions between the abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine regimen and the comparator regimens. We acknowledge that the review authors go on to note the known risks of harm secondary to these agents, such as zidovudine-induced anemia and abacavir-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and that the authors also advocate for &#8216;constant monitoring&#8217; of patients on co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine in order to detect any side effects associated with this regimen. However, their overall conclusion that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine &#8216;remains a viable option for initiating anti-retroviral therapy&#8217; is misleading. In the RCTs included in the review, co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine is compared to regimens that all include at least one agent (i.e. AZT, d4T, NFV, and/or LPV/r) that is no longer recommended by North American guidelines as initial therapy due to toxicity concerns(1,2). Although the World Health Organization&#8217;s guidelines continue to list AZT as an alternative agent if first-line TDF + 3TC (or FTC) is contraindicated or unavailable, it is noted that AZT is not a preferred first-line agent(3). To prevent the false impression that co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine is &#8216;safe&#8217; simply because it was not found to cause more harm than its AZT- or d4T-based comparators, we suggest that a qualifying statement describing the relative safety of zidovudine compared to first-line NRTIs be included with the discussion of this result.</P>
<P>We additionally feel the risk of emergent NRTI resistance following failure of the abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine regimen was not explored in an unbiased manner. Resistance is an important outcome at time of virological failure, as resistance has important implications on future available regimens. This outcome seems particularly important for patients initiating on triple NRTI regimens for the purpose of avoiding adverse effects, as the true benefits this regimen offers may be overstated if a consequence of virological failure will be the need to switch to a more complex regimen made up of agents initially avoided. The lone mention of resistance in this review is limited to the discussion section, when it is noted that the emergence of multi-NRTI resistance is &#8216;unlikely&#8217; in the event of patients failing co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine. This statement was made not based on evaluations by the review authors themselves, but instead appears to be referenced from an opinion article authored by an employee of the industry that patented the co-formulation(4). Additionally, no context is provided as to how multi-NRTI resistance is being defined or measured, leaving it unclear as to whether this statement is referring to the likelihood of developing multiple mutations associated with resistance to more than one NRTI, mutations associated with multi-NRTI resistance, or phenotypic evidence of multi-NRTI resistance. Furthermore, the author of the opinion article in question evaluated resistance in a clinical trial setting, which underestimates the risk of resistance relative to the real-world setting(5,6). Thus, we suggest revisiting the topic of NRTI resistance to incorporate the objective evidence available and address the possibility of the emergence of multi-NRTI resistance following triple nucleoside regimen failure in a more in-depth and impartial manner. We recommend including the development of resistance as a secondary outcome in this review so as to encourage a more rigorous investigation of the risk of resistance as documented in the available literature. At the very least, we recommend an explicit explanation be made with regards to how multi-NRTI resistance is defined and measured.</P>
<P>Our final comment pertains to the analysis of the risk of bias in this review. The review restricted its analysis of bias to allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow-up. By restricting the analysis to these elements, several other highly relevant potential sources of bias were neglected. Specifically, the role of industry funding is an element of bias that is relevant to this review and has the potential to have important implications on the interpretation of its results. In a review of four RCTs with inconsistent direction of results, it seems particularly prudent to note that two of the three trials that concluded no difference between co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine and NNRTI- or PI-based regimens appear to contain significant potential for industry bias. Kumar 2006 was funded by the company that patented co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine, and Kumar 2009 was conceived and designed by two employees and one former employee of this company, all of whom went on to analyze and interpret the data, and eventually develop the manuscript. Gulick 2004 and Shapiro 2010 each have at least one author who declares industry conflicts; however, the trials appear to be independently funded. It has been reported that industry-sponsored drug trials are more likely to produce statistically significant results in favour of the industry&#8217;s product(7). In fact, a Cochrane review on industry sponsorship and research outcome concluded that the factors included in Cochrane&#8217;s risk of bias assessment tool are likely insufficient to capture the full effect of bias that industry sponsorship may impose on trials, suggesting that industry sponsorship should be discussed as a distinct factor when analyzing trials for risk of bias(8). A sensitivity analysis of industry-funded vs. independently funded studies whose authors declare conflicts of interest may provide some meaningful insight into the influence of industry sponsorship bias in this review.</P>
