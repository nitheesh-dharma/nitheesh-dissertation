<P>Endometriosis is a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue (the lining of the womb) outside the cavity of the womb. Many women with the disease suffer from menstrual pain and some suffer from infertility. Infertile women with endometriosis are often treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) but have a lower chance of becoming pregnant compared to women who are infertile with blocked tubes. It has been suggested that giving GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI could increase the chances of pregnancy. We have reviewed the literature and found that treating women for three to six months with GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI increases the odds of clinical pregnancy four-fold. However, at present there is no information on the effect of this treatment on the incidence of ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancies or complications arising for the women or their offspring.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Women with endometriosis who are treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have a lower pregnancy rate compared to women with tubal factor infertility. It has been suggested that the administration of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists for a few months prior to IVF or ICSI increases the pregnancy rate. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of administering GnRH agonists for three to six months prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We used computer searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register (NRR) and the MDSG Specialised Register of controlled trials. We handsearched proceedings of annual meetings of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). We reviewed lists of references in original research and review articles. We contacted experts in various countries to identify unpublished trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials using any GnRH agonist prior to IVF or ICSI to treat women with any degree of endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy or laparotomy </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent review authors abstracted data (HNS and JGV). We sent e-mails to investigators to seek additional information. We assessed the validity of each study using the methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook. The data were checked by the third review author (SD) and any disagreement was resolved by arbitration with the fourth review author (AA). We generated 2 x 2 tables for principal outcome measures. The Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel technique was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and assess statistical heterogeneity between studies. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials (with 165 women) were included. The live birth rate per woman was significantly higher in women receiving the GnRH agonist compared to the control group (OR 9.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 78.22). However, this was based on one trial reporting "viable pregnancy" only. The clinical pregnancy rate per woman was also significantly higher (three studies: OR 4.28, 95% CI 2.00 to 9.15). The information on miscarriage rates came from two trials with high heterogeneity and, therefore, results of the meta-analysis were doubtful. The included studies provided insufficient data to investigate the effects of administration of GnRH agonists on multiple or ectopic pregnancies, fetal abnormalities or other complications. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The administration of GnRH agonists for a period of three to six months prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by fourfold. Data regarding adverse effects of this therapy on the mother or fetus are not available at present. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-13 12:04:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Assisted reproduction is now an established method for the treatment of infertility in a multitude of clinical conditions, including endometriosis-associated infertility. However, the results of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for women with endometriosis-associated infertility are conflicting. Some studies reported significantly lower pregnancy and implantation rates in women with endometriosis-associated infertility treated with IVF compared to those with tubal factor or unexplained infertility, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Matson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arici-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arici 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 1997</LINK>). On the contrary, other studies found no statistically significant differences in the pregnancy and implantation rates between these two groups of women (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadevan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadevan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardle-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardle 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frydman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frydman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inoue-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inoue 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dmowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dmowski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerber-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivennes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivennes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanbo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanbo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padigas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padigas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of 22 non-randomised studies reported that the chance of achieving pregnancy was significantly lower for women with endometriosis (odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.70) when compared to women with tubal factor infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Barnhart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnhart 2002</LINK>). Multifactorial analysis also demonstrated a decrease in fertilization and implantation rates and a significant decrease in the number of oocytes retrieved for women with endometriosis. Pregnancy rates for women with severe endometriosis were significantly lower than for women with mild endometriosis (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87).</P>
<P>The lower pregnancy and implantation rates have been blamed on the poor quality of oocytes in women with endometriosis. It has been suggested that this poor quality results in decreased fertilization rates (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadevan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadevan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardle-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardle 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergendal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergendal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norenstedt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norenstedt 2001</LINK>). This in turn results in embryos of lower quality along with a reduced implantation rate, especially in severe endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shea-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shea 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yovich 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arici-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arici 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The poor quality of the oocytes is thought to result from the altered follicular environment in women with endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Garrido-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrido 2000</LINK>) and various alterations have been described in these women. These include, when compared to controls, an increase in the progesterone concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 1998a</LINK>), an increase in the concentration of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 1998b</LINK>), lower levels of cortisol (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>) and lower concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-one binding protein (IGFBP-1) in the follicular fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Cunha_x002d_Filho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunha-Filho 2003</LINK>). An increased expression of tumour necrotizing factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the cultured granulosa cells from women with endometriosis was also observed (<LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 2000</LINK>). The rate of apoptosis (cell death) in the granulosa cells obtained from women with endometriosis is also increased (<LINK REF="REF-Nakahara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakahara 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toya-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toya 2000</LINK>) and this may be mediated by elevated concentrations of soluble Fas ligand in the serum and peritoneal fluid of these women (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Velasco-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Velasco 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the contrary, endometrial receptivity does not seem to play a role in the lower pregnancy and implantation rates in women with endometriosis who are treated with IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Sung-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sung 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickman 2002</LINK>). In a cross-over experiment, Pellicer compared fertility parameters in different groups of women receiving donor oocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 2001</LINK>). They noted that when donor oocytes came from women without known endometriosis embryo development and implantation rates were similar for women with and without endometriosis. However, when the results of oocyte donation were classified according to the nature of the oocytes donated, women who received embryos derived from oocytes from women with endometriotic ovaries showed a significantly lower implantation rate compared to the controls (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to increase pregnancy and implantation rates in women with endometriosis being treated with IVF, various approaches have been proposed to treat the endometriosis prior to assisted conception with various claims of success.</P>
<P>Surgical removal of endometriomas (endometriosis cysts) prior to IVF or ICSI was found to diminish the success rate of assisted reproduction in three non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aboulghar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboulghar 2003</LINK>). In contrast, other non-randomised studies have found that laparoscopic cystectomy (cyst removal) of endometriomas did not diminish the ovarian response for IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Canis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marconi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marconi 2002</LINK>); and similarly, LASER vaporization (cauterization) of the internal wall of endometriomas prior to IVF did not significantly diminish the outcome of IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Donnez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyns-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyns 2003</LINK>). Finally, in non-randomised studies ultrasound-directed endometriotic cyst aspiration performed prior to IVF was associated with mixed results with some workers reporting significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates per cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Dicker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dicker 1991</LINK>) while others reported the opposite (<LINK REF="REF-Suganuma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suganuma 2002</LINK>). Moreover, endometrial cyst aspiration prior to or during IVF seems to be associated with an increased incidence of infection and tubo-ovarian abscess formation as shown in many observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Padila-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padila 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dicker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dicker 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaron-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaron 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nargund-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nargund 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Younis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Younis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from surgical approaches, various medical approaches to improve the results of IVF and ICSI in women with endometriosis have been proposed. In a randomised controlled study Kim found that immunotherapy with corticosteroids improved the clinical pregnancy rate in those women (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1997</LINK>). In another randomised study treatment with danazol prior to IVF or ICSI was found to increase the pregnancy rate significantly in women with repeated IVF failures (<LINK REF="REF-Tei-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tei 1998</LINK>). However, the latter two studies have not been replicated. Various non-randomised studies have also claimed that prolonged treatment with GnRH analogues prior to IVF and ICSI improves the pregnancy and implantation rates (<LINK REF="STD-Oehninger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Oehninger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chedid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chedid 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Velasco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Velasco 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Heterogeneity between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking the results of the chi-squared tests (Breslow-Day test). In case of statistical heterogeneity sources for the heterogeneity were considered and commented on. </P>
<P>If different GnRH agonist preparations had been used, subgroup analysis would have been performed to determine the effect of the type of preparation, dose, duration or method of administration on the outcome measures. </P>
<P>As most of the outcome measures for this review use binary data, the results of each study were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method with the fixed-effect model. Continuous outcome measures were to be analysed using the appropriate statistical tests (weighted mean difference (WMD) using a fixed-effect model). It is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for RCTs will be performed every two years and the review updated accordingly. <BR/> </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Initially 14 studies were identified but only three studies fulfilled our criteria and were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<I>Patient characteristics </I>
<BR/>In all three included studies endometriosis was diagnosed on the basis of laparoscopy or laparotomy. Studies included 165 women with varying degrees of endometriosis and were all published in English, as full reports. The <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> study described endometriosis as severe, <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK> included women with stage II to IV disease and <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> included women with stage I to IV disease. </P>
<P>The mean age of participants ranged from 31 to 33 years (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>) and the age range was reported as 23 to 40 in <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>. One trial included women undergoing IVF and ICSI (<LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>) while the other two trials included only IVF (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). All included studies had a parallel design. </P>
<P>
<I>Interventions </I>
<BR/>The dose of FSH or HMG used was reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>) and the duration of FSH administration was reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>. The GnRH agonist used was decapeptyl by monthly injections for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>), goserelin by monthly injections for five to six months (<LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>) and leuprolide acetate intramuscular injections for three months (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Outcomes </I>
<BR/>Only one study reported viable pregnancies (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>). Although no details were given it is reasonable to assume that these pregnancies resulted in live birth. All three studies reported clinical pregnancy, but only one of these reported miscarriages per clinically pregnant woman (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>). <BR/>None of the studies reported live birth, the number of embryos obtained, the number of embryos frozen, the ectopic pregnancy rate, the multiple pregnancy rate, the fetal abnormality rate or the incidence of complications or adverse effects (for example ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). The number of oocytes retrieved was reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 12:08:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The overall methodological risk of bias of included trials was poor as none adhered to the CONSORT statement in full. See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Method of randomisation </I>
<BR/>All three studies mentioned the use of a randomisation scheme (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> study the randomisation process was simply described as "random and sequential". Attempts to contact the authors for clarification failed and we have assumed that this means that patients were sequentially randomised, that is allocated in sequence (as they were recruited) and at random.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK> study 110 women were randomised to treatment or control followed by IVF or ICSI, or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). The 63 women who received IUI were in a particular subgroup which was identifiable prior to randomisation. Therefore, excluding these women should not bias the results and we have decided to include only those participants who underwent IVF or ICSI (according to our inclusion criteria).</P>
<P>
<I>Concealment of allocation </I>
<BR/>None of the studies reported any form of allocation concealment. This casts doubt on whether or not selection bias was present in any of these trials and this must be kept in mind when analysing the results.</P>
<P>
<I>Study design </I>
<BR/>In all three studies no placebo was administered to the control group. Neither women nor physicians were blinded to treatment assignment.<BR/>Exclusion criteria were specified in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). In all three studies no sample size calculation was performed but appropriate statistical tests were used.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Intention-to -treat (ITT) </I>
<BR/>Only one study reported the number of women who dropped out from each group (<LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>). This study used an ITT analysis, including the dropouts as negative outcomes in the analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>) reported that a subgroup of women was deleted from the study. No details are given as to whether this deletion took place before or after randomisation and we did not receive clarification from the authors. We have assumed that it took place before randomisation as this subgroup was identifiable at the time of recruitment. In correspondence with the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> we have found that there were no dropouts after treatment was started.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<I>Birth rate </I>
<BR/>The live birth rate per couple/woman was not reported in any of the included studies. However, according to our pre-determined criteria women with a viable pregnancy (at least 24 weeks gestation) were included in this outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> reported 9 viable pregnancies for 67 women with an odds ratio of 9.19 (95% CI 1.08 to 79.22), clearly favouring treatment with GnRH over control. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Clinical pregnancy </I>
<BR/>The clinical pregnancy rate per woman was reported by the three studies, including 78 pregnancies for 165 women. The pooled odds ratio showed that this was significantly higher in women who received the GnRH agonist compared to the control group (OR 4.28, 95% CI 2.00 to 9.15). </P>
<P>
<I>Multiple pregnancy </I>
<BR/>The multiple pregnancy rate per pregnant woman was not reported by any of the studies. </P>
<P>
<I>Miscarriage </I>
<BR/>The miscarriage rate per clinically pregnant woman was reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> and there was no statistically significant difference between both groups (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.25). The rate of miscarriages per woman randomised showed no significant difference between groups. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Ectopic pregnancy</I> <BR/>The ectopic pregnancy rate per couple/woman was not reported by any of the studies. In correspondence with the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> it was determined that there were no ectopic pregnancies in this study. </P>
<P>
<I>Fetal abnormalities</I> <BR/>The fetal abnormalities rate per pregnant woman was not reported by any of the studies. In correspondence with the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> it was determined that there were no fetal abnormalities in this study. </P>
<P>
<I>Dose of FSH or HMG </I>
<BR/>The dose of HMG or FSH required was reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of ampoules required between women who received the GnRH agonist and those who did not (weighted mean difference 0.34, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.38). There was, however, heterogeneity between the studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 71%) with the individual results suggesting conflicting, although non-significant, effects. This may largely be due to the fact that the treatments delivered were not directly comparable (clinical heterogeneity) as treatment effects and interactions between the drugs delivered in 2002 are likely to differ considerably from those of the drugs delivered 10 years earlier (1992). <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Duration of FSH or HMG </I>
<BR/>The duration of HMG or FSH stimulation was reported by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>) and this showed that there was no significant difference between women who received the GnRH agonist compared to those who did not (WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.23). </P>
<P>
<I>Number of oocytes </I>
<BR/>The number of oocytes retrieved was reported by two studies (Dicker 1992; Surrey 2002). Meta-analysis showed that the number of oocytes retrieved was significantly higher in women who received the GnRH agonist compared to those who did not (WMD 0.94, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.51). However, this effect was almost exclusively due to Dicker 1992 where the treatment was clearly favoured, whereas no significant difference was suggested by Surrey 2002. <BR/>It is reasonable to assume that these discrepancies are due to the huge advances in assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in the ten-year period that separates these studies, in particular relating to oocyte retrieval techniques. We would therefore suggest that, for this outcome, these studies are not comparable due to clinical heterogeneity. </P>
<P>
<I>Number of embryos obtained and frozen </I>
<BR/>The number of embryos obtained and the number of embryos frozen were not reported in any of the studies and raw data could not be obtained from the authors. </P>
<P>
<I>Complication rate </I>
<BR/>The incidence of complications or adverse effects associated with the treatment was not reported in any of the studies. In correspondence the authors of Surrey 2002 clarified that they were not aware of any adverse outcomes or complications related to treatment. </P>
<P>As mentioned, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, in particular for dose of FSH or HMG and number of oocytes retrieved. Since only two to three studies were involved in the meta-analyses we decided to use the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic as an indicator of heterogeneity instead of the chi-squared test, which has low power when the number of included studies is small. <BR/> </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Women with endometriosis treated with IVF or ICSI have lower pregnancy rates compared to women with no endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Barnhart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnhart 2002</LINK>). Many treatment regimens have been suggested prior to performing assisted reproduction for these women. The present review confirms the fact that pretreatment of women with endometriosis with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for at least three months (and up to six months) prior to IVF or ICSI increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by at least four-fold. We have calculated that in order to elicit an increase in the pregnancy rate from 20% to 40%, accepting an 80% probability of finding a true difference and taking 5% as the level of statistical significance, a study should include a minimum of 79 women in each of its arms. The number of women analysed in this review were 88 participants who received the GnRH agonist and 77 controls. </P>
<P>Although some non-randomised studies have suggested that surgical removal of endometriomas prior to IVF or ICSI may affect the success rates, in this review we have seen that the clinical pregnancy rates obtained by <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>, where this removal was performed, were similar to those obtained by <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> where this was not done. </P>
<P>The improvement in the live birth and clinical pregnancy rates following long-term administration of GnRH agonist prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis may be due to an improvement in the quality of the oocytes (and hence the embryos) or to an improvement in the uterine receptivity leading to better implantation and diminished loss of very early pregnancies. Two of our selected studies reported no significant difference in the fertilization rate and the cleavage rate between women who received GnRH agonist and those who did not (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>). These findings point towards the endometrium rather than the oocyte being the cause of diminished pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis. However, these results cannot be relied upon as randomisation of the oocytes was not effected. These findings also contradict those of Pellicer et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 2001</LINK>) who found that when oocytes retrieved from women without known endometriosis were donated to women with and without endometriosis, embryo development and implantation rates were similar in both groups of women, and that women who received embryos derived from oocytes retrieved from women with endometriotic ovaries had a significantly reduced implantation rate compared to the controls (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 2001</LINK>). However, the Pellicer study was also not randomised and future randomised studies are needed to resolve this issue (with randomisation of donated oocytes). </P>
<P>In support of the latter theory, we have found that although there was no statistically significant difference in the dose or duration of HMG required for ovarian stimulation between the treatment and control groups, the number of oocytes retrieved was significantly higher in the GnRH agonist group. This could have led to a higher number of 'good' embryos to choose from as there was no significant difference in the number of embryos replaced in all three studies included in our meta-analysis between the treatment and control groups. This effect may have been particularly important in <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> as assisted reproduction therapies would be more dependent of the quality of oocytes then. In the <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> study there was no significant difference in the number of oocytes retrieved in the control and treatment groups and this is more likely to reflect current practice than <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>. Unfortunately, we could not determine whether the administration of the GnRH agonist increased the number of resulting embryos, due to the absence of the raw data. </P>
<P>In this review it was noticed that the two more recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>) reported higher clinical pregnancy rates (75% and 80%, respectively) than the earlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>). This is most probably due to the general improvement of the results of assisted reproduction that occurred worldwide along the span of the 10 years difference between the studies (including developments in ICSI), rather than for using the agonist for a shorter period (three months in the <LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK> study versus six months in <LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rickes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rickes 2002</LINK>) to prevent over-inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary complex. However, this point can only be resolved by a randomised study comparing both regimens of therapy. </P>
<P>Another point to notice is that in all studies women in the control group were started on the IVF protocol straight away, whereas women on the treatment group had a period of three to six months of treatment with GnRH agonist prior to starting stimulation for IVF. This may mean that the improved results in the treatment group are not only due to the treatment but may be confounded by the amount of time elapsed since surgery, and the fact that these women may be followed up for longer in the trial (three or six months plus IVF cycles, as opposed to just IVF cycles for women in the control group). A randomised study of GnRH agonist versus placebo before IVF or ICSI would help resolve this issue. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The overall message obtained from these three trials is that the administration of GnRH agonists for a period of three to six months prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by more than four-fold. The odds of live birth are also improved although, due to the poor quality of the only study reporting this (<LINK REF="STD-Dicker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dicker 1992</LINK>), the magnitude of this effect is unreliable. There were no significant differences in the number of FSH or HMG ampoules required between women who received the GnRH agonist and those who did not. </P>
<P>Due to the nature of the studies, information on the number of oocytes retrieved was inconclusive although the most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Surrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Surrey 2002</LINK>) suggests there is no significant difference between groups. </P>
<P>Whether the improvement in the pregnancy rate is due to the production of better oocytes (and hence embryos) or better endometrial receptivity cannot be determined as yet. Similarly, whether this therapy is equally beneficial for mild and severe stages of endometriosis and whether one type of agonist is superior to another cannot be determined from the present studies. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, and based on currently available evidence, women with endometriosis treated with IVF or ICSI should receive GnRH agonist therapy for a minimum of three months prior to the procedure as this will increase the odds of clinical pregnancy by four-fold, bearing in mind that data regarding adverse effects of this therapy on the mother or fetus are not available at present. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More randomised studies are needed as we have only found one properly randomised study which reported the ongoing (viable) pregnancy rate; and this was an old study which used drugs and techniques that do not reflect current practice. Future studies should be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and report the number of oocytes retrieved, the biochemical (preclinical) pregnancy rate and the miscarriage rate, the live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate as well as meet all <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT</LINK> requirements. Studies should also report the ectopic pregnancy rate, the multiple pregnancy rate and the presence of any complications to the women or congenital abnormalities in the fetus or newborn, as these four outcomes have not been reported by any randomised study so far. Women should also be stratified according to the stage of endometriosis. Comparisons between different types of GnRH agonists and length of the course of treatment (three versus six months) as well as comparisons using placebo are also needed. </P>
<P>There is also a need for research into the mechanism of action of GnRH agonist leading to these improved pregnancy rates. This will require studies on the quality of the oocytes and endometrial receptivity before and after the therapy. The oocyte donation model is an ideal model for such research, with proper randomisation of donated oocytes. </P>

</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>51 infertile patients with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy or laparotomy within 60 months of cycle initiation (range 2 to 55 months): 25 received GnRH agonist for 3 months before IVF/ICSI and 26 controls received no GnRH agonist before IVF/ICSI.<BR/>The authors reported no significant differences between both groups in terms of age, early follicular phase serum FSH or oestradiol level, interval between the most recent surgical intervention and cycle onset, surgical technique used or endometriosis score. However, a significantly greater proportion of women receiving the GnRH agonist had stages III and IV endometriosis (revised ASRM classification) compared to the control group. <BR/>Exclusion criteria were an early follicular phase serum FSH &gt;12 mIU/ml and evidence of ovarian endometrioma.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 12:05:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Study group: IM injections of 3.75 mg luprolide acetate (Lupron Depot, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Waukegan, IL) every 28 days for a total of 3 injections. After 30 to 45 days of the last injection leuprolide acetate (TAP Pharmaceuticals) 0.5 to 1.0 mg/d SC was started and given for 10 days. The dose of GnRh agonist was then reduced to 0.25-0.50 mg/d and gonadotrophin stimulation started. Control group: GnRh agonist started 0.5 - 1.0 mg/d SC during the mid-luteal phase. Once gonadotrophin suppression was confirmed, the dose was reduced to 0.25 to 0.5 mg/d SC and exogenous gonadotrophin stimulation was initiated.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Dose of HMG required, number of days of HMG stimulation, number of oocytes obtained, fertilization rate, number of embryos transferred, ongoing pregnancy rate, implantation rate per cycle started, implantation rate per embryo transfer procedure.<BR/>Main outcome measures were the clinical pregnancy rate, the implantation rate and the biochemical pregnancy rate.<BR/>Only one cycle was included for each woman.</P>
