<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Weight gain and obesity is a common problem for people with schizophrenia and both pharmacological (medication) and non pharmacological (diet/exercise) interventions have been tried to treat this problem. In this review we are able to show that small weight loss is possible with selective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions but it is difficult to be sure of the results because the studies were small and compared different interventions over different time periods.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia and this has serious implications for health and well being.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of both pharmacological (excluding medication switching) and non pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (April 2006), reference sections within relevant papers, hand searched key journals, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all clinical randomised controlled trials comparing any pharmacological or non pharmacological intervention for weight gain (diet and exercise counselling) with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from studies. As weight is a continuous outcome measurement, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. The primary outcome measure was weight loss.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five trials assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen assessed a pharmacological adjunct. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect (mean weight change) at end of treatment (n=104, 2 RCTs, WMD -3.38 kg CI -4.2 to -2.0). Pharmacological adjunct treatments were significant with a modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD - 1.16 kg CI -1.9 to -0.4). In terms of treatments for weight loss, we found significantly greater weight reduction in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (n=129, 3 RCTs, WMD -1.69 kg CI -2.8 to -0.6) compared with standard care.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Modest weight loss can be achieved with selective pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, short study duration and by variability of the interventions themselves, their intensity and duration. Future studies adequately powered, with longer treatment duration and rigorous methodology will be needed in further evaluating the efficacy and safety of weight loss interventions for moderating weight gain. At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Obesity and schizophrenia<BR/>Obesity is a common problem for people with schizophrenia, a problem that has been exacerbated more recently with the increased use of second generation antipsychotics, many of which are associated with the risk of weight gain and metabolic disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Casey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of obesity in people with schizophrenia has been reported to be anywhere from one and a half to four times higher than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-ADA_x002f_APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA/APA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coodin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coodin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1988</LINK>). For people with schizophrenia, there is a marked increase in standardized mortality ratios for both natural and unnatural causes of death and much of this increment may be attributed to the increased prevalence of coronary heart disease risk (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saari-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saari 2005</LINK>), and related obesity in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Coodin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coodin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daumit-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daumit 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Susce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Susce 2005</LINK>). The significance and recognition of this prevalence and its impact on premature mortality and morbidity has led to the development of recent consensus statements on its management (<LINK REF="REF-ADA_x002f_APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA/APA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Nayer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Nayer 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mechanisms of weight gain in schizophrenia<BR/>It is difficult to identify the relative contributions of disease-specific factors such as genetics, the side effects of medications, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical inactivity on the prevalence of obesity in schizophrenia. In a meta-analysis, every antipsychotic medication except ziprasidone and molindone was associated with some degree of weight gain after just ten weeks of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1999</LINK>). The effects were greatest with olanzapine and clozapine which increased body weight by approximately 4 to 4.5 kilograms. To date, there is no consensus on what pharmacological factors may be involved in this weight gain particularly regarding the newer antipsychotics. Ananth and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ananth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 2004</LINK>) have reviewed a range of potential weight-inducing mechanisms such as dopaminergic blockage; increased appetite due to the interaction of antipsychotic medication with dopamine, serotonin, and histamine neuronal receptors; increased leptin; and increases in systemic levels of various cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors. The relative receptor affinities of the novel antipsychotics for histamine H1 appear to be a consistent correlate of antipsychotic-related weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Kroeze-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroeze 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirshing 1999</LINK>). It is important to note however that obesity was commonly reported before antipsychotics were widely introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Baptista-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baptista 2002</LINK>). In terms of lifestyle factors, physical activity is one important component of weight management and research consistently demonstrates that people with schizophrenia are less physically active than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daumit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daumit 2005</LINK>). Similarly, research suggests that people with schizophrenia have a diet high in fat and low in fibre and vitamins (<LINK REF="REF-McCreadie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCreadie 1998</LINK>), and consume more calories than population controls (<LINK REF="REF-Strassnig-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strassnig 2003a</LINK>). As with the general population, the aetiology of obesity appears complex and multifactorial. Consequently, intervention strategies must also target a broad range of factors that may contribute to weight gain in this population.</P>
<P>Health effects of obesity <BR/>Obesity doubles the risk of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, increases the risk of some cancers, musculoskeletal problems and loss of function, and carries negative psychological consequences (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2004</LINK>). Being an obese or overweight adult is associated with large decreases in life expectancy and increases in early mortality in recent US population data, and these decreases are similar to those seen with smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Peeters-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 2003</LINK>). The burden of obesity in schizophrenia will be at least comparable in terms of premature mortality and morbidity, and is likely to have important deleterious effects on mortality and health (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Quality of life is further reduced for people with schizophrenia with high body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-Strassnig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strassnig 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurzthaler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurzthaler 2001</LINK>) and those gaining weight (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Weiden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiden 2004</LINK> reported a significant, positive association between obesity, subjective distress from weight gain and medication non-compliance in a sample of people with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia face the combined challenges of living with the illness, and for many, obesity and related illnesses. This combination is a major public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Wirshing-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirshing 2004</LINK>) and carries considerable human cost. Recognition of this has lead to growing concern with how best to intervene (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Fevre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Fevre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Catapana-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catapana 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of obesity in the general population<BR/>The treatment of obesity consists of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Current guidelines state that non-pharmacological interventions should always be used before, and then in conjunction with the latter (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2005</LINK>). In terms of non-pharmacological interventions, strategies should combine diet, exercise and psychological/behavioural components. In a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2005</LINK>), cognitive-behaviour therapy, when combined with a diet/exercise intervention, was found to increase weight loss compared with diet/exercise alone by 4.9 kg (CI -7.3 to -2.4). Behaviour therapy alone was found to result in significantly greater weight loss (-2.5 kg) than placebo when assessed as a stand-alone weight loss strategy (CI -1.7 to -3.3). Bariatric surgery could be considered as a treatment option for patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or greater, and who have failed an adequate lifestyle modification programme (with or without adjunctive pharmacological therapy) (see <LINK REF="REF-Hamoui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamoui 2004</LINK> in the context of schizophrenia).</P>
<P>Pharmacological interventions can be divided into two broad categories (<LINK REF="REF-Padwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padwal 2004</LINK>). The first includes inhibitors of intestinal fat absorption (orlistat). The second acts to suppress appetite, increase satiety, or increase thermogenesis by modifying central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin (sibutramine). One meta-analysis of anti-obesity agents found that average weight losses compared to placebo were modest and never exceeded four kilograms for any one agent (<LINK REF="REF-Haddock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddock 2002</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Padwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padwal 2004</LINK>) of long term interventions reported that orlistat treated patients lost 2.7 kilograms (CI -2.3 kg to -3.1 kg) more weight than placebo while sibutramine-treated patients lost 4.3 kilograms (CI -3.6 kg to -4.9 kg) more weight than placebo.</P>
<P>Overall, existing evidence suggests that even effective treatments for adult obesity only produce modest weight loss (approximately 2-5 kg) compared to no treatment or usual care. One implication of this finding is that the best treatment of obesity is its prevention. However, modest weight loss is a worthwhile outcome of interventions. There is evidence that loss of body weight by as little as 5-10% may reduce some of the health risks associated with adult obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Wilding-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilding 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, sustained changes in health behaviours as a result of such interventions, e.g., increased levels of physical activity, may reduce risk of mortality and morbidity independent of any weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 1999</LINK>). Increasing levels of physical activity are also associated with a range of mental health benefits in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevention and treatment of obesity in schizophrenia<BR/>Given such modest weight loss in studies in the adult population, it might be expected that interventions may be difficult for people with schizophrenia given the range of social and cognitive difficulties associated with the illness. There are at least four systematic reviews examining behavioural interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Werneke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werneke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loh 2006</LINK>), pharmacological interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Werneke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werneke 2002</LINK>), or both (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2003</LINK>). This Cochrane review updates and extends these recent reviews by focusing on evidence from randomised controlled trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of <I>both</I> pharmacological (excluding antipsychotic medication switching) and non-pharmacological strategies (diet/exercise) for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We sought all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was only implied that the study was randomised, these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials were used and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included people diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses, using any criteria. Trials were included where it was implied that the majority (&gt;50%) of the participants had a severe mental illness likely to be schizophrenia. Trials were not excluded due to age, nationality or sex of participants. Trials were included with participants with any length of illness who were being treated in any treatment setting.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Weight loss (treatment) and weight maintenance (prevention) studies evaluating pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic adjunctive interventions were included in this review. To be included in the review, the primary outcome of the trial had to be weight loss or maintenance. In this review we do not focus on interventions examining the switching of antipsychotic medication.</P>
<P>1. Prevention of weight gain<BR/>1.1 Non pharmacological interventions<BR/>All types of non pharmacological interventions were considered for inclusion. Typically, interventions incorporate dietary and/or exercise components. Additionally, some studies may include cognitive/behavioural components. These treatments attempt to enhance dietary restraint by providing adaptive dietary strategies and by discouraging maladaptive dietary practices, and by increasing motivation to be more physically active (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2005</LINK>). Studies were considered based on the following subcategories:</P>
<P>1.1.1 Cognitive/behavioural intervention versus standard care. These referred to studies promoting changes in diet and/or physical activity including elements of cognitive and/or behavioural modification;</P>
<P>1.1.2. Exercise/dietary intervention versus standard care. These referred to studies promoting changes in diet and/or physical activity without elements of cognitive and/or behavioural modification.</P>
<P>1.2 Pharmacological interventions<BR/>All types of adjunctive pharmacological interventions were considered for inclusion. At this stage, we have included:</P>
<P>1.2.1 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - currently licensed for use as a weight loss agent (sibutramine; orlistat);</P>
<P>1.2.2 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - off-label therapy (fluoxetine, topiramate, metformin);</P>
<P>1.2.3 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - withdrawn from the market (fenfluramine, phenylpropanolamine).</P>
<P>1.3 Standard care<BR/>We defined this as care that a person would normally receive had they not been included in the research trial.</P>
<P>2. Treatment of weight gain<BR/>2.1 Non pharmacological interventions<BR/>2.1.1 Cognitive/Behavioural intervention versus standard care. These referred to studies promoting changes in diet and/or physical activity including elements of cognitive and/or behavioural modification;</P>
<P>2.1.2. Exercise/dietary intervention versus standard care. These referred to studies promoting changes in diet and/or physical activity without elements of cognitive and/or behavioural modification.</P>
<P>2.2 Pharmacological interventions</P>
<P>2.2.1 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - currently licensed somewhere for use as weight loss agents (sibutramine, orlistat);</P>
<P>2.2.2 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - off-label therapy (fluoxetine, topiramate, metformin); </P>
<P>2.2.3 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments - withdrawn from the market (fenfluramine, phenylpropanolamine).</P>
<P>2.3 Standard care<BR/>We defined this as care that a person would normally receive had they not been included in the research trial.</P>

<P>2. We searched registers of ongoing clinical trials. </P>
<P>3. Reference searching. <BR/>We inspected reference list of all identified studies, including existing reviews for relevant citations. Additionally, we hand searched copies of the following journals (from January 2000 to April 2006): Journal of Clinical Psychiatry; British Journal of Psychiatry; Schizophrenia Bulletin; Schizophrenia Research; Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology; Psychiatric Services and the American Journal of Psychiatry. Finally, conference proceedings of the American Psychiatric Association (personal records), Society of Biological Psychiatry (published in Biological Psychiatry), the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (published in European Neuropsychopharmacology), the Collegium Internationale Neuro-psychopharmacologicum (published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology) and the International Congress on Schizophrenia Research (published in Schizophrenia Research) were hand searched.</P>
<P>4. Personal contact<BR/>We contacted the first author of each relevant study for information on unpublished trials. Experts in the area of schizophrenia and weight gain were also consulted. Authors and experts were contacted by e-mail or post to establish missing details in the methods and results sections of the written reports and to determine their knowledge of or involvement in any current work in the area. Contacts at major pharmaceutical companies were also asked if they have conducted or were currently undertaking any weight-related interventions in relation to schizophrenia (including representatives from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer Inc, Eli Lilly and Company, Astra Zeneca, and Bristol-Myers Squibb).</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We (GF, TC, GR) independently assessed the abstracts from the trial searches. Any disagreements were discussed and reported and if consensus could not be reached we obtained the full report and repeated the assessment process until agreement was reached.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Two reviewers (GF and TC) independently assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials. </P>
<P>This classification was planned as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. </P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>GF independently extracted data from selected trials, while TC separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis <BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example, changes in weight), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's weight). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we were unable to analyse these.</P>
<P>4.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We assumed that participants who left before study completion e.g. withdrawn by an investigator or left of their own volition, for binary outcomes, to have had a negative outcome. We tested the effects of this assignment in a sensitivity analysis. For continuous data it is impossible to manage the data in this way therefore we presented 'completer' data. </P>
<P>4.3 Binary data<BR/>When summation was appropriate, with binary outcomes such as improved/not improved, we calculated the relative risk (RR) statistic with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and used a fixed effects model. </P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Normally distributed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. </P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Again, without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. </P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again this was based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. We did not consider continuous data presented without use of summary statistics (i.e. mean, SD, SE, median, interquartile range), although we noted the existence of these data in the description of included studies.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Rating scales<BR/>Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. </P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported endpoint data.</P>
<P>4.3 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we undertook consideration of all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented the data separately and investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>We compared the results for high doses (however 'high' was defined in the study) to those for lower doses with regard to the primary outcome of weight loss or maintenance. </P>
<P>8. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the weight management treatment.</P>

<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>Four studies await assessment. We have sought further information from <LINK REF="STD-Ganguli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganguli 2005</LINK> but authors have not responded to our requests and that study remains in awaiting assessment. We identified three studies after completion of this version of the review, and we will incorporate these into following reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Jimenez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Jimenez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKibbin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McKibbin 2006</LINK>).<I> </I>
</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>Two trials are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bristol_x002d_Meyer-Squib" TYPE="STUDY">Bristol-Meyer Squib</LINK>, see table of Ongoing studies).</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We included twenty-three randomised controlled trials. Five assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen a pharmacological adjunct. All but two studies were published from 2002 onward which reflects the recent recognition of weight gain as a significant clinical concern.</P>
<P>4.1 Methods<BR/>All trials were randomised. The five cognitive/behavioural studies were not double-blind due to the inherent difficulties involved in disguising psychosocial interventions. All pharmacological interventions were double-blind except for two studies which were open (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topirimate-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Topirimate 2006</LINK>). The duration of the trials ranged between six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>) and twenty-four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>). The average duration was approximately twelve weeks.</P>
<P>4.2 Participants and setting<BR/>All trials included people diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform psychosis and the majority employed DSM-IV criteria for diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria was not reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>) while diagnosis was obtained by chart records in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>) and detailed 'psychiatric interview' in another (<LINK REF="STD-D_x002d_Fenfluramine-1988" TYPE="STUDY">D-Fenfluramine 1988</LINK>). Two studies explicitly targeted first-episode patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>). Over 1000 participants were included with slightly more male than female participants included (where described). Participants were aged between 18 and 64 with a mean age of approximately 36 years. When data were provided (in fourteen studies), the mean BMI of the participants at baseline was approximately 29 kg/m2. When data were provided (in fifteen studies), the mean weight of the participants at baseline was approximately 80 kg.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Eleven trials included only outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x002d_Fenfluramine-1988" TYPE="STUDY">D-Fenfluramine 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topirimate-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Topirimate 2006</LINK>), seven trials only inpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topiramate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Topiramate 2005</LINK>), and five involved both inpatients and outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>Most studies were small (mean number randomised 45) and ranged between 14 and 171 participants.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions - Prevention<BR/>Nine trials were preventive interventions i.e. the attenuation of weight gain. </P>
<P>4.5.1 Non pharmacological Interventions<BR/>Two trials included a cognitive/behavioural intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>). In the first trial, the intervention group attended a weekly, one-hour psychoeducation class using "Solutions of Wellness" modules incorporating nutrition and exercise material for 16 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>). Modules involved individual and group work with written exercises, tests and discussions. Learning objectives of the material included setting realistic goals, learning appropriate serving sizes, developing support systems, initiating and maintaining an exercise program and learning low-cost and no-cost exercise strategies. In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>), the intervention group received six one-on-one individual nutrition education sessions over a three month period. Each session lasted one hour and included discussions on healthy eating, exercise, label reading, energy density, high fibre diets, non-hungry eating and maintenance of healthy eating and changes in activity levels. Goals for healthy eating and lifestyle change were set, reviewed and revised on a fortnightly basis. </P>
<P>4.5.2 Pharmacological Interventions<BR/>The remaining trials focused on a range of pharmacological adjuncts for attenuating weight gain including famotidine, nizatidine, fluoxetine, reboxetine, metformin, topiramate, and fluvoxamine. <BR/>Famotidine is an H2 antagonist that has been associated with the attenuation of weight gain. Nizatidine is another H2 receptor antagonist which has been implicated in weight loss. Fluoxetine induces stimulation of the 5-HT2C receptor, implicated in weight gain, which may compensate for olanzapine's antagonistic activity at these same receptors. Reboxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Metformin is an anti-diabetic agent that has been found to be beneficial in decreasing weight and improving insulin sensitivity. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication that has been used in a variety of other conditions, including bipolar affective disorder, migraine and neuropathic pain it has been reported to induce weight loss, although the mechanism is not well understood. Fluvoxamine is an add-on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) which has been used adjunctively with clozapine to enhance therapeutic response with regards to depressive or negative symptomatology. The co-administration of this agent may accelerate clozapine-induced increases in plasma leptin levels and decrease plasma norclozapine/clozapine ratios. Norclozapine may be primarily responsible for weight gain. </P>
<P>Poyurovsky and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>) examined the effect of famotidine on preventing weight gain in first episode people. In a small study of fourteen patients taking olanzapine (10 mg/day), participants were randomised to receive either famotidine (40 mg/day) or placebo for six weeks. Cavazonni and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>) evaluated the efficacy of two fixed doses (150 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg b.i.d.) of nizatidine for sixteen weeks. Participants received open label olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day). Poyurovsky and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>) examined whether the co administration of fluoxetine (20 mg/day) prevented or attenuated olanzapine-induced (10 mg/day) weight gain in people with first-episode schizophrenia. Poyurovsky and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>) examined its addition for preventing weight gain in participants during six weeks of olanzapine treatment (10 mg/day). Participants were randomly allocated to receive reboxetine (4 mg/day) or placebo. Baptista and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>) randomised patients taking olanzapine (10 mg/day) to a treatment group which received 850-1750 mg/day metformin or a placebo group for fourteen weeks. Kim and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Topirimate-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Topirimate 2006</LINK>) examined its addition for olanzapine treated patients (~ 12 mg/day). The treatment group received topiramate (25 mg b.i.d for eight days then a fixed dose to 50 mg b.i.d. to 12 weeks). Lu and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>) randomly assigned patients to a 12 week treatment group which received fluvoxamine (50 mg/day) plus low-dose clozapine (&lt; 250 mg/day), or a monotherapy group which received clozapine (&lt; 600 mg/day).</P>
<P>4.5.3 Standard Care<BR/>In all trials, standard care included treatment with antipsychotic medication. In one study, the standard care group received passive nutritional education from a booklet (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>). In the metformin study, both groups received a balanced diet (2500-3000 KCal daily) during the fourteen-week trial (<LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.6 Interventions - Treatment<BR/>Fourteen trials involved treatments for weight loss.</P>
<P>4.6.1 Non pharmacological Interventions<BR/>Three trials examined cognitive/behavioural interventions. In the trial reported by Ganguli and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>), participants were treated with olanzapine and randomly assigned to a 14-week behavioural weight loss treatment group or standard care. The treatment group received two therapy sessions per week for six weeks and then one session per week for eight weeks (a total of 20 sessions). In these sessions, a range of weight loss techniques were taught, including self-monitoring of weight and food consumed, modifying urges to overeat, slowing the pace of eating, and changing snacking habits. Only two sessions covered exercise. Techniques were rehearsed by the participants, and were demonstrated with food models when appropriate. In a pilot study of a group intervention modified after the Diabetes Prevention Project (DPP), Weber and Wyne (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006a</LINK>) randomly assigned patients to a cognitive/behavioural intervention group or standard care. The treatment group consisted of one-hour group sessions each week for sixteen weeks. Each session included activities such as role play, goal setting, problem solving, discussion of barriers to change, presentations on low-fat diets and developing plans to increase activities such as walking. A food and activity diary was kept and reviewed at each session. In the study reported by Kwon and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>), olanzapine-treated patients were randomly allocated to a weight management program or standard care. Individual sessions were held once a week for the first four weeks and then every two weeks up to the end of treatment at week 12. Diet management included a food diary and nutritional education. A dietician reviewed and discussed the food diaries and helped with diet planning. Patients were also educated about nutrition concepts using food models including healthy snacking, low-calorie cooking preparation and food shopping. Exercise management included the keeping of an exercise diary and education regarding lifestyle modification. An exercise coordinator reviewed and discussed the diaries with the patients and helped patients plan exercise. Education included explanations of calorie consumption in daily activities, choosing suitable exercise, and using the community health centre.</P>
<P>4.6.2 Pharmacological interventions<BR/>The remaining eleven trials focused on a range of pharmacological adjuncts for attenuating weight gain including amantadine, d-fenfluramine, dextroamphetamine sulfate, fluoxetine, nizatidine, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine and topiramate. </P>
<P>Amantadine is a dopamine agonist that is used for the treatment of extrapyramidal side-effects associated with antipsychotic drugs. Its ability to modify dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission may in turn produce weight-reducing effects. Two trials examined the adjunctive use of amantadine. In the trial reported by Deberdt and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>), olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) was co-adminstered with 100-300 mg/day amantadine or placebo. Graham and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005b</LINK>) similarly assigned olanzapine treated patients to up to 300 mg/day amantadine or placebo for 12 weeks. </P>
<P>Goodall (<LINK REF="STD-D_x002d_Fenfluramine-1988" TYPE="STUDY">D-Fenfluramine 1988</LINK>) examined the efficacy of d-fenfluramine, an anorectic drug (since removed from the market), in treating weight gain during a 12-week trial. All patients were receiving a 'regular' dose of depot antipsychotic medication - fluphenazine decanoate, flupenthixol decanoate, or clopenthixol decanoate, and those with a BMI  27 were randomised to receive 30 mg/day of d-fenfluramine or placebo. All participants received dietary advice throughout the 12-week trial. </P>
<P>Dextroamphetamine sulfate is an isomer of amphetamine which has been used as a central nervous system stimulant to help treat narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Interest in its potential anorectic effect lead Model and Hussar (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>) to examine whether 5 mg/daily of this agent promoted weight loss over eight weeks compared to a placebo.</P>
<P>Bustillo and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>) examined 60 mg/day doses of fluoxetine in treating patients who had gained &gt; 3% of their baseline weight in the first 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment.</P>
<P>In two studies, Atmaca and colleagues investigated the efficacy of 150 mg/day nizatidine on the treatment of olanzapine-induced (mean daily dose = 15.3 mg/day) weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>) and quetiapine-induced (mean daily dose = 504.4 mg/day) weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Phenylpropanolamine is a synthetic catecholamine appetite suppressant which has been removed from the market. Borovicka and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>) conducted a 12-week trial of PPA in treating outpatients who were stable on clozapine treatment (PPA, clozapine mean dosage = 506  115 mg; placebo, clozapine mean dosage = 431  187 kg) for at least four months and had gained &gt; 10% of their baseline body weight since starting treatment on this antipsychotic. Participants were randomised to receive PPA 75 mg/daily or placebo. All patients also attended mandatory monthly sessions of dietary counselling. </P>
<P>Sibutramine, approved for the long-term treatment of obesity, inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and was introduced into the US market in 1997. Henderson and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>) conducted a 12-week trial of sibutramine addition (up to 15mg) in patients treated on a stable dose of olanzapine. In an unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK>), Weiden and colleagues conducted a 16-week trial of sibutramine (up to 15 mg) in outpatients maintained on a stable dose of an antipsychotic for at least three months. Patients were randomised to sibutramine treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and all received dietary counselling weekly for four weeks and then every other week. </P>
<P>Ko and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Topiramate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Topiramate 2005</LINK>), in a 12-week trial, added topiramate to the participants daily dose of atypical antipsychotics. Patients were randomised to receive topiramate, titrated to two dosage endpoints (100 mg or 200 mg) over 12 weeks, or placebo. </P>
<P>4.6.3 Standard Care<BR/>In all trials, standard care included treatment with antipsychotic medication. There was wide variation in the described nature of the standard care received by patients. All patients received nutritional counselling in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK>) or access to a healthy lifestyle education program and a three month membership to a gym or commercial weight-loss program in one (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005b</LINK>). Standard care could also consist of no advice on weight reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>) or verbal recommendations regarding exercise and diet (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>). In one study, all patients participated in weekly group support consisting of weight education and behaviour modification for the first 8 weeks of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.7 Outcomes<BR/>Much data were collected in studies and reported in ways that made them unusable for the purpose of this review. Much data were lost due to studies failing to report appropriate measures of central tendency and deviation. Several studies presented findings in graphs which prevented data extraction. No data were reported regarding cost. Most studies reported on some type of continuous data for weight assessment. Final total body weight (kg) was extracted in twelve trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>). Change in weight from baseline to endpoint was extracted in all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>.

No studies reported change in percent body fat.</P>
<P>In terms of binary data, trials reported the number of patients with &gt;5% weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>), or &gt; 7% weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>) or &gt; 10% weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>). Alternatively, trials reported the number of patients gaining &gt;7% of initial weight (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>) or the number of patients with weight stabilization or weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8. Outcome scales: details of the only scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section.</P>
<P>4.8.1 Global state<BR/>4.8.1.1 Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>Trialists used this to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. Five trials reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.1.2 Global Assessment of Functioning - GAF (<LINK REF="REF-Frances-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frances 1995</LINK>)<BR/>The Global Assessment of Functioning, or GAF scale, is a numeric scale (0 through 100) used to rate the social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults and was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.1.3 Global Assessment Scale - GAS (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This scale rates people from 0-100 on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health (high = good). One trial reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.2 Satisfaction with care<BR/>4.8.2.1 Client Satisfaction Questionnaire - CSQ-8 (<LINK REF="REF-Attkisson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attkisson 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This is an eight-item self-rated questionnaire for patients to assess their satisfaction with a provided service. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.3 Mental state <BR/>4.8.3.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. Three trials reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.3.2 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) <BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondria, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. High scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms. Three trials reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>4.8.3.3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A lower score indicates lesser severity. Six trials reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.3.4 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of the following negative symptoms; alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Four studies reported data using this instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.3.5 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This scale measures the positive symptoms of psychosis and usable data was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.3.6 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale - MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>)<BR/>A 65-item comprehensive psychopathology scale was used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness. Ratings are based on 10 items, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. This depression rating scale is designed to be sensitive to change. Maximum score is 30. One study reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.4 Adverse effects scales<BR/>4.8.4.1 Barnes Akathisia Scale - BAS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The scale comprises items rating the observed, restless movements that characterise akathisia, a subjective awareness of restlessness, and any distress associated with the condition. These items are rated from 0 - normal to 3 - severe. In addition, there is an item for rating global severity (from 0 - absent to 5 - severe). A low score indicates low levels of akathisia. Two studies reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.4.2 Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This ten-item scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. Four studies reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.4.3 Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Munetz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munetz 1988</LINK>)<BR/>AIMS is a 12-item instrument assessing abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs, such as tardive dystonia and chronic akathisia, as well as 'spontaneous' motor disturbance related to the illness itself. Scoring the AIMS consists of rating the severity of movement in three main anatomic areas (facial/oral, extremities, and trunk), based on a five-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). Two trials reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.4.4 Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>)<BR/>The UKU rates four major topics: psychological side effects (10 items), neurological side effects (eight items), autonomic side effects (11 items) and other side effects (19 items). Each item is defined by means of a four-point scale where zero means not/doubtfully present. Scoring range is 0-144. One trial reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.4.5 Hillside Akathisia Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischhacker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischhacker 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The Hillside Akathisia Scale (HAS) has two subjective and three objective items for which anchored rating points are provided. One trial reported data using this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>The majority of trials reported number of people leaving the trial early. This excluded studies where there was no dropout reported (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>). One trial reported this data in graph form (no extractable data) (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>) and another trial did not distinguish between treatment and placebo patients who withdrew from the study (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.6 Other outcome measures<BR/>4.8.6.1 Cardiovascular measures.<BR/>Several trials reported blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>), heart rate (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>) and pulse (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.6.2 Laboratory measures.<BR/>Metabolic-related laboratory measures were of particular interest. Extractable data regarding laboratory measures included abnormal values of high cholesterol, trigylcerides and glucose (<LINK REF="STD-Amantadine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Amantadine 2005</LINK>); fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>); glucose, insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol (<LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>), serum leptin (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>) and lipids, glucose, uric acid, cortisol and haemoglobin A1<SUB>c</SUB>(<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.6.3 Compliance.<BR/>Three cognitive/behavioural intervention trials reported data for compliance with the weight management programme (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.6.4 Sleep/appetite<BR/>Data were extracted regarding sleep and appetite outcomes in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.8.7 Unusable data<BR/>Much data were collected in studies and reported in ways that made them unusable for the purpose of this review. Much data were lost due to studies failing to report appropriate measures of central tendency and deviation. Several studies presented findings in graphs which prevented data extraction.</P>
<P>4.8.8 Missing outcomes<BR/>We found no usable outcomes for specific quality of life measures. One study reported assessing this outcome but numerical data were not presented (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2006b</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were reported as randomised. However most of the included studies did not explicitly describe the methods used. Only four trials gave some indication of the randomisation process used. For example, a computer-generated randomisation code was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topiramate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Topiramate 2005</LINK>) while two trials reported allocating according to entries of a table of random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Dextroamphetam-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Dextroamphetam 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK>). Concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jni 2001</LINK>). Given that at least one quality criterion was not met or unclear in all studies, we classified all studies as at least having a moderate risk of bias (category B, see methods section). Analyses based on methodological quality were not conducted.</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Five cognitive/behavioural studies were not double-blind due to the inherent difficulties involved in disguising psychosocial interventions. This may exaggerate estimates of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2004</LINK>). All pharmacological interventions were double-blind except for two studies which were open (<LINK REF="STD-Fluvoxamine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fluvoxamine 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topirimate-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Topirimate 2006</LINK>). None of the studies reported any test of blinding. </P>

<P>4. Data reporting <BR/>Data were often poorly reported and could not be used. Outcomes were often presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as inexact p-values which we could not include. Many studies failed to provide standard deviations when reporting mean changes. We are seeking further data from the first authors of relevant trials.</P>

<P>10.7 Leaving the study early<BR/>The number of participants leaving the study early did not reveal any significant differences between cognitive behavioural interventions and standard care (n=137, 3 RCTs, RR 0.13 CI -0.01 to 0.3) during medium term assessment.</P>
<P>11. TREATMENT COMPARISON 2: ANTI OBESITY AGENTS +/- LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT versus PLACEBO +/- LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT <BR/>Two medium term trials were included in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>11.1 Weight <BR/>11.1.1 Total body weight<BR/>We found data favoured the treatment group who had a significantly lower mean weight (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD -16.96 CI -27.0 to -6.9) compared with participants given placebo and lifestyle management.</P>
<P>11.1.2 Change in weight<BR/>We found change in weight favoured the treatment group, but data are heterogeneous and we analysed the trials separately. We found data from <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK> favoured the treatment group who lost significantly more weight (n=37, WMD -4.58, CI -5.2 to -4.0). We found no significant difference in weight change between the treatment and placebo groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005b</LINK> study.</P>
<P>11.1.3 Total BMI <BR/>We found Body Mass Index to be significantly lower in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD -9.00 CI -13.5 to -4.5) compared with the placebo group.</P>
<P>11.1.3 Change in BMI<BR/>No significant differences were found in BMI change scores at end of treatment (n=41, 2 RCTs, WMD -0.17 CI -1.3 to 1.0) </P>
<P>11.1.4 Waist circumference <BR/>Waist circumference measurements were significantly lower in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD -11.50 CI -17.8 to -5.2) compared with placebo.</P>
<P>11.1.5 Change in waist circumference<BR/>We found change scores in waist circumference were not significantly different between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=22, WMD -7.60 CI -18.9 to 3.7).</P>
<P>11.1.6 Waist-hip ratio<BR/>There were no significant differences in final waist-hip ratio between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD 0.04 CI -0.02 to 0.10) compared with placebo.</P>
<P>11.1.7 Change in waist-hip ratio<BR/>We found change in waist-hip ratio at during medium term assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>) were almost statistically significant in favour of the treatment group (n=22, WMD 0.13 CI 0.00 to 0.3, p=0.05).</P>
<P>11.1.8 Hip circumference<BR/>We found the treatment group to have a significantly lower hip circumference than the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD -8.60 CI -15.2 to -2.0) by three months assessment.</P>
<P>11.1.9 Body fat (%)<BR/>At the end of treatment, we found no significant differences between groups in terms of body fat (%) (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, WMD 0.10 CI -3.4 to 3.6).</P>
<P>11.2 Global state - GAS<BR/>We found data from the Global Assessment Scale were equivocal (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, RR-1.50 CI -6.2 to 3.2)</P>
<P>11.3 Mental state - PANSS/SANS<BR/>The PANSS total endpoint scores at 12 weeks assessment were equivocal (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>, n=37, RR 1.10 CI -4.5 to 6.7). Similarly, we found negative symptom scores (SANS) (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>) were not significantly different. </P>
<P>11.4 Extrapyramidal symptoms<BR/>The Hillside Akathisia Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used by <LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK> to measure extrapyramidal symptoms but data are skewed.</P>
<P>11.5 Adverse effects<BR/>A greater number of adverse events were reported by patients taking sibutramine (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>) (see analyses figures) but these differences were not significant. In terms of satiety, sibutramine patients were not more likely to report excessive appetite (n=36, RR 0.45 CI 0.1 to 1.5) or excessive thirst (n=36, RR 2.24 CI 0.5 to 10.1). Regarding adverse effects related to sleep, no significant differences emerged in terms of difficulty falling asleep (n=36, RR 1.25 CI 0.5 to 3.2) or interrupted sleep (n=36, RR 4.47 CI 0.6 to 34.6). Similarly reports of blurred vision (n=36, RR 2.68 CI 0.3 to 23.4), constipation (n=36, RR 2.24 CI 0.5 to 10.1), dry mouth (n=36, RR 3.58 CI 0.9 to 14.6) and rapid heart rate (n=36, RR 1.79 CI 0.2 to 18.0) were non-significant.<BR/>

</B>11.6 Cardiovascular measures<BR/>We found systolic (n=37, WMD 9.90 mm Hg, CI 1.2 to 18.6) and diastolic (n=37, WMD 6.10 mm Hg CI 0.1 to 12.1) blood pressure favoured the control group compared with anti-obesity drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK>). No significant differences were found in heart rate (n=37, WMD 2.90 bpm CI -4.8 to 10.6).</P>
<P>11.7 Laboratory data<BR/>There were few clinically significant changes in haematological and biochemical laboratory measures from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sibutramine-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sibutramine 2005a</LINK> - see comparison tables). At end of treatment, there were significant differences between sibutramine and placebo groups in terms of lipids - LDL (n=37, WMD -33.80 CI -60.4 to -7.2) and a significant decrease in haemoglobin (n=37, WMD -0.70 CI -1.3 to -0.1) suggesting an improvement in glucose metabolism. <B>

<P>12. TREATMENT COMPARISON 3: H2 ANTAGONISTS versus PLACEBO<BR/>There were two trials included in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>) both reporting short term data by eight weeks assessment.</P>
<P>12.1 Weight<BR/>12.1.1 Total body weight (kg)<BR/>For final body weight, we found a significant difference favouring the treatment group at the end of eight weeks treatment (n=59, 2 RCTs, WMD -5.30 kg CI -8.4 to -2.20).</P>
<P>12.1.2 Change in weight<BR/>Due to heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 97.7%), results from the two trials were not summated for changes in weight. Heterogeneity may result from using different antipsychotics - olanzapine (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>) and quetiapine (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>). Both trials did demonstrate a significant reduction in weight for the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>, n=34, WMD -6.80 kg CI -7.9 to -5.7; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>, n=25, WMD -2.20 kg CI -3.0 to -1.5).</P>
<P>12.1.3 Total BMI <BR/>We found Body Mass Index favoured the H2 antagonists (n=59, 2 RCTs, WMD -1.51 CI -2.5 to -0.6) compared with placebo at eight weeks assessment.</P>
<P>12.1.4 Change in BMI<BR/>Due to heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 96%), results from the two trials were not summated for changes in BMI. Individually, each trail demonstrated a significant reduction in BMI in the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>: n=34, WMD -2.90 CI -3.5 to -2.3; <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>, n=25, WMD -1.10 CI -1.4 to -0.8). </P>
<P>12.2 Mental state - PANSS<BR/>There were no significant differences between groups on the PANSS scale at the end of treatment (n=59, 2 RCTs, WMD -2.03 CI -4.1 to 0.01).</P>
<P>12.3 Adverse effects<BR/>No adverse effects were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK>). We found reports of 'any adverse effects' were equivocal between H2 antagonists and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003b</LINK>, n=34, RR 1.33 CI 0.4 to 5.1). </P>
<P>12.4 Laboratory data<BR/>Both trials examined whether leptin levels were associated with reductions in weight. At the end of treatment, we found final leptin levels to favour the treatment group (n=59, 2 RCTs, WMD -3.83 ng/ml CI -5.5 to -2.2). Changes in serum leptin levels were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2004</LINK> and we found data favoured the H2 antagonist nizatidine (n=23, WMD -1.60 ng/ml CI -2.2 to -1.0) compared with placebo.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1 Applicability of results<BR/>The included studies involved people with schizophrenia from a wide range of settings including both inpatient and outpatients from the USA, Europe, Asia and Australia. Overall, both pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions showed modest efficacy in reducing weight gain confirming that weight loss is possible in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2003</LINK>). However, there were marked heterogeneity across the studies, which limits reliability in drawing substantive conclusions. </P>
<P>Interpretation is limited by a number of factors including: The small number of studies; for many pharmacological comparisons there was only a single study. There was variability in the nature and intensity (dosage) of the interventions. There was variability in study duration and follow-up. There was variability in study methodology. Most studies did not describe adequate randomisation and blinding procedures, and not all studies included an intention-to-treat analysis. While some studies reported metabolic endpoints apart from weight change (such as leptin, fasting glucose and fasting lipids), there was not enough consistency to allow for comparison between studies. Side effects and tolerability were not evaluated systematically by using structured scales. In addition, while clinical guidelines suggest that weight loss medications should only be used in combination with lifestyle counselling, the majority of pharmacological studies did not include, or did not describe, such a component. As with the general obesity literature, RCTs of pharmacological therapy rarely incorporate intensive exercise and behaviour therapy programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Poston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poston 2001</LINK>). Finally, there was an absence of long-term studies that would allow for evaluation of longer-term effectiveness and safety of the interventions. Given the rapid increase in publication of studies examining interventions for weight gain in this population since 2002, we expect that future studies will address these weaknesses and provide greater insight into what works best and for whom. </P>
<P>2. General <BR/>2.1 Pharmacological interventions<BR/>There was considerable variability in weight loss efficacy between pharmacological agents, as well as between studies of the same agent. At the present time, no single agent emerges as consistently superior in terms of weight loss efficacy. With the use of adjunctive pharmacological agents, there is always a concern regarding exacerbation of psychiatric symptomatology and adverse physical adverse effects. Generally, pharmacological agents were described as well tolerated. Clearly, the safety and tolerability of adjunctive pharmacological treatments need to be evaluated along with the effectiveness of these agents in moderating weight gain. Of the weight loss drugs currently in development, rimonabant, a selective cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist, submitted to the FDA for approval, may have special applicability in the psychiatric population and deserves future research attention (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2006</LINK>). Given that antipsychotic drugs most implicated in weight gain have in common antagonism at the H1 receptor, H1 agonists such as betahistine should be explored as potential pharmacological interventions for weight gain.</P>
<P>2.2 Non pharmacological Interventions<BR/>In terms of non pharmacological intervention, the five studies reported here suggest that such interventions are at least possible in this population with acceptable compliance although conclusions regarding the intensity of the intervention cannot be made at this stage. There is a need for further randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up to determine how best to package behavioural interventions, identify patient characteristics associated with adherence and successful outcome, and to examine how sustainable any outcomes are. Such interventions will probably need to set realistic goals, be highly structured, provide intensive support initially, and offer reduced but continued support over time, if not indefinitely. Adopting a stepwise approach of incremental weight management interventions implemented as early as possible and maintained throughout treatment, could be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Chue-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chue 2004</LINK>). Intervention components should probably focus on reducing caloric intake (changing types of food consumed and reducing portion sizes) rather than complex dietary change (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>), and support people in gradually increasing their levels of physical activity to 30 - 60 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2003</LINK>). Cognitive-behavioural strategies to facilitate these changes that are tailored to this population need to be developed and evaluated. Finally, further research will need to examine whether the costs of providing such intensive programs are less than the cost associated with not intervening at all (see <LINK REF="REF-Loh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loh 2006</LINK>). While not assessed within the included studies, we also suggest that future interventions should also include broader environmental manipulations to increase habitual levels of physical activity (for example, greater use of stairs instead of lifts or elevators; incorporating short bouts of physical activity during the day) and to decrease the amount of time spent sitting or engaged in sedentary behaviours such as television viewing, and to assist and reinforce small dietary changes (removal of 'junk food' vending machines; access to fruit and vegetables). Despite the low number of studies reported, the role of physical inactivity and poor diet as independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease infers the need for non pharmacological or lifestyle intervention regardless of weight loss per se.</P>
<P>Given the modest weight loss reported in both pharmacological and non pharmacological studies, the first strategy in preventing or alleviating weight gain remains identifying an appropriate choice of antipsychotic which has a lower liability of weight gain. Switching patients to an antipsychotic with a lower liability of weight gain might also be considered. However, a recent review suggests that available evidence does not yet support the clinical superiority of switching antipsychotics on various outcome measures such as weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Remington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remington 2005</LINK>). In addition, reviewing concomitant medications with additional weight gain liability (e.g. antidepressants and mood stabilizers) should also be considered.</P>
<P>3. PREVENTION COMPARISON 1: COGNITIVE/BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTION versus STANDARD CARE<BR/>3.1 Weight<BR/>Differences between groups for final total body weight were not significant, although when evaluated by measuring change scores, the cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI) group did achieve a significant improvement. Body Mass Index total scores were not significant, but again when assessed in terms of change from baseline the CBI group showed a significant advantage compared with standard care. Similarly, change scores derived from waistline measurements favoured the CBI group. More participants in the standard care group gained at least 7% of their initial weight than the CBI group. Overall, most available data, which was limited to small studies, did indicate that the intervention group gained less weight, but more robust studies of longer duration are needed to determine whether these differences are reliable and sustained.</P>
<P>3.2 Global state<BR/>Clinical Global Impression scores (quality of life, and overall improvement) were equivocal. Body image did favour CBI, although the data appear to be derived from another scale based around the CGI scale and no conclusion can be made.</P>
<P>3.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2003</LINK>) managed to retain all its participants. Whilst (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005b</LINK>) initially indicating better retention in the CBI group but this was not sustained during further follow up at six months after the study began.</P>
<P>4. PREVENTION COMPARISON 2: H2 ANTAGONISTS versus PLACEBO<BR/>4.1 Weight<BR/>All outcomes reported for weight gain, total scores, mean change in weight, body mass index or predefined cut off points (7%) did not reveal any significant differences between H2 antagonists and placebo. Only 14 participants were included in one (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>) study. Studies of this size are unlikely to detect small treatment effects, and much larger studies of longer duration are needed before we can determine whether these interventions are of value in the prevention of weight gain.</P>
<P>4.2 Global state<BR/>From limited data (n=14) we did not find any differences in Clinical Global Impression Scores from this short term study by <LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.3 Mental state<BR/>We found all mental state outcomes, positive and negative symptoms scores and BPRS total scores, were equivocal. </P>
<P>4.5 Adverse effects<BR/>From limited data, adjunctive H2 antagonist treatment did not appear to worsen or improve movement disorders in either short (<LINK REF="STD-Famotidine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Famotidine 2004</LINK>) or medium term (<LINK REF="STD-Nizatidine-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Nizatidine 2003a</LINK>) studies. </P>
<P>4.6. Leaving the study early<BR/>The adjunctive H2 antagonist treatment did not improve or reduce attrition relative to the control group in either short or medium term studies.</P>
<P>5. PREVENTION COMPARISON 3: H2 ANTAGONISTS - HIGHER DOSE versus H2 ANTAGONISTS - LOWER DOSE<BR/>5.1 All outcomes<BR/>All outcome measures (weight, mental state, adverse effects, leaving the study early) did not reveal any significant differences between high and lower dose H2 antagonists. </P>
<P>6. PREVENTION COMPARISON 4: 5HT REUPTAKE BLOCKER versus PLACEBO<BR/>6.1 Weight<BR/>We did not find any significant outcomes to suggest that 5HT reuptake blockers prevent or reduce weight gain. All data came from one study <LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2002</LINK>, and with just 30 participants detecting treatment effects was improbable.</P>
<P>6.2 Mental state<BR/>None of the outcomes measuring positive and negative symptoms domains and also depression were significant. Larger studies are needed to determine whether such effects exist.</P>
<P>6.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Only one outcome was reported for side effects categorised as 'any adverse effects' and we did not find 5HT reuptake blockers more likely to produce adverse effects compared with the control group.</P>
<P>6.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Adjunctive 5HT reuptake blockers did not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group in this short term study.</P>
<P>7. PREVENTION COMPARISON 5: SELECTIVE NOREPINEPHRINE REUPTAKE INHIBITOR versus PLACEBO <BR/>7.1 Weight <BR/>Outcomes measures were not consistent in the <LINK REF="STD-Reboxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reboxetine 2003</LINK> study. No differences were found in total body weight, but mean weight change did favour the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor group. Similarly, total body mass index data were equivocal, but mean change in body mass index favoured the treatment group. Weight gain predefined at 7% or more gain in initial body weight failed to show any differences between groups. With just 20 participants included this study is underpowered and more data are needed to determine whether a genuine treatment effect is present.</P>
<P>7.2 Global state<BR/>We did not find Clinical Global Impression scores were worse of better in the treatment group, based on limited data.</P>
<P>7.3 Mental state<BR/>Adjunctive treatment did not appear to affect positive (SAPS) and negative (SANS, HAM-D) symptoms domains compared with the control group, and was unlikely with both groups receiving antipsychotics (olanzapine).</P>
<P>7.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Adjunctive selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor did not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group in this short term (six week) study.</P>
<P>8. PREVENTION COMPARISON 6: ANTIDIABETIC AGENTS versus PLACEBO<BR/>8.1 Weight<BR/>All available data from just one (<LINK REF="STD-Metformin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Metformin 2006</LINK>) small study (n=37) indicated that antidiabetic agents did not prevent of reduce weight gain compared with the control group. Again, this study is underpowered and larger and longer studies are needed to determine whether a genuine treatment effect exists.</P>
<P>8.2 Mental state<BR/>Limited data did not indicate metformin affected mental state in terms of BPRS change scores.</P>
<P>8.3 Physiological<BR/>Adjunctive antidiabetic treatment did not worsen or improve glucose and lipids levels.</P>
<P>8.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Adjunctive antidiabetic treatment did not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group in this 14 weeks study.</P>
<P>9. PREVENTION COMPARISON 7: ANTICONVULSANT AGENT versus CONTROL<BR/>9.1 Weight<BR/>We found that participants given anticonvulsants had significantly smaller mean increase in weight (kg) compared with the control group. No other measures were available to assess changes in weight, and this results is based on 60 participants. More supporting data are needed to determine whether this is a genuine treatment effect.</P>
<P>9.2 Adverse effects<BR/>Only insomnia was reported as an adverse effect and anticonvulsants did not appear from limited data to worsen sleep compared with the control group.</P>
<P>9.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Adjunctive anticonvulsants (toprimate) did not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group in this 12 week study.</P>
<P>10. PREVENTION COMPARISON 8: SSRI's + LOW DOSE CLOZAPINE versus HIGH DOSE CLOZAPINE<BR/>10.1 Weight<BR/>No advantages were apparent for those participants given SSRI's in terms of total body weight and total body mass index values. When weight was assessed using the criteria of 7% or more gain in their initial weight the result did favour adjunctive SSRI's. Clinicians will need more consistent data to support this single positive result.</P>
<P>10.2 Global state<BR/>Adjunctive SSRIs do not appear to improve or worsen global state measures (GAF, CGI) compared with the control group.</P>
<P>10.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Many adverse effects outcomes were recorded but all data were equivocal. Two physiological measures (serum glucose and triglycerides) favoured adjunctive SSRIs, however this group were given low dose clozapine whilst the control were given higher doses of clozapine.</P>
<P>11. SYNTHESIZING PHARMACOLOGICAL COMPARISONS (PREVENTION)<BR/>11.1 Pharmacological<BR/>Although caution is required in summating trials examining different pharmacological interventions, there was a significant treatment effect demonstrating modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD - 1.16 CI -1.9 to -0.4). </P>
<P>12 TREATMENT COMPARISONS 1: COGNITIVE/BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTION versus STANDARD CARE<BR/>12.1 Weight <BR/>Overall, results indicated that participants given cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI) lost more weight than the standard care group. This was consistent for most measures such as total weight score, mean weight change, body mass index, or &gt;10% weight reduction. The three included studies were small and most outcomes would have been equivocal had the data been analysed without being pooled. Larger studies are needed to add weight to these initial favourable finding.</P>
<P>12.2 Satisfaction<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cog_x002f_Behav-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Cog/Behav 2005a</LINK>) assessed satisfaction with care and overall more participants were satisfied in the CBI group than those receiving standard care.</P>
<P>12.3 Global state<BR/>No differences were found in terms of Clinical Global Impression scores.</P>
<P>12.4 Mental state<BR/>Mental state was not affected by adjunctive CBI compared with participants receiving only antipsychotics.</P>
<P>12.5 Laboratory measure<BR/>The addition of CBI did not affect blood pressure or lipids levels.</P>
<P>12.6 Leaving the study early<BR/>The additional intervention of CBI does not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group during medium term.</P>
<P>13. TREATMENT COMPARISON 2: ANTI OBESITY AGENTS +/- LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT versus PLACEBO +/- LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT <BR/>13.1 Weight<BR/>Weight loss outcomes were inconsistent. Anti obesity agents did significantly reduce weight in terms of total body weight, as did change scores but the two pooled studies were heterogeneous. Also total body mass index favoured anti obesity agents but BMI change scores did not support this finding. The two studies providing data were underpowered and much larger studies are needed to determine whether such treatments are effective for weight loss.</P>
<P>13.2 Global state<BR/>Anti obesity agents did not worsen or improve global state (GAF).</P>
<P>13.3 Mental state<BR/>Outcome measures (PANSS, SANS) did not indicate that anti obesity agents improved or worsened mental state.</P>
<P>13.4 Adverse effects<BR/>Many adverse effects were recorded but the addition of anti obesity agents did not increase the frequency of such side effects compared with the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower in the control group, but this is based on a sample of just 37. Most physiological measures were equivocal and impossible to draw firm conclusion from the few data which favoured the control group.</P>
<P>13.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>The additional intervention of anti obesity agents did not improve or reduce attrition rates relative to the control group during medium term evaluation.</P>
<P>14. TREATMENT COMPARISON 3: H2 ANTAGONISTS versus PLACEBO<BR/>14.1 Weight<BR/>Outcomes were inconsistent and the advantages of the H2 antagonist (nizatidine) are unclear. Final body weight did significantly favour H2 antagonists, as did mean change in weight, but this latter data contained substantial heterogeneity. Similarly, total body mass index favoured H2 antagonists but when reported as change scores these outcomes were heterogeneous. The available data are inconclusive and more robust data are needed before firm conclusion can be drawn.</P>
<P>14.2 Mental state<BR/>The addition of nizatidine did not improve or worsen mental state (PANSS) scores.</P>
<P>14.3 Adverse effects<BR/>Participants receiving the H2 antagonists did not experience any more adverse effects than the standard care group, although data were only available from one of the two studies in this comparison. Leptins were, however, lower in the treatment group.</P>
<P>14.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>The data did not suggest that the addition of nizatidine worsened or improved attrition in the treatment group compared with the control group.</P>
<P>15 TREATMENT COMPARISON 4: APPETITE SUPPRESSANT versus PLACEBO<BR/>15.1 Weight <BR/>Data did not reveal a consistent pattern. Total body weight at end of study was significantly lower in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Phenylpropanol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phenylpropanol 2002</LINK>). Short term change scores, however, were equivocal but medium term data did favour appetite suppressants. The results were based on small data sets (n=16 to 20) and no conclusion can be drawn as to the effects of appetite suppressants on weight loss.</P>
<P>15.2 Mental state<BR/>Limited data (PANSS) were unremarkable and no significant differences were found.</P>
<P>15.3 Adverse effects<BR/>All data were equivocal and no significant differences were apparent from limited data.</P>
<P>15.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Appetite suppressants did not appear to worsen or improve study compliance.</P>
<P>16. TREATMENT COMPARISON 5: 5HT REUPTAKE BLOCKER versus PLACEBO <BR/>16.1 Weight<BR/>The limited data (n=30) from just one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fluoxetine-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fluoxetine 2003</LINK>) did not indicate any benefit gained in weight loss whilst using adjunctive 5HT reuptake blockers compared with the control group. This study is however underpowered and larger and longer trials are needed before any firm conclusion can be drawn.</P>
<P>16.2 Mental state<BR/>Positive and negative symptom (PANSS +ve, PANSS -ve, and HAM-D) domain scores were not improved or worsened with the addition of fluoxetine.</P>
<P>16.3 Extrapyramidal symptoms<BR/>Movement disorders were equivocal whether measured with the SAS, BAS scales or AIMS checklist.</P>
<P>16.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>The addition of fluoxetine did not improve or worsen attrition rates relative to the control group.</P>
<P>17. TREATMENT COMPARISON 6: ANTIPARKINSONIAN DRUGS versus PLACEBO<BR/>17.1 Weight<BR/>Most outcomes were not significantly different and not clear conclusion can be made from three small underpowered studies.</P>
<P>17.2 Mental state<BR/>All outcomes were equivocal (BPRS, MADRS) from limited data.</P>
<P>17.3 Adverse effects<BR/>All outcomes, except insomnia, were not significantly different between the antiparkinsonian group and control and no trend emerged to suggest amantadine increased the likelihood of experiencing such side effects.</P>
<P>17. 4 Leaving the study early<BR/>The antiparkinsonian drug (amantadine) did not appear to worsen or improve study attrition.</P>
<P>18. TREATMENT COMPARISON 7: ANTICONVULSANTS versus PLACEBO<BR/>18.1 Weight change<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Topiramate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Topiramate 2005</LINK>) reported on weight with just 20 participants included. Participants given the anticonvulsant topiramate lost weight but no more than the placebo group. Larger and longer trials are needed before we can determine whether anticonvulsants are an effective intervention for the control of weight in people with schizophrenia.</P>
<P>18.2 Adverse effects<BR/>All data (n=20) were equivocal.</P>
<P>18.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>The addition of topiramate did not improve or worsen study attrition during medium term evaluation.</P>
<P>19. TREATMENT COMPARISON 7: ANTICONVULSANTS HIGHER DOSE versus PLACEBO LOWER DOSE<BR/>19.1 Weight <BR/>Higher dosage topiramate did have a greater reduction in weight than the lower dose group, but this is based on only 33 participants and no firm conclusions can be made from such limited data.</P>
<P>19.2 Adverse effects<BR/>Higher dose topiramate did not worsen or improve side effects compared with the lower dose group.</P>
<P>19.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Neither high nor low doses of adjunctive anticonvulsants affected attrition rates.</P>
<P>20. SYNTHESIZING PHARMACOLOGICAL COMPARISONS (TREATMENT)<BR/>20.1 Weight<BR/>There was an overall treatment effect (mean weight change) for the pharmacological interventions (n=273, 9 RCTs, WMD -3.85 CI -4.3 to -3.4) but there is also substantial, and understandable, heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=89%).</P>
<P>20.1.1 Pharmacological Interventions<BR/>There was considerable variability in weight loss efficacy between pharmacological agents, as well as between studies of the same agent. Of drugs currently on the market, reboxetine, and topiramate were effective at weight prevention and topiramate (at 200mg) was effective for established weight gain, although there was only a single study for each. There were mixed results with sibutramine, nizatidine and amantadine and negative results for fluoxetine (treatment and prevention study), and famotadine and phenylpropinolamine. At the present time, no single agent emerges as consistently superior in terms of weight loss efficacy. With the use of adjunctive pharmacological agents, there is always a concern regarding exacerbation of psychiatric symptomatology and adverse physical side-effects. Generally, pharmacological agents were described as well tolerated. Clearly, the safety and tolerability of adjunctive pharmacological treatments need to be evaluated along with the effectiveness of these agents in moderating weight gain. Of the weight loss drugs currently in development, rimonabant, a selective cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist, submitted to the FDA for approval, may have special applicability in the psychiatric population and deserves future research attention (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2006</LINK>). Given that antipsychotic drugs most implicated in weight gain have in common antagonism at the H1 receptor, H1 agonists such as betahistine should be explored as potential pharmacological interventions for weight gain.</P>
<P>20.1.2 Non pharmacological interventions<BR/>In terms of non pharmacological intervention, the five studies reported here suggest that such interventions are at least possible in this population with acceptable compliance although conclusions regarding the intensity of the intervention cannot be made at this stage. There is a need for further randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up to determine how best to package behavioural interventions, identify patient characteristics associated with adherence and successful outcome, and to examine how sustainable any outcomes are.

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia. Modest short-term weight loss can be achieved with some pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions (that promote physical activity and changes in diet). However, clear guidance regarding what works best is limited by the small number of studies and the variability of the interventions themselves as well as their intensity and duration. People with schizophrenia should ask their clinician for support and advice regarding weight management, appraise the evidence in this review, and come to some mutually acceptable approach to prevention or treatment. It may be that the best path is for people with schizophrenia to work with researchers and clinicians to help build better evidence than is seen in half a decade of trials. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>There is currently limited information in terms of randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of interventions to moderate weight gain. Existing data suggest that short term modest weight loss is possible with non-pharmacological and selective pharmacological interventions. There is, however, insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia. The first strategy in preventing or alleviating weight gain or metabolic disturbance is to appraise metabolic risk when prescribing antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications, although priority should be given to achieving good control of the mental illness (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gough 2004</LINK>). Patients, family, and caregivers should be educated about metabolic risks and receive lifestyle advice regarding diet and physical activity. Baseline screening and a monitoring plan must be initiated on commencement of antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2006</LINK>). During monitoring, if diabetes develops in close temporal relation to the new antipsychotic prescription, serious consideration must be given to discontinuing or switching medication. With significant weight gain or emerging metabolic effects (for example, impaired fasting glucose or dyslipidemia), the risk and benefit of antipsychotic choice and concomitant medications should be re-evaluated from both a psychiatric and a metabolic perspective, and at this stage, patients should be referred to a more structured and supervised lifestyle intervention where available. Adjunctive pharmacotherapy for weight loss should be reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to lifestyle interventions alone.</P>
<P>3. For managers and policy makers<BR/>Managers and policy makers should be aware that the weight gain commonly seen in people with schizophrenia is a serious clinical problem that is related to premature morbidity and mortality, and reduced quality of life. The long-term impact of addressing the high prevalence of obesity in this population will provide a significant economic burden. However, current strategies for preventing or treating weight gain in people with schizophrenia only produce modest reductions in weight and these changes have only been found in the short-term. There is merit to incorporating lifestyle interventions within the skill set of the case management system, as opposed to referring people to a primary care physician or other health care provider for management of cardiovascular disease risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkner 2006</LINK>). People with serious mental illness have frequent contact with their mental health service providers. Changing health behaviours can be difficult, and frequent reinforcement may play a critical role in successful long-term adoption of regular physical activity and diet modification. Additionally, there are mental health-specific barriers to physical activity and dietary change that can be more appropriately addressed by people trained to be sensitive and supportive in regard to these issues (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2005</LINK>). At this stage, there is no evidence that such strategies will be cost-effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General <BR/>All future studies should respect standards of measuring outcomes and of reporting data in order to enhance the comparability of study results (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). In the included studies data reporting was inconsistent. </P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>Further randomised controlled trials with larger samples and longer treatment duration are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of both pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions in preventing weight gain and effecting weight loss in schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotic medications. To assist interpretation, trialists should report baseline and final outcomes including means difference (including standard deviations). Binary outcomes (number of patients losing &gt; 7% initial body weight) should also be reported as they are easier to interpret and clinically relevant. Pharmacological studies should include behavioural lifestyle interventions (diet and physical activity) in all study arms. Side effects and tolerability should be evaluated more systematically using structured rating scales. Participants and interventions should be described in detail and results should include intention-to-treat analysis and document characteristics of participants lost to follow-up and ideally their outcome. Generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment should be clearly described. As reported elsewhere, most studies to date have not used adequate methods or failed to describe how they concealed the allocation (separating the process of randomisation from the recruitment of patients)(<LINK REF="REF-Hewitt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitt 2005</LINK>). This may influence the degree of effect found. While double-blind evaluation of the outcome of cognitive/behavioural interventions may be impossible, researchers should take every effort to minimise biases by using blind or independent raters. Finally, access to such interventions may be less likely in standard clinical practice. Including economic analyses regarding the delivery of these interventions will be necessary to enable clinicians and purchasers to manage service provision and make best use of resources.</P>
<P>Studies predominantly used weight or body mass index (BMI) as the outcome measure. Other measures such as waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference should be included. For example, BMI does not recognise fat distribution and the accumulation of fat in and around the abdominal region associated with obesity. In particular, abdominal visceral adipose tissue increases with age in both sexes. Therefore, measures of waist circumference should also be included, as it is a simple measurement that indicates accumulation of abdominal fat. Such a measure may also be the best single indicator of cardiovascular risk factors and a simpler measure for identifying the need for weight management. Studies should carefully monitor and report adherence to physical activity programs and dietary intake. Further research is required examining interventions during the initial period of antipsychotic treatment when weight gain appears to be most rapid. Finally, distinguishing between weight gain prevention and weight gain reversal needs closer attention. We suggest an outline for a trial in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<TD>
<P>Allocation: the randomisation process should be clearly described.<BR/>Double-blind evaluation of the outcomes of a lifestyle intervention is extremely difficult, and probably impossible. Trialists should, take every precaution to minimise the effect of biases by using blind or independent raters.<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis is preferable. Trialists should describe from which groups withdrawals came, why they occurred and what was their outcome.<BR/>Duration: One year follow-up at minimum.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Diagnosis: people with schizophrenia or related disorders.<BR/>Age: all ages .<BR/>Sex: men &amp; women. <BR/>N=300.*<BR/>Ethnicity: should be reported.<BR/>History: people in their first episode reported separately. Distinction between weight gain prevention and treatment should be clear.</P>
</TD>
