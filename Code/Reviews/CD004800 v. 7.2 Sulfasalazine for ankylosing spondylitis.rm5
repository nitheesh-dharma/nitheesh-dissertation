<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-18 11:47:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a review of the effect of sulfasalazine for people with ankylosing spondylitis. After searching for all relevant studies up to November 2013, we found 11 studies involving 895 people. Our findings are summarised below.</P>
<P>
<B>The review showed that in people with ankylosing spondylitis:</B>
</P>
<P>- compared with fake pills, sulfasalazine probably has little or no difference in pain, disease activity, physical function, spinal mobility, patient and physician global assessment;</P>
<P>- damage to the spine as seen on x-ray or magnetic resonance image was not measured and therefore it is not known whether sulfasalazine slows damage;</P>
<P>- people had side effects such as stomach upsets, skin reactions/rashes and mouth sores;</P>
<P>- more people stopped taking sulfasalazine because of the side effects than when taking fake pills; and</P>
<P>- there is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis, and more research is needed.</P>
<P>
<B>What is ankylosing spondylitis and what is sulfasalazine?</B>
</P>
<P>Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis, usually in the joints and ligaments of the spine. It may also affect the shoulders, hips, or other joints. Pain and stiffness occur and limit movement in the back and in other joints that are affected.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results of this review</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took sulfasalazine rated their pain to be 3 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 after 3 to 36 months than those who took placebo (3% absolute improvement).</P>
<P>- People who took sulfasalazine rated their pain to be 47 on a scale of 0 to 100 after 3 to 36 months.</P>
<P>- People who took placebo rated their pain to be 50 on a scale of 0 to 100 after 3 to 36 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI)</B>
</P>
<P>This outcome was not measured in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Bath ankylosing spondylitis function index (BASFI)</B>
</P>
<P>This outcome was not measured in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI)</B>
</P>
<P>This outcome was not measured in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Radiographic progress</B>
</P>
<P>This outcome was not measured in the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Total number of withdrawals due to adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>- 23 more people taking sulfasalazine withdrew due to adverse events than those taking placebo.</P>
<P>- 13 out of 100 people taking sulfasalazine withdrew due to adverse events.</P>
<P>- 9 out of 100 people taking fake pills withdrew due to adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Serious adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>Only one person out of 469 stopped taking sulfasalazine for serious adverse events.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-02 21:45:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and affects mainly the spine, but can also affect other joints. Disease progression may result in loss of mobility and function. Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used in the treatment of AS. However, its efficacy remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-02 21:22:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-02 01:45:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for relevant randomized and quasi-randomized trials in any language, using the following sources: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (2003 to 28 November 2013); EMBASE (2003 to 27 November 2013); CINAHL (2003 to 28 November 2013); Ovid MEDLINE data, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (28 November 2013); and the reference sections of retrieved articles.</P>

<P>We evaluated randomized and quasi-randomized trials examining the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine on AS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-10 10:50:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently reviewed unblinded trial reports according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of the studies were resolved, when necessary, by recourse to a third review author. The same authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and entered the data extracted from the included trials. We combined results using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data.</P>
<P>We restructured outcome measures for this update based on recommendations from the editorial group. Major outcomes included: pain, Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis function index (BASFI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI), radiographic progression, total number of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-10 10:50:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not add any new studies to this review following the updated search. In the original review, we included 11 studies in the analysis, involving 895 participants in total. All included studies compared sulfasalazine with placebo. We judged most of the studies as low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias in five domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting, and other sources of bias). However, for incomplete outcome data, we only judged one trial at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>None of the included trials assessed BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI or radiographic progression. Different parameters were used to assess pain. The pooled MD for back pain measured on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale was -2.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.33 to 0.41; absolute risk difference 3%, 95% CI 1% to 6%; 6 trials). Compared to placebo, a significantly higher rate of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15; absolute risk difference 4%, 95% CI 0.4% to 8.8%; 11 trials) was found in the sulfasalazine group. A serious adverse reaction was reported in one patient taking sulfasalazine (Peto odds ratio 7.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 378.16).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-02 06:16:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to support any benefit of sulfasalazine in reducing pain, disease activity, radiographic progression, or improving physical function and spinal mobility in the treatment of AS. A statistically significant benefit in reducing the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and easing spinal stiffness was mentioned in the previous version. However, the effect size was very small and not clinically meaningful. More withdrawals because of side effects occurred with sulfasalazine. Further studies, with larger sample sizes, longer duration, and using validated outcome measures are needed to verify the uncertainty of sulfasalazine in AS.</P>

<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-02 05:20:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and belongs to a group of diseases known as spondyloarthropathies, which includes reactive arthritis, arthritis/spondylitis in inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis/spondylitis and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. The disease has a relatively early onset, presenting at a mean age of 26 years, and occurs somewhat more frequently in men than in women (<LINK REF="REF-Feldtkeller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldtkeller 2003</LINK>). Depending on the geographical region, the prevalence of AS is about 0.1% to 1.4% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Akkoc-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akkoc 2005</LINK>). Disease progression may result in loss of mobility and function, and therefore patients can experience a heavy disease burden, with pain and stiffness, loss of physical function, and severe impairment in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zink-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zink 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-02 22:02:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physiotherapy and exercises are the main non-pharmacological therapies, with modest evidence showing a beneficial effect for AS (<LINK REF="REF-Dagfinrud-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagfinrud 2008</LINK>). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the corner stone of pharmacological treatment. In 2010, the Assessment of Ankylosing Spondylitis/European League Against Rheumatism suggested that NSAIDs, including Coxibs, were recommended as first-line drug treatment for AS patients with pain and stiffness. Continuous treatment with NSAIDs is preferred for patients with persistently active, symptomatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 2011a</LINK>). For patients refractory or intolerant to NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>) and sulfasalazine have been used as a second-line approach. Sulfasalazine has been used in rheumatoid arthritis for decades and a clinically and statistically significant benefit in rheumatoid arthritis disease activity has been confirmed in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Suarez_x002d_Almazor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suarez-Almazor 1998</LINK>). It is the best studied disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used in AS, but its efficacy remains unclear. Although AS is difficult to treat, the treatment options for AS have been broadened since the discovery of TNF-alpha inhibitors, e.g. adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab. TNF-alpha inhibitors have been extensively studied in AS (<LINK REF="REF-Zochling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zochling 2005</LINK>). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gorman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bosch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bosch 2002</LINK>) showed that they were highly effective in improving disease activity, spinal mobility, function, and pain. However, their expense means that few patients can access them.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-02 06:01:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sulfasalazine has been described as an anti-inflammatory drug or immunomodulator (<LINK REF="REF-Smedeg_x00e5_rd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smedegård 1995</LINK>). We hypothesized that sulfasalazine had a similar effect on AS. However, the accurate mechanisms of sulfasalazine in AS were unclear.</P>

<P>For erythrocyte sedimentation rate, four trials found statistically significant differences between intervention groups, favoring sulfasalazine over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krajnc-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krajnc 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nissila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nissila 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>). A similar result was found in the pooled data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.40" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.40</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.41" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.41</LINK>). MD of change from baseline was -3.11 mm/hr, 95% CI -4.62 to -1.60 mm/hr. MD of end point was -7.07 mm/hr, 95% CI -14.39 to 0.25 (not statistically significant). Significant heterogeneity existed among the trials (P = 0.02). This could be due to the large difference of erythrocyte sedimentation rate at baseline levels among the studies. Three trials, <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nissila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nissila 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>, assessed C-reactive protein and only one, <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>, showed a statistically significant difference between intervention groups, favoring sulfasalazine over placebo.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We did not perform a sensitivity analysis against concealment because we did not rank any included trials at high risk of bias. Blinding was reported in all studies, however, three participants broke the blinding during the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 1990</LINK>. Continuous outcome data were unavailable in this trial. For the dichotomous outcome, withdrawals due to side effect, exclusion of this trial from the analysis showed a similar result (<LINK REF="CMP-001.44" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.44</LINK>). Since continuous data included only the participants who completed the trials, we excluded the trials with more than 30% drop-outs (<LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>), to see if a high percentage of drop-outs affected the results. After exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK> (no continuous data was available in <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1993</LINK>), we found that the MD of chest expansion and MD of duration of morning stiffness (change from baseline) became statistically insignificant, which have been mentioned above. Other outcomes remained similar. Only the median and CI values were available in <LINK REF="STD-Dougados-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dougados 1986</LINK>. We assumed that mean was equal to median for each outcome and calculated the SD from the CI and sample size. Therefore, the mean and SD were estimated in this trial. Sensitivity analysis, however, found no obvious difference between inclusion and exclusion of this trial in the pooled result. The <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Feltelius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Feltelius 1986</LINK> trials had the least number of participants and the shortest periods. When excluded, the pooled difference of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (end point) became statistically significant (weighted MD -6.13 mm/hr, 95% CI -11.89 to -0.37 mm/hr), while other results remained similar.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup data</HEADING>
<P>We could not group studies of sulfasalazine versus placebo according to characteristics of interventions and participants. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1989</LINK>) presented data of subgroups (participants with and without peripheral arthritis). In participants with peripheral arthritis (N = 15), we did not find a statistically significant difference between intervention groups in back pain, score of sleep disturbance, chest expansion, Schober's test, fingers-to-floor test, articular index, degree of joint swelling, patient assessment of disease severity, duration of morning stiffness, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. For participants without peripheral arthritis (N = 34), we did not find a statistically significant difference in these outcomes (but articular index and degree of joint swelling were not assessed) except back pain measured with a 100 mm visual analogue scale (where 0 = no pain, 100 = severe), which was shown to significantly favor sulfasalazine over placebo (MD -9.20, 95% CI -17.81 to -0.59) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Another study separately analyzed the results of participants with peripheral arthritis (N = 77) and found more peripheral responses in the sulfasalazine than placebo group (55.9% versus 30.2%, P = 0.023) (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>). Here, peripheral response was a composition of four parameters, e.g. patient self assessment, physician assessment, joint pain/tenderness score, and joint swelling score. Peripheral response was defined as improvement in at least two parameters, with no worsening in other parameters. We did not analyze these parameters in Review Manager 5 because the information on treatment allocation was not given (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-14 10:01:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Shaopeng Lin">
<P>We identified 11 RCTs evaluating the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). These trials enrolled 895 participants in total. All these trials compared sulfasalazine with placebo. More than 30 outcomes were assessed. Most of the pooled data in the present review included only a few trials (less than five) and few participants (less than 400). Seven major outcomes, e.g. pain, bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), bath ankylosing spondylitis function index (BASFI), bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI), radiographic progression, total number of withdrawals, and total number of withdrawals due to adverse events, were included in the present review. None of the included studies assessed BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI or radiographic progression. Different parameters were used to assess pain. We chose the most used one, e.g. back pain, to be included in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. We did not find any statistically significant difference in either individual trial data or pooled analysis results, except that back pain measured with visual analogue scale (0 mm to 100 mm) was found to be statistically significantly lower in the sulfasalazine group compared with the placebo group in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nissila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nissila 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>). However, the pooled mean difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>With regard to the safety of sulfasalazine, the total number of adverse events was higher in the sulfasalazine group than in the placebo group; a serious adverse reaction occurred in one patient taking sulfasalazine. Statistically significantly higher rates of withdrawals due to side effects, and for any reason were found in the sulfasalazine group compared to the placebo group. The most frequent side effects with sulfasalazine were nausea, heartburn, epigastric distress, skin reactions, lightheadedness, and headache.</P>
<P>In addition, the pooled data showed that sulfasalazine did significantly ease morning stiffness and reduce erythrocyte sedimentation rate, even though the slight difference does not have much clinical significance. For other outcomes, it was not possible to pool the data.</P>
<P>Among the included trials, only two (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1989</LINK>), analyzed the effect of sulfasalazine on peripheral arthritis. One trial presented data of the subgroup with peripheral arthritis (N = 15) and found no statistically significant difference between the sulfasalazine and placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1989</LINK>). The other study separately analyzed the results of participants with peripheral arthritis (N = 77) and found more peripheral responses in the sulfasalazine group than in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>). There is not enough evidence suggesting sulfasalazine is better for peripheral joints than for the spine.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-03 16:36:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies did not report most of the major, validated outcomes such as BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI or radiographic progression. In addition, the study population in the included trials involved 895 AS participants who fulfilled New York criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 2002</LINK>) which required radiographic change. The majority of these participants were adults, and considered to have active disease, although the definition of active disease differed among the trials. The duration of disease ranged from 3.8 to 21.9 years. Therefore, the evidence was not applicable to juvenile patients and those patients with early disease onset.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-02 21:51:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review shows limited benefit of sulfasalazine in AS. The strength of evidence in this review should be ranked as moderate level for several reasons. First, the potential benefit of sulfasalazine might be overlooked because most of the pooled data in the present review included only a few trials (less than five) and few participants (less than 400). Moreover, obvious methodological drawbacks existed as specified in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section. Finally, the included participants were all patients at an advanced stage of AS who might not respond well to sulfasalazine.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ferraz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferraz 1990</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of five RCTs and concluded that sulfasalazine significantly relieved pain and morning stiffness, compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougados-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dougados 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feltelius-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Feltelius 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nissila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nissila 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1989</LINK>). Six RCTs have been published since then (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corkill-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Corkill 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krajnc-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krajnc 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1991</LINK>). Our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>), and the current update showed limited benefit of sulfasalazine in reducing erythrocyte sedimentation rate and easing spinal stiffness, as the effect size was small and not clinically significant. We did not find any other published systematic review, meta-analysis or RCT comparing sulfasalazine with placebo in our updated search. For peripheral arthritis of AS, the present review did not support any benefit of sulfasalazine, in accordance with the experts' recommendation of using TNF-alpha inhibitors (such as etanercept), rather than sulfasalazine, if available (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijde-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijde 2011</LINK>). A randomized double-blind study comparing etanercept with sulfasalazine found that etanercept was more effective in all joint assessments, regardless of swollen joint involvement (<LINK REF="STD-Braun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Braun 2011</LINK>). Therefore, etanercept might be a better choice for management of patients with AS and peripheral joint involvement.</P>
