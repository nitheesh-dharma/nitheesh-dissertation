<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-08 14:05:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many countries have an increasing rate of caesarean section. Higher rates do not always give additional health gains and they can increase maternal risks and affect subsequent pregnancies. Active management of labour has been proposed to reduce the number of caesarean births. Active management includes routine amniotomy (artificial rupture of the membranes), strict rules for diagnosing slow progress, use of the intravenous drug oxytocin to increase contractions of the uterus and one-to-one care. The disadvantages of active management are that it can possibly lead to more invasive monitoring, more interventions and a more medicalised birth in which women have less control and less satisfaction. The review included seven trials involving 5390 women. These studies show that women who received active management were slightly less likely to have a caesarean section and were more likely to have shorter labours (less than 12 hours). There was no difference in the number of assisted deliveries, nor was there any difference in complications for mothers or their babies when comparing women in the active management group with those receiving routine care.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-08 14:05:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 15% of women have caesarean sections (CS) and while the rate varies, the number is increasing in many countries. This is of concern because higher CS rates do not confer additional health gain but may adversely affect maternal health and have implications for future pregnancies. Active management of labour has been proposed as a means of reducing CS rates. This refers to a package of care including strict diagnosis of labour, routine amniotomy, oxytocin for slow progress and one-to-one support in labour.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-08 14:05:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials, with a total of 5390 women. The quality of studies was mixed. The CS rate was slightly lower in the active management group compared with the group that received routine care, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01). However, in one study there was a large number of post-randomisation exclusions. On excluding this study, CS rates in the active management group were statistically significantly lower than in the routine care group (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94). More women in the active management group had labours lasting less than 12 hours, but there was wide variation in length of labour within and between trials. There were no differences between groups in use of analgesia, rates of assisted vaginal deliveries or maternal or neonatal complications. Only one trial examined maternal satisfaction; the majority of women (over 75%) in both groups were very satisfied with care.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 15:45:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Active management is associated with small reductions in the CS rate, but it is highly prescriptive and interventional. It is possible that some components of the active management package are more effective than others. Further work is required to determine the acceptability of active management to women in labour.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-08 10:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The global caesarean section (CS) rate is estimated as 15%, with CS rates over 20% in many developed countries, Latin America and the Caribbean (<LINK REF="REF-Betran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betran 2007</LINK>). CS rates in many countries continue to increase. In the USA, the CS rate is estimated to have increased by 3% from 2005 to 2006 reaching a record high of 31.1% (<LINK REF="REF-NVSR-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NVSR 2007</LINK>). The rate in England increased from 21.5% in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>) to 23.8% in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Bragg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bragg 2010</LINK>). In Brazil, about one in two births are by CS (CS rate 51%) (<LINK REF="REF-Najmi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Najmi 2000</LINK>) and across Latin American countries overall, CS rates are 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2007</LINK>). While the optimum rate of CS remains controversial, countries with increasing CS rates have focused on strategies to reduce its use due to concern that higher CS rates do not confer additional health gain, but may increase maternal risks, have negative implications for future fertility and subsequent pregnancies, and have resource implications for health services (<LINK REF="REF-Betran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betran 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In England and Wales, 20% of CSs were carried out for poor progress in labour or 'failure to progress' (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). In 1970, the use of a labour ward protocol for low-risk women called 'active management of labour' was described with the aim of reducing the length of labour and the numbers of women who have CS (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active management of labour as originally described by O'Driscoll (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1973</LINK>) includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>one-to-one support in labour (continual presence of a nurse during labour);</LI>
<LI>routine amniotomy (artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes);</LI>
<LI>the use of the intravenous drug oxytocin;</LI>
<LI>strict criteria for the diagnosis of labour;</LI>
<LI>strict monitoring of progress in labour (e.g. by plotting on a partogram);</LI>
<LI>strict criteria for identifying slow progress and fetal compromise;</LI>
<LI>peer review of assisted deliveries.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Active management is a complex package of interventions. In the original description of active management the aim was to ensure that women experienced a shorter labour. This included strict criteria for the diagnosis of labour based on the woman's assessment and confirmed by a senior member of staff using objective evidence (i.e. 'show', spontaneous rupture of membranes, complete effacement of the cervix). Once diagnosed, both amniotomy and oxytocin were used to improve or augment the progress of labour by increasing the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions. During the first stage of labour acceptable rate of progress was set at 1 cm cervical dilatation per hour and during the second stage progress was measured in terms of descent and subsequent rotation of the head. A maximum of 10 hours was allowed for the first stage of labour and two hours for the second stage. Observational studies by the initiators of active management showed lower CS rates, less prolonged labour, better neonatal outcomes and maternal satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1984</LINK>). However, subsequent observational studies did not have similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Peaceman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peaceman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 1994</LINK>) and, hence, it has remained an area of controversy. The disadvantage of active management is related to the need for more interventions during labour, possibly with invasive monitoring resulting in a more medicalised birth process in which women have less control and less satisfaction.</P>
<P>Recent meta-analyses have included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of single interventions (oxytocin administration only or amniotomy only) on reducing the CS rate. Neither of these single interventions was effective for reducing CS rates (<LINK REF="REF-Bidgood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bidgood 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bugg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bugg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2013</LINK>). The use of partogram alone is currently being considered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of one-to-one support in labour (without other interventions) demonstrated its effect in reducing CS rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>). Therefore, it is possible that the effectiveness of the active management of labour package could be due to this component alone. Alternatively, it is possible that the effect on CS rates from a policy of active management occurs as a result of the combination of interventions rather than because of individual interventions.</P>

<P>We included seven studies comparing groups of women receiving a package of care for the active management of labour. These studies were carried out in hospital settings in several countries, three in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Zeno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Zeno 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1997</LINK>) and one each in New Zealand (<LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>), Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1996</LINK>), Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Somprasit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Somprasit 2005</LINK>), and Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Tabowei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tabowei 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although we intended to include studies recruiting both nulliparous and multiparous women, all the included studies stated nulliparity as an inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The included studies all had a pre-defined package of care during labour and childbirth (intervention arm), which was compared with less interventionist or routine care. The intervention packages included all or several of the elements associated with active management. All of the packages included routine amniotomy soon after labour diagnosis (usually within one hour) irrespective of any delay being diagnosed, strict monitoring of progress and augmentation with oxytocin if progress was deemed slow or delayed (more than 1 cm cervical dilatation in the first stage of labour or delayed descent in the second). Oxytocin was typically administered at high doses in the intervention groups (e.g. 6 mU/min increasing by 6 mU every 15 minutes to a maximum of 36 or 40 mU per minute unless uterine hyperstimulation or fetal distress were identified). Most of the packages included frequent vaginal examinations to identify slow progress (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Special antenatal childbirth education was a feature of the active management package in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tabowei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tabowei 2003</LINK>). One-to-one care was part of active care where resources permitted (<LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Zeno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Zeno 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tabowei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tabowei 2003</LINK>), otherwise one-to-two care was offered (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somprasit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Somprasit 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The comparison groups had more variable care. Routine care depended on the care setting, local labour ward management protocols, and the variable practice of clinicians. Routine amniotomy was generally not performed unless delay was identified. The criteria for identifying delay was less stringent and, with the exception of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1996</LINK>, when delay was identified, oxytocin was administered at lower doses than in the actively managed groups (e.g. 1 mU per minute increasing every 30 minutes unless contraindicated).</P>
<P>When interpreting the results of this review it is important to bear in mind the considerable variability in care offered to women in both the intervention and comparison groups across the studies. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the variation in management protocols for women in the two study groups in the different studies. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows the rate of interventions in women in the active management groups compared to those receiving routine care in the included studies.</P>
<P>Similar facilities were available to both intervention and comparison group members in terms of access to pain relief and electronic fetal monitoring. The availability of epidural analgesia and more sophisticated monitoring devices depended on the resources available in the study setting rather than on study group allocation.</P>

<P>The levels of loss to follow-up and exclusions were low in all but two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK> randomised women in the third trimester. Between randomisation and the onset of labour more than a third of the original sample became ineligible. The reasons for post randomisation exclusions were justified by the study authors, and appeared balanced between intervention and comparison groups. However, the exclusion of women who became ineligible after randomisation is a serious design flaw, and this level of exclusion is likely to introduce bias. For this study, it was only possible to include post-randomisation exclusions in an intention-to-treat analysis for the main review outcome - CS <I>see</I> <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> comparison <I>1.1 CS rates- all women</I> ).</P>
<P>In the New Zealand study described by <LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>, there was a large number of exclusions between recruitment to the study and onset of labour with 46% of those recruited in the third trimester no longer eligible by the time they went into labour. Those excluded before labour were reported as being different in a number of respects from those remaining eligible (e.g. eligible women who remained in the study tended to be younger and less likely to be of European origin). In this study however, the exclusions were done before randomisation which took place at the onset of labour and data were available for most of those women randomised. Therefore, there is low risk of bias from this study for outcomes measured in labour. However, results from this study included data from maternal questionnaires collected six weeks post-partum and for outcomes measured at this time (including maternal satisfaction and breast feeding) there was considerable attrition. Overall response rates were 72% (28% attrition). Further, there were differences in the response rates for the active management (76% responded) and the control group (68% responded). The high level of attrition overall, and the different response rates in the two arms of the trial, are likely to introduce bias for outcomes measured in the postnatal period.</P>

<P>All seven included studies (5390 participants) reported on CS as an outcome.

Due to the high number of post randomisation exclusions, analysis was repeated excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK> study to examine the effect of this study (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

In this study, the majority of women had positive views about their care. A high proportion of women in the routine care group (75%) reported that they were very satisfied with their care overall. Women in both the active management group and those in the routine care group had reported similar levels of satisfaction (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Similarly, high levels of satisfaction were reported for other measures of satisfaction, and none of the differences between groups reached statistical significance. Most women (at least two thirds) in both groups reported that they would choose the same style of care again, had a strong sense of achievement, had adequate pain relief and thought that the staff caring for them explained what was happening.</P>

<P>Women in the active management (intervention) group tended to have shorter labours than those receiving routine care. However, there was considerable variation reported in the duration of labour both within and between studies. In view of the heterogeneity between trials, we used random-effects meta-analyses for all of these outcomes. Further, in three studies it was not clear whether women who had CS were excluded from analyses relating to length of labour (<LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Zeno-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Zeno 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tabowei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tabowei 2003</LINK>). Thus, the results relating to the length of labour should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Six studies (3242 participants) reported on prolonged labour (labour lasting more than 12 hours) as an outcome.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-08 14:08:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, in these studies active management was associated with a small reduction in CS rates and a shorter length of labour (&lt; 12 hours) but had little impact on most other outcomes. Compared with routine care, active management of labour did not have an effect in either direction on morbidity for mothers or babies.There was no difference in maternal satisfaction between the two groups but only one trial evaluated this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>). This trial was set in Australia, and it is unclear if these findings are generalisable to other settings. Furthermore, there was high loss to follow-up rate in this study which could introduce bias into the results.</P>
<P>Interpretation of the results from included studies is not simple; first, there was variation between studies in what was included within an active management package; second, there was considerable variation in the care received by women in the comparison groups within and between studies; and third, for some outcomes e.g. duration of labour, there was considerable heterogeneity in study findings.</P>
<P>The primary outcome in this review was delivery by CS. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK> had a serious design flaw that resulted in a large number of women who were already randomised to receive either active management or routine care becoming ineligible for the study at a later date. Although data were provided such that the analysis for CS could be carried out for all randomised women, such a large rate of exclusions meant that a large number of women in the active management group would not have received the intervention, which therefore introduces a bias towards the null in the results. Consequently, we repeated the analysis excluding this study to investigate its effect on the results. Having excluded this study, the CS rate in the active management group was statistically significantly lower compared to the usual care group (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94). In this analysis, the overall CS rate in the control group was 12% which is the same rate as that recorded for women in England and Wales who had a CS after going into labour (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active management is associated with modest reductions in the CS rate. With interventions to combat rising CS rates being highlighted as a priority in many countries, even modest reductions may have a public health impact. The recent NICE guidance on intrapartum care does not recommend the routine use of active management of labour for practice within the UK context (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). However, their analysis included only four (<LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tabowei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tabowei 2003</LINK>) of the seven trials that we included. Furthermore, the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Frigoletto 1995</LINK> trial, may not be appropriate as the high rate of post randomisation exclusions within the trial introduces bias into the results towards the null, as we have demonstrated in the results of this review. Some individual components of active management are effective in reducing the CS rate, such as continuous support for women in labour (RR 0.91 95%CI 0.83-0.99) (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>). Our review aimed to investigate the effect on CS rates from a policy of active management and our findings suggest that active management is associated with modest reductions in the CS rate (RR 0.77 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94). However, further research is required to investigate women's satisfaction with the use of active management of labour.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-08 11:02:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base so far suggests that the use of a policy of a package of interventions (active management of labour) is likely to result in modest reductions in the CS rate. The benefits of small reductions in the CS rate should be balanced against the risk of increasing interventions in the management of low-risk pregnancies and further evaluation would be needed to investigate this. Further work is also required to determine the acceptability of, and women's satisfaction with, such policies.</P>

<P>While studies collected information on adverse events most did not have the power to detect differences between groups. There is little information on maternal satisfaction in different settings and future studies should evaluate this.</P>
