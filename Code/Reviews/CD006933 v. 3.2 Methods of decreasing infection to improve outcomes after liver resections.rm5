<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-19 18:35:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Liver resections involve removing a part of the liver mainly for cancer or pre-cancerous growths. Liver resections are major operations associated with about 3.5% risk of death and about 10% to 15% risk of major post-operative complications (defined as complications resulting in a prolongation of hospital stay). Various methods have been advocated to decrease the infectious complications after liver resection. We do not know if they are of any benefit to the patient or the health-care funder. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (available until August 2011) to determine the benefits and harms of different interventions in decreasing the infectious complications and improving the outcomes after liver resection. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. Such trials, when conducted properly, provide the best evidence.</P>
<P>We included seven trials involving 521 patients for this review. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 12 to 180. The comparisons performed included whether antibiotics are necessary routinely during the peri-operative period of liver resection, the duration of antibiotics, and the use of other agents to improve the general body resistance to infection. There was no difference in the risk of death or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. All the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (ie, there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance). We are unable to advocate or refute any method of decreasing infectious complications after liver resection. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.</P>

<P>Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects model using RevMan Analysis.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We included seven trials including 521 patients for this review. The sample size in the trials varied from 12 to 180 patients. All the trials were of high risks of systematic errors and of random errors. Four trials included patients who underwent liver resection only. In the remaining three trials, patients underwent combined liver resection with extrahepatic biliary resection resulting in a biliary enteric anastomosis. Four trials included only major liver resection. The remaining three trials included a mixture of major and minor liver resections. It appears that the proportion of cirrhotic patients in the trials was very low. The comparisons performed included whether antibiotics are necessary routinely during the peri-operative period of liver resection, the duration of antibiotics, the use of prebiotics and probiotics in the perioperative period, use of recombinant bactericidal-permeability increasing protein 21 (rBPI21), and the use of topical povidone iodine gel at the time of wound closure. Only one or two trials were included under each comparison. There was no significant differences in mortality or severe morbidity in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Elective liver resection is performed mainly for benign and malignant liver tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghiti 1993</LINK>). The malignant tumours include primary liver cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma) but also metastases from malignancies of other organs (<LINK REF="REF-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1996</LINK>). Although every liver resection is considered major surgery, only resection of three or more segments is labelled as a major liver resection (<LINK REF="REF-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belghiti 1993</LINK>). More than 1800 elective liver resections are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone (<LINK REF="REF-HES-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2010</LINK>). The overall mortality associated with liver resection is about 3.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 2007</LINK>). The major morbidity rate after liver resections resulting in prolongation of hospital stay is about 10% to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 2007</LINK>). Approximately 12 to 23% of patients undergoing liver resection develop infectious complications including chest infections, infected abdominal collections, or wound infections (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Farid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farid 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall 30-day mortality after liver resection is about 3.5% with sepsis accounting for approximately a quarter of this, ie, approximately 1% of patients undergoing liver resection die within 30 days because of infectious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Farid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farid 2010</LINK>). The presence of infectious complications also decreased the long-term survival in patients (<LINK REF="REF-Farid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farid 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Various methods have been advocated to decrease the infectious complications such as pneumonias, infected intra-abdominal collections, or wound infections after liver resection. These included systemic interventions such as antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1998</LINK>), prebiotics, probiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Kanazawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kanazawa 2005</LINK>), and topical interventions such as povidone iodine (<LINK REF="STD-Hiramatsu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hiramatsu 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Antibiotics and topical interventions kill the bacteria. Prebiotics and probiotics alter the bacterial flora, thereby improving the general health of the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2008</LINK>). This may result in improvement in the immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2008</LINK>). By decreasing the infective complications and the necessity for reoperations or other procedures such as abdominal drain insertion, these interventions may decrease the overall morbidity, decrease the costs associated with the management of these complications, and improve the patient quality of life.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-06 18:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">

<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also planned to report the risk difference if it was different from the risk ratio since risk difference includes trials with zero-events in both groups for the meta-analysis. For continuous variables, we planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for hospital stay; and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for variables such as quality of life. For time-to-event outcomes such as long time survival, we planned to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. For count-data outcomes such as serious adverse events, we calculated the rate ratio with 95% CI.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>This systematic review has shown no significant difference in mortality or in the rate of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons included in this review. None of the trials reported quality of life. Thus, there is currently no evidence to support any intervention with regards to major patient benefit.</P>
<P>We chose the outcomes based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not choose infectious complications as a separate outcome. The reason for this is to harmonise the outcomes across the different reviews related to liver resection. This will enable comparison of different unrelated interventions which are aimed at improving patients outcomes after liver resection, say, methods of decreasing infection and methods of decreasing blood loss during liver resection. In a state-funded healthcare system with limited available resources, it is important for healthcare provider and healthcare funder to enable comparison of unrelated interventions both in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness. By choosing an outcome, 'serious adverse events', this becomes possible to perform such a comparison while this comparison will be more difficult if we had chosen 'infectious complication' as the outcome. </P>
<P>Although the intervention resulted in significantly shorter hospital stay in two out of five comparisons (pre-operative and post-operative prebiotics and probiotics versus post-operative prebiotics or probiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2006</LINK>); the recombinant bactericidal-permeability increasing protein versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>), the findings are not reliable because of the high risk of bias in the trials (nearly 20% of patients were excluded from the analysis post-randomisation in one trial - <LINK REF="STD-Sugawara-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sugawara 2006</LINK> because patients did not undergo liver resection) and because we could not assess the consistency. So, the intervention cannot be advocated over the placebo with regards to hospital stay. None of the trials reported the number of unplanned visits to the doctor and return to work, which may have financial implications to the patient and/or health-care funder. In the only trial that reported the costs, these were significantly lower in the no antibiotic group than in the antibiotic group (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1998</LINK>). Again, considering the risk of bias in the trial and the lack of confirmation in more trials, we are unable to advocate or refute antibiotic use in patients undergoing liver resection.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-18 06:14:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>This review is applicable to patients undergoing elective liver resection. Liver resection with excision of extra-hepatic biliary tree involves a biliary-enteric anastomosis (connection between biliary tract and small bowel exposing the patient to gut flora from the cut end of the bowel). Patients undergoing liver resection with excision of extra-hepatic biliary tree can be considered to be at a higher risk of infection than patients undergoing liver resection without excision of extra-hepatic biliary tree. The evidence from trials in which extra-hepatic biliary tree was excised is applicable to only such patients. Evidence from trials in which liver resection was performed without a biliary enteric anastomosis is similarly applicable to only those patients undergoing liver resection without excision of extra-hepatic biliary tree.</P>
<P>Although some of the trials included major liver resections only, the evidence may be extrapolated to patients undergoing minor liver resections also. The cirrhotic status of the patients was not stated in four of the seven trials. However, most of the trials included patients with biliary tract cancer and colorectal liver metastases. The proportion of patients with cirrhosis is likely to be low (given that these patients were undergoing major liver resection often involving more than four segments). Thus, this evidence is applicable to non-cirrhotic patients only.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-05 19:16:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>All the trials were of high risk of bias. We were unable to assess the consistency of results since there was only one trial that could be included under each comparison. There was no indirectness of evidence as the performed trials compared interventions in patients generally seen in clinical practice. Five of the seven trials were performed in Japan or Taiwan. However, considering that the proportion of cirrhotic patients was low in the trials, the results are applicable in the western population also.The outcomes used in this review were also clinical outcomes rather than any surrogate outcomes. The next issue is whether the effect estimates in the trials included in this review were precise. The overall mortality associated with liver resection is about 3.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 2007</LINK>). Since this is not a very common event, we assessed whether the confidence intervals of the risk difference included the minimal clinically important difference on either side of the line of no effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>). We considered that 1% mortality is clinically important. All the trials included in this review included -0.01 and + 0.01 in their confidence intervals indicating that the effect estimates obtained were not precise. Thus, overall, the quality of evidence is poor.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-03-09 21:26:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We were unable to assess the reporting bias in this review because of the inclusion of only one trial under each outcome. So, we are unable to judge whether there could be other unreported trials in this topic.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-18 06:22:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>There have been no systematic reviews on this topic. We do not agree with Wu et al who advocated at the end of his trial that antibiotics should not be used routinely in patients undergoing liver resection (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1998</LINK>). The authors of the other trials did not recommend any intervention firmly.</P>
