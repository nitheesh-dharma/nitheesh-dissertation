<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-31 02:34:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Central venous access (CVA) involves a large bore catheter inserted in a vein in the neck, upper chest or groin (femoral) area to give drugs that cannot be given by mouth or via a conventional needle (cannula or tube in the arm). CVA is widely used. However, its thrombotic (causing a blood clot) and infectious complications can be life-threatening and involve high-cost therapy. Research has revealed that the risk of catheter-related complications varies according to the sites of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion. It would be helpful to find the preferred site of insertion to minimize the risk of catheter-related complications. This review examined whether there was any evidence to show that CVA through any one site (neck, upper chest, or femoral area) is better than the other. Four studies were identified comparing data from 1513 participants. For the purpose of this review, three comparisons were evaluated: 1) internal jugular versus subclavian CVA routes; 2) femoral versus subclavian CVA routes; and 3) femoral versus internal jugular CVA routes. We compared short-term and long-term catheter insertion. We defined long-term as for more than one month and short-term as for less than one month, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No randomized controlled trial was found comparing all three CVA routes and reporting the complications of venous stenosis. </P>
<P>Subclavian and internal jugular CVA routes had similar risks for catheter-related complications in long-term catheter insertion in cancer patients. Subclavian CVA was preferable to femoral CVA in short-term catheter insertion because of lower risks of catheter colonization and thrombotic complications. In catheter insertion for short-term haemodialysis, femoral and internal jugular CVA routes had similar risks for catheter-related complications except internal jugular CVA routes were associated with higher risks of mechanical complications. Further trials comparing subclavian, femoral and jugular CVA routes are needed.</P>

Subclavian CVA routes were preferable to femoral CVA routes in short-term catheterization because femoral CVA routes were associated with higher risks of catheter colonization (14.18% or 19/134 versus 2.21% or 3/136) (n = 270, one RCT, RR 6.43, 95% CI 1.95 to 21.21) and thrombotic complications (21.55% or 25/116 versus 1.87% or 2/107) (n = 223, one RCT, RR 11.53, 95% CI 2.80 to 47.52) than with subclavian CVA routes. Regarding femoral versus internal jugular routes, the evidence was moderate and applicable for short-term haemodialysis catheterization in critically ill patients. No significant differences were found between femoral and internal jugular CVA routes in catheter colonization, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and thrombotic complications, but fewer mechanical complications occurred in femoral CVA routes (4.86% or 18/370 versus 9.56% or 35/366) (n = 736, one RCT, RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.88).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-31 03:01:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-31 02:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Central venous access (CVA), in which a large bore catheter or venous access device (VAD) is placed in a vein in the neck, groin or upper chest, is needed to give drugs that cannot be given by mouth or via a conventional cannulae in the arm. Drugs administered via these catheters include antibiotics, chemotherapy, intravenous feeding, drugs such as those acting on the heart and blood vessels, blood products and other agents. CVA may also be required in intensive care settings to assess venous and cardiac function or it is used for haemodialysis in patients requiring renal replacement therapy.</P>
<P>Concerns have arisen over the number of catheters where the vein that the catheter is in becomes blocked by a blood clot (thrombosis) or by narrowing of the vessel (stenosis) around the catheter. One third of all thromboses of the upper extremity are related to intravenous catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Yellin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yellin 1996</LINK>). The clinical picture of central venous thrombosis is recognized by the development of pain and swelling of the neck and arm and a positive venogram, which is performed by administering a radio-opaque dye into the affected vein, or a positive doppler ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Alhimyary-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhimyary 1996</LINK>). The prognosis for patients with catheter-related venous thrombosis is good in uncomplicated cases (<LINK REF="REF-Hye-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hye 1996</LINK>). However, certain clinical groups, for example patients with malignant disease, appear to be at a greater risk of developing venous thrombosis. Most central venous catheter (CVC) related thrombosis is asymptomatic. A systematic review reported that in cancer patients, 29% (range 5% to 62% ) of patients had asymptomatic CVC-related thrombosis and 12% (range 5% to 54%) had symptomatic thrombosis. These CVC-related thromboses can cause postphlebitic syndrome in 15% to 30% of cases and pulmonary embolism in 11% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Kuter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuter 2004</LINK>). Severe cases of venous thrombosis, involving virtually total occlusion of the superior vena cava, can be life-threatening, increase hospital stay and require lifelong anticoagulant therapy, which incurs considerable healthcare costs and inconvenience to patients.</P>
<P>Catheter-related infection is also a major health and economic issue. In the United States, approximately 16,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) occur in intensive care units (ICUs) each year, and 500 to 4000 patients die annually of CRBSI (<LINK REF="REF-Mermel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermel 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, these infections lead to an increase in hospital stay and costs. In a cohort study, it was reported that among the patients who developed an episode of CRBSI, the hospital stay was increased by 19.6 days. This represented an added cost of EUR 3124 per episode of CRBSI (<LINK REF="REF-Rello-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rello 2000</LINK>). Another controlled clinical study showed that CRBSI was associated with an increase of USD 56,167 (in 1998 USD) in total hospital costs, an increase of USD 71,443 in ICU costs, a 22-day increase in hospital length of stay, and a 20-day increase in ICU length of stay (<LINK REF="REF-Dimick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dimick 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-31 02:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To gain CVA, a silicone or polyurethane tube is passed into the venous system, often via the subclavian vein in the shoulder or the internal jugular vein in the neck and less commonly via the femoral vein in the groin. The distal tip of the CVC is ideally positioned in the lower third of the superior vena cava, or the inferior vena cava if a femoral approach is used.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-31 03:01:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of studies revealed that the risk of catheter-related complications varied according to the site of CVC insertion. However, the conclusions were controversial. Some studies supported the theory that a higher incidence of catheter-related infections and thrombosis was associated with femoral access than with other central venous sites and concluded that the subclavian was the preferred site of insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Goetz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Goetz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorente-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trottier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Trottier 1995</LINK>); some reported no increased risk of catheter-related complications for the different insertion sites (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deshpande-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Deshpande 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mer 2009</LINK>); some have even reported a higher risk of complications related to subclavian catheterization (<LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schillinger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schillinger 1991</LINK>). These discrepancies in study results may be partly caused by different  types of patients and CVC characteristics, diagnostic modalities (venography, ultrasound), the criteria used and, importantly, most of the trials were prospective cohort studies. This meant that one could not rule out selection bias by a preference given to one approach over the others as a result of habits or the experience of the operator and may result in overestimation of the benefits of the more commonly used approach (<LINK REF="REF-Timsit-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timsit 2003</LINK>). One guideline published in 2007 concluded that no randomized controlled trials had satisfactorily compared infection or thrombosis rates for catheters placed via the jugular, subclavian and femoral sites (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 2007</LINK>). The recommendations about the preferred site for catheterization were not supported by strong evidence from randomized studies. Hence, a need for well-designed clinical trials was identified.</P>
<P>There are already two systematic review of this literature. A meta-analysis, published up to the year 2000, reported that there were significantly more arterial punctures with jugular access compared with subclavian access, but fewer malpositions with jugular access. There was no evidence of any difference in the incidence of haemato- or pneumothorax and vessel occlusion in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK>). Another meta-analysis, published up to the year 2007, reported that rates of catheter-related infection and arterial puncture were higher with jugular access as compared to subclavian access (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK>). Both systematic reviews included non-randomized studies and concluded that selection bias could not be ruled out. Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK> only compared internal jugular with subclavian catheterization; there were no data on femoral versus subclavian or femoral versus internal jugular catheterization.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>). The aim of that review was to assess the evidence from available randomized studies on whether the incidence of venous thrombosis, venous stenosis or infection related to CVA devices varied with the site of catheterization. In this update we have not limited the comparison to internal jugular versus subclavian catheterization but compared the catheter-related complications among all three CVA routes.</P>

The quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate because of an unclear risk of attrition bias in the included study (the number of participants with catheter colonization was inconsistent with the number reported in subgroup analysis for the effect of BMI).</P>
<P>No significant differences were found in the complications of catheter colonization, CRBSI and thrombosis between the femoral and internal jugular routes. An a priori subgroup analysis for the effect of BMI on catheter colonization demonstrated that in patients with the highest BMI tercile (&gt; 28.4), the femoral routes should not be favoured over internal jugular routes.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>There were four randomized studies included in this updated review. No randomized controlled trial was found comparing all three central venous sites and reporting the complications of venous stenosis. Regarding internal jugular versus subclavian insertion sites, only data on long-term catheterization were available. There is a need for studies of short-term catheterization comparing internal jugular with subclavian CVA routes. Regarding femoral versus subclavian routes, and femoral versus internal jugular routes, there were no available data on long-term catheterization.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Regarding internal jugular versus subclavian routes, the evidence was applicable for long-term catheterization in cancer patients. There were no significant differences in catheter-related complications between the two insertion sites (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). Since cancer patients appear to be at a greater risk of developing venous thrombosis, the evidence from this group may not be applicable to other types of patients.</P>
<P>Regarding femoral versus subclavian routes, the evidence was from data on short-term catheterization. Subclavian routes were associated with less catheter colonization and fewer thrombotic complications compared with femoral routes. Risks for mechanical complications were similar between the two sites (<LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>). The explanation for these conclusions may be that the subclavian site was easier to sterilize during the insertion procedure and there was less movement of the catheter after placement at this site (<LINK REF="REF-Collignon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collignon 1988</LINK>). Femoral routes showed a higher incidence of infectious colonization and thrombotic complications, probably because of the higher bacterial density of local skin flora in the groin area (<LINK REF="STD-Lorente-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding femoral versus internal jugular routes, the evidence was also from the data on short-term catheterization. No significant differences were found between femoral and internal jugular CVA routes in catheter-related complications except more total mechanical complications occurred in internal jugular CVA routes. However, the evidence was from the data on catheters for haemodialysis where the participants often received routine anticoagulation, which might have contributed to lower rates of thrombosis. These conclusions might differ if studies are performed with catheters used for administrating drugs. Furthermore, guidelines have recommended the use of ultrasound guidance to reduce complications and improve success in central venous catheterization, especially for an internal jugular line (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). There were few patients who received internal jugular catheterization with ultrasound guidance in the included study, which further limits the applicability of the conclusion. In regards to mechanical complications, the conclusion may not be fully applicable to hospitals where ultrasound is routinely used.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-01-31 11:12:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, most included studies were not of very high reporting quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>). Though all included studies described adequate sequence generation, two studies did not describe allocation concealment and blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>), one had an unclear risk of incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2008</LINK>), one only reported completed trial patients and had a high risk of selective reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). There was only one study with high reporting quality; this study described randomization, allocation concealment and blinding in detail (<LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>). The overall quality of evidence was moderate.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there appeared to be a considerable risk of bias in the included studies and we have to say that there was still a lack of systematic and strong evidence on optimal insertion sites for clinical practice.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-01-31 11:15:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been reported that obtaining and including data from unpublished trials is one obvious way of avoiding publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In this review, all included studies were published reports and we could not find any unpublished data. Thus, publication bias may exist. In some included studies the outcomes were not precisely defined and we contacted the study investigators to collect missing information. However, contacting authors of trial reports may lead to overly positive answers (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, there are other possible sources of bias (for example the operator experience, the sterile technique and catheter care) that may significantly influence the outcomes when comparing the preferred site of catheterization.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-31 11:31:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regarding internal jugular versus subclavian CVA routes, we found one prospective, non-randomized observational study which also included a comparison of long-term catheterization in cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK>). Araujo et al reported no significant difference in the rates of local infection (0.4% versus 1.5%, P = 0.110 ) or totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) related sepsis (1.8% versus 2%, P = 0.775) between internal jugular and subclavian sites. These results were similar to the infectious complications of our included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). The results on thrombosis and mechanical complications remain controversial. Araujo et al reported that thrombosis occurred in 2.0% of participants with subclavian sites and 0.6% for internal jugular sites (P = 0.044). In our included study (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>), thrombosis occurred in 6.5% for subclavian sites and 12.8% for internal jugular sites, higher than the data from <LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK> probably because the definitions used for thrombosis were different. The definition of thrombosis in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK> was thrombosis in symptomatic cases while <LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK> included thrombosis with and without clinical symptoms. In <LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK>, the immediate and late mechanical complications occurred in 5.0% and 10.5%, respectively, for subclavian sites and in 1.6% and 4.9% for internal jugular sites (P<I> </I>&lt; 0.001), which were higher than the data of <LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>. These discrepancies may be partly caused by the use of ultrasound guided access to the subclavian sites in <LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-Araujo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Araujo 2008</LINK> did not use ultrasound guidance, and bias due to a higher number of emergency catheterizations in observational studies.</P>
<P>Regarding femoral versus subclavian routes, in the included study for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>) the rates of catheter colonization and CRBSI were similar to those available in the literature (<LINK REF="STD-Goetz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Goetz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gowardman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gowardman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorente-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 2005</LINK>). The rate of femoral thrombosis (21%) was similar to the 25% rate reported in <LINK REF="STD-Trottier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Trottier 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>Regarding femoral versus internal jugular routes, in the included study for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2008</LINK>) the incidence of colonization (25.43%) was higher than the 2.53% reported in <LINK REF="REF-Harb-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harb 2005</LINK> and 6.2% reported in <LINK REF="REF-Souweine-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souweine 2006</LINK>. Parienti et al explained that this was because of the different BMIs of participants and different durations of insertion with dialysis catheters. The rate of mechanical complications in internal jugular sites (9.56%) was similar to the 6.3% to 11.8% reported in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-McGee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGee 2003</LINK>). The rate of mechanical complications in the femoral group (4.86%) was lower than the 12.8 to 19.4% reported in <LINK REF="REF-McGee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGee 2003</LINK>, which is probably because of the experienced operators in <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2008</LINK> and the randomization process, which avoided the selection of a route according to the operator's preference (<LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were able to identify two systematic reviews which compared complications of central venous access sites in addition to the earlier version of this Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>). One was in English (<LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK>) and the other was in Chinese (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK> reported that there were significantly more arterial punctures with jugular access compared with subclavian access, but fewer malpositions with jugular access. There was no evidence of any difference in the incidence of haemato- or pneumothorax and vessel occlusion in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK> reported that the rate of catheter-related infection and arterial puncture were higher with the internal jugular routes than the subclavian routes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK> collected data from non-randomized studies and only compared subclavian with internal jugular catheterization; both concluded that selection bias could not be ruled out. To our knowledge, the earlier version of this Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>) was the first to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether the incidence of venous thrombosis, venous stenosis or infection related to CVA devices varied with the site of catheterization. It identified only one randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>) that employed one comparison, femoral versus subclavian catheterization, and concluded that subclavian CVA was preferable to femoral CVA. This update includes three new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biffi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Biffi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parienti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Parienti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>) and performed an a priori subgroup analysis according to the duration of catheterization. There were three comparisons in our review: subclavian versus internal jugular catheterization; femoral versus subclavian catheterization; femoral versus internal jugular catheterization. Regarding the comparison of subclavian versus internal jugular catheterization, we concluded that there were no significant differences in catheter-related complications. This was different from the results of <LINK REF="REF-Reusch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reusch 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK>,  probably because we only included randomized controlled trials and we included different  types of patients and different durations of catheterization.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Overall, no randomized controlled trial was found comparing all three central venous sites and reporting the complications of venous stenosis. Regarding internal jugular versus subclavian insertion sites, there is a need for studies of short-term catheterization comparing these two sites. Regarding femoral versus subclavian insertion sites and femoral versus internal jugular insertion sites, there is a need for studies of long-term catheterization and studies with ultrasound guidance catheterization. Further research is required to address these issues.</LI>

<LI>We updated the review into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.1</LINK> resulting in slight reformatting in the Methods section.</LI>
<LI>We included risk of bias and summary of findings tables.</LI>
<LI>We added the outcome 'Leaving the studies early' and included the search results from four Chinese databases.</LI>
<LI>We revised the criteria for included studies as follows.</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>In the earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>), the criteria for including participants were patients requiring long-term intravenous therapy (the definition for 'long-term' was intended to be in situ for at least one month). This review included only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Merrer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merrer 2001</LINK>). However, the duration of the catheterization in this study was under two weeks. We performed an a priori subgroup analysis according to the duration of catheterization, long-term (&gt; 1month) and short-term (&lt; 1 month) in this new updated version.</LI>
<LI>The earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>) reported that they included randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, but the results showed that the real selection criterion was only randomized controlled trials, not controlled clinical trials. In this updated version we included only randomized controlled trials to avoid selection bias.</LI>
<LI>The earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2007</LINK>) stated the objective "To determine whether the circumference of a long-term central venous access device influences the incidence of venous thrombosis, venous stenosis or infection related to CVA devices", but there was no description or search terms about the circumference of a central venous access device in the background part and in the search strategies. We deleted this objective in the updated version.</LI>
