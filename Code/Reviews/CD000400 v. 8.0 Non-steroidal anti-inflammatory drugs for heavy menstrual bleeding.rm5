<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) but tranexamic acid, danazol or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) work better.</P>
<P>Women seek help for HMB when it impacts on their quality of life although the menstrual loss can be assessed objectively. Levels of prostaglandin (naturally occurring fatty acids) are higher in women with HMB and are reduced by NSAIDs. The review of trials found that NSAIDs are modestly effective in reducing HMB but danazol, tranexamic acid and LNG IUS are more effective. Danazol caused a shorter duration of bleeding and more adverse effects than NSAIDs but this did not stop women using it. These results were based on a small number of underpowered trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-21 06:48:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in premenopausal women. Although surgery is often used as a treatment, a range of medical therapies are also available. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce prostaglandin levels, which are elevated in women with excessive menstrual bleeding and also may have a beneficial effect on dysmenorrhoea.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-21 06:48:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of NSAIDs in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years with HMB.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-30 14:43:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders &amp; Subfertility Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in July 2012 and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-21 06:48:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs or combined with other medical therapy with either each other, placebo or other medical treatments in women with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic (treatment-induced) causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-11 11:28:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review and data were extracted independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data of nine trials. The results of the remaining seven cross-over trials with data unsuitable for pooling, one trial with skewed data and one trial with missing variances were described in data tables.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:15:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>As a group, NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at reducing HMB but less effective than either tranexamic acid, danazol or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS). Treatment with danazol caused a shorter duration of menstruation and more adverse events than NSAIDs but this did not appear to affect the acceptability of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between NSAIDs and the other treatments (oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, an older progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (Progestasert), oral contraceptive pill (OCC)) but most studies were underpowered. There was no evidence of a difference between the individual NSAIDs (naproxen and mefenamic acid) in reducing HMB.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-22 07:58:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>NSAIDs reduce HMB when compared with placebo but are less effective than tranexamic acid, danazol or LNG IUS. However, adverse events are more severe with danazol therapy. In the limited number of small studies suitable for evaluation, no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated between NSAIDs and other medical treatments such as oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, OCC or another type of intrauterine system, Progestasert.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-11 11:33:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-11 11:33:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia or HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women and a very common gynaecological problem. It causes a major burden in quality of life for women (<LINK REF="REF-Frick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frick 2009</LINK>) and uses substantial healthcare resources (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). HMB accounts for 5% to 25% of primary care consultations or outpatient referrals to specialist units but rates vary substantially between countries (<LINK REF="REF-Kadir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadir 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osei-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osei 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Protheroe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Protheroe 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>HMB has often been objectively defined as 80 mL or more of menstrual blood loss (MBL) per period (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>), which is unrelated to pregnancy or any known pelvic or systemic disease. However, this definition is mainly used in research and is difficult to quantify in the clinical setting. Unacceptably problematic bleeding is most commonly determined by the patient herself if the amount or frequency of blood loss interferes with her physical or psychosocial wellbeing. This personal perception is often what determines the need for treatment, and the assessment of outcomes afterwards. To clarify the situation, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) formally defined HMB as "the woman's perspective of increased menstrual volume, regardless of regularity, frequency, or duration" (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research studies have traditionally used the alkaline haematin method to measure HMB objectively (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>), but a simpler method that is often used is the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>). With this method, the woman assesses the blood loss on her used sanitary pads or tampons and assigns a numerical score. More recently, it has been suggested that total menstrual fluid loss (TMFL) may be used as an assessment of HMB (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>). Measurement is determined by the difference in weight of tampons or pads before and after use. TMFL has been found to correlate well with changes in objective MBL and may be of more relevance to women concerned mainly about heavy menstrual flow (flooding).</P>
<P>Surgery has traditionally had a dominant role in treating HMB, but 80% of women treated by surgery have no anatomical pathology and over a third of women undergoing hysterectomy for excessive blood loss have normal uteri (wombs) removed (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gath-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gath 1982</LINK>). Thus, medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery and a bonus of preserved fertility in women who have not completed their family, is an attractive alternative.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:04:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A wide variety of medications are used to reduce HMB. The currently available medical therapies include hormonal agents, anti-fibrinolytic drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These agents vary in their effectiveness, tolerability and acceptability to women. When selecting a medical treatment, patient preference and need for contraception are issues that need to be taken into account, together with the benefits and risks of each treatment. NSAIDs are considered useful for women not desiring contraception, especially women with dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2008</LINK>). Individual NSAIDs used for the treatment of HMB include mefenamic acid (MFA), naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-29 16:52:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A rationale for the use of NSAIDs is given by the accumulation of data suggesting a role for the prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Hagenfeldt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagenfeldt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1991</LINK>). The endometrium of women with excessive menstrual bleeding has been found to have higher levels of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2&#945; when compared with women with normal menses (<LINK REF="REF-Willman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willman 1976</LINK>). There is further evidence of deranged haemostasis (abnormal clotting) as the ratio of prostaglandin E2 to F2&#945; (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1981</LINK>) and the ratio of prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) to thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="STD-Makarainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Makarainen 1986</LINK>) are elevated. These substances are present both in the endometrium and myometrium, although the exact mechanism by which the excessive blood loss occurs remains speculative. NSAIDs reduce prostaglandin levels by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>NSAIDs are contraindicated in women with HMB and an underlying bleeding disorder because of their inhibitory effect on platelet (cell fragment) aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Kadir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadir 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-22 07:44:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs have been found to reduce MBL by 25% to 35% or more in about three-quarters of women with HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2004</LINK>). NSAIDs also can have a beneficial effect on dysmenorrhoea, a symptom often related to HMB. Side effects of treatment, especially gastrointestinal effects, are variable in frequency but are not usually severe. It is important to distinguish this medical option for HMB from other options with respect to effectiveness, tolerability, acceptability and safety for women to make informed choices. In addition, it is usually assumed that there are no differences in effectiveness between individual NSAIDs, even though there are individual women who seem to respond well to one agent but less well to another. This assumption has been tested in this review with the inclusion of individual NSAID comparisons for the treatment of HMB.</P>

<P>Data extraction was performed independently by all three review authors using forms designed according to The Cochrane Collaboration's guidelines. One of these review authors was a content expert and the others had methodological expertise. Where necessary, additional information on trial methodology or actual trial data were sought from the principal author of any trials that appeared to meet the eligibility criteria. In cases where results were presented in graphs and no actual data were given, the data were extracted from the graphs.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-12 12:20:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (AL and either CA or SF) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Individual domains included sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data; each domain was separately scored as either low, unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This assessment is presented in 'Risk of bias' tables in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and summary figures (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:13:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous data (for example, proportion of patients who found the treatment unacceptable), results for each study were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto odds (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). For all dichotomous outcomes, a high value had negative consequences (for example, the proportion of women who had no subjective improvement in MBL and proportion who had no improvement in quality of life). For ease of interpretation of the graphs, this means that results to the left of the line can be interpreted as favouring the experimental group, NSAIDs, and results to the right of the line favour the control or other comparison group.</P>
<P>Difficulties were encountered with the reporting of continuous outcomes (for example, MBL after treatment). Meta-analysis with RevMan software used a weighted mean difference (WMD) to combine outcomes and requires data to be presented as absolute values of post-treatment means with their standard deviations (or change values (either absolute or percentage) between baseline and final values together with the SD of the change). For many outcomes, particularly MBL, the data are skewed and authors correctly presented their data as medians with a range. Where possible, original data were obtained from the principal authors, but post-treatment means and standard deviations were not always either available or calculable. Where only medians and ranges were available and there was evidence that the data were approximately normally distributed, the median was regarded as being identical to the mean and an estimate of the standard deviation was calculated from the range ((range multiplied by 0.95)/4). Sensitivity analysis was performed with and without these studies in the meta-analysis to check the appropriateness of this assumption. Where there was strong evidence that the data were highly skewed and the sample size was small, it was considered inappropriate to regard the median as identical to the mean and the results of the relevant study were not combined in meta-analysis but reported separately in the Other Data section of this review. For all continuous outcomes, a high value had negative consequences and so results to the left of the line in the graphs favours the experimental group, NSAIDs, and results to the right of the line favour the control or other comparison group.</P>

<P>A number of studies were cross-over in design. In principle, cross-over and parallel group designed RCTs estimate the same effect but there are practical difficulties, such as carryover from the first treatment period and differences in the standard errors and so pooling the data from both types of trials was not considered appropriate. An option was to enter data from cross-over trials at the end of the first treatment period so that the two comparison groups were in effect parallel groups. Strenuous attempts were made to locate the original data at the end of the first cross-over trial period but for most of the cross-over trials these were unavailable.

All comparisons were between MFA and either placebo (two trials), another NSAID, naproxen (two trials) or other medical treatments: danazol, tranexamic acid, ethamsylate, oral contraceptive pill (OCP), norethisterone given during the luteal phase and the progesterone-releasing intrauterine system.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The age of the study participants in the 18 included trials ranged from 18 to 55 years and all had sought medical assistance for a complaint of HMB. In 10 of the studies, HMB was defined objectively by the alkaline haematin method to satisfy the criteria for inclusion. Some of the studies also required the women to have regular ovulatory cycles. Common exclusion criteria were hormonal contraception, intrauterine device (IUD) use, fibroids and pelvic pathology.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In general, the dosage regimen and duration did not vary extensively for each type of NSAID. MFA was most commonly studied and the usual dosage was 500 mg three times a day from onset of menses for four or five days or until menstruation ceased. Administration of MFA four or five days prior to menses until its cessation was required in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Eijkeren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Eijkeren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>) and a slightly different dosage (500 mg initially, then 250 mg four times per day for three to five days) was used in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Tsang-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 1987</LINK>). The dosage regimen for naproxen was very similar in the four studies: 500 mg at onset and three to five hours later, then 500 mg twice a day for five days (<LINK REF="STD-Ylikorkala-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ylikorkala 1986</LINK>); 500 mg in the morning, 250 mg in the afternoon for days one to two, then 250 mg twice a day for up to seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Rybo-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rybo 1981</LINK>); 500 mg then 250 mg three to four times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>); 550 mg initially, then 275 mg four times per day for five days (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1987</LINK>). The trial that compared MBL in patients treated with ibuprofen versus placebo used two different dosage regimens of ibuprofen: 600 mg daily and 1200 mg daily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>The duration of medication with tranexamic acid and ethamsylate was during the five days of menstruation. Danazol was given daily throughout the cycle. Oral progestogen were given as luteal phase supplementation in the included studies although a longer regimen is widely accepted as having greater efficacy. The progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)/levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) were inserted for the whole trial period and the OCP taken for three of the four weeks of the cycle. Duration of the intervention mostly ranged from two to three menstrual cycles but for the van Eijkeren trial the treatment phase was only one month.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For all trials but two, the main outcome was MBL measured objectively by the alkaline haematin method; in the remaining trials, the effect of treatment on MBL was assessed by the proportion of women experiencing "relief" of HMB (no details were given by the author as to how this was measured) (<LINK REF="STD-Grover-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Grover 1990</LINK>) or PBAC scores (<LINK REF="STD-Najam-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Najam 2010</LINK>). One trial also measured TMFL and PBAC scores in addition to MBL measured by the alkaline haematin method. Five trials assessed the effects of treatment on number of days of menstrual bleeding, eight trials measured the incidence of adverse events, three trials measured the effects on dysmenorrhoea, two assessed treatment acceptability and women's perception of change in MBL, and one trial measured non-adherence.<BR/>Adverse events were assessed in a number of ways. In some studies, the numbers of patients who suffered any adverse events were recorded. Other studies reported on the numbers of patients who suffered specific adverse events (for example headache, nausea, abdominal pain). One study attempted to combine specific adverse events in broad categories (for example gastrointestinal events and central nervous system events). Adverse events were either mentioned spontaneously by the patient or elicited by specific questioning such as "Do you think the treatment has upset you in any way?"</P>

<P>Two trials were excluded from the review. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1979</LINK>) assessed reduction in bleeding in the treatment and placebo groups according to the number of sanitary pads used compared to the baseline use of sanitary wear in the following categories (no change, one to three less, four to six less and seven to nine less). A weak positive correlation is only sometimes found between the number of pads and tampons used and the amount of MBL but this is often dependent on the personal hygiene of the woman and varies even between a woman's two menstruations of almost the same volume (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1984</LINK>).

In five of the seven post-treatment comparisons, the post-treatment mean MBL was significantly different from placebo.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from the one trial in the meta-analysis and five of the six cross-over studies confirms that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo in reducing MBL. However, the quality of the only study in the meta-analysis was not high; 42% of randomised patients dropped out and the analysis was not intention to treat. A highly significant difference between NSAIDs and placebo in reduction of MBL was also perceived by the patients in one study that recorded the proportion of patients who were relieved of their HMB as the primary outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">NSAIDs versus other medical treatments</HEADING>
<P>In the comparisons of NSAIDs as a group with other medical treatments, both tranexamic acid and danazol were more effective than any of the NSAIDs in reducing MBL. Results from the only study in the meta-analysis assessing the effect on MBL of NSAIDs versus tranexamic acid were confirmed by a cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Andersch-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Andersch 1988</LINK>). A significant reduction was also found in the meta-analysis of NSAIDs versus danazol in two included studies; the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1987</LINK>) had incomparable groups at baseline with a significantly higher (almost double) pre-treatment MBL in the danazol group and the results must be regarded with caution.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in reduction of MBL in the comparisons of NSAIDs with ethamsylate, oral progestogen given during the luteal phase, the progesterone-releasing IUS (Progestasert) and the OCP, although the trend in the MFA versus ethamsylate comparison and the MFA versus oral progestogen comparison suggested that MFA may be more effective (P = 0.0524; P = 0.0562). More studies comparing these treatments are needed.</P>
<P>The study comparing the progesterone-releasing IUS (Progestasert) was very small and results may have been affected by the lack of baseline comparability between groups. A newer progesterone releasing IUS (Mirena) was developed primarily as a contraceptive device and delivers 20 &#956;g of levonorgestrel per day. This device appeared to reduce both MBL and TMFL more effectively in one study. There is evidence that blood contributes only a third of the TMFL in normal women (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2001</LINK>). Thus, it could be argued that women may seek medical advice for excess total fluid loss (that is; blood and fluid) rather than blood loss per se. The study found high correlations between MBL and TMFL and the authors suggest that TMFL may be a more useful estimate of MBL because it is easier to measure. It remains to be demonstrated in future trials that women are more concerned about the volume rather than the composition of unacceptable menstrual loss.</P>
<P>In the comparisons of NSAIDs with other medical treatment, the number of days of menstrual bleeding was significantly shorter with danazol treatment and significantly longer with the progesterone releasing IUS (Progestasert) although this latter result was based on only one small trial. This outcome was not compared with oral contraceptive treatment.</P>
<P>Abdominal pain was more likely with LNG IUS than MFA in the short term (up to six months) but this side effect usually resolved over time (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>). Incidence of total adverse events was significantly more likely under danazol treatment. Although acceptability of treatment did not differ between danazol and MFA therapy (50% versus 47% refused to continue), the reasons given were not similar. About 80% of this group of danazol patients refused to continue because of adverse effects but 100% of the MFA group unwilling to continue were unhappy about the lack of efficacy of their treatment. A significantly greater proportion of women in the ethamsylate group compared to women in the NSAID group (MFA) found their treatment unacceptable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of individual NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>The clinical differences between individual NSAID preparations have not been previously explored thoroughly in randomised studies. Two studies in this review compared MFA with naproxen and no differences were found in post-treatment MBL or incidence of adverse events although women treated with MFA were less likely to have gastrointestinal effects. However, this latter finding, based on only one trial, is not supported by RCTs where NSAIDs are given for other medical conditions.</P>
<P>Although data comparing different types of NSAIDs were limited, there was no suggestion of differential efficacy, so in line with the widely accepted assumption that NSAIDs have similar clinical efficacy, studies comparing different NSAIDs with placebo or other treatments were combined.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tranexamic acid plus NSAIDs versus tranexamic acid alone</HEADING>
<P>The authors of one trial reported that three months of combined treatment significantly reduced PBAC scores from baseline, but not treatment with tranexamic acid alone. Comparison of groups by this type of analysis may be misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2011</LINK>) and these conclusions may not be reliable.</P>
<P>In spite of the limited data, it appears that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo but less effective than tranexamic acid, danazol or the LNG IUS in reducing HMB. However, adverse events are more frequent under danazol therapy than NSAID therapy. No trials were identified with data on cost or resource use of NSAID treatments.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:05:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of MBL is difficult because of cycle to cycle variation in women (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1977</LINK>). Haynes found that cycle-to-cycle variation was greater in patients with HMB (39 to 271 mL) than in women with normal menses. Consequently, trials were included in this review only if MBL (measured objectively) was greater than 80 mL per cycle for two or more cycles prior to the intervention although trials were also included where women had a subjective complaint of HMB. The alkaline haematin extraction method is the most commonly used objective method for assessment of blood loss and is used as the standard but a woman's own perception of her MBL is also important in the evaluation of effectiveness of treatment on MBL and so a woman's subjective assessment is also a valid assessment tool. However, many women who seek medical help for HMB will have normal blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2004b</LINK>) and results from one RCT have suggested that there is little response to therapy in women with MBL less than 35 mL (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1981</LINK>). Since a proportion of the study participants with a complaint of HMB had normal MBL, it is likely that some reported differences between treatment and placebo groups have been underestimated.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review have examined effects over two or three menstrual cycles of treatment and one study with unpublished data has assessed effects one month after treatment was withdrawn. There is no randomised evidence of effects over a longer period but one observational study has examined the effects of MFA in 34 women over a 16-month period and reported persistent reductions of 25% to 35% in MBL and improvement in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, different dosage regimens for some of the medical therapies were not considered in the included trials. A longer duration of oral progestogen treatment (from days five to 26 of the menstrual cycle), and longer duration of treatment over a number of cycles with all medical therapies are necessary to assess the comparisons considered in this review adequately.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:06:02 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although 18 trials met the criteria for inclusion, the inadequacies in some of the studies must be highlighted. The trials were all small and underpowered and for many outcomes the results were based on only one trial. Reduction of MBL in two of the nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1987</LINK>) that were included in the meta-analysis was correctly reported as a median and range in the publications since the distribution of data was positively skewed with one or more extremely high values. Substitution of the mean for the median and the estimation of the standard deviation for these studies has enabled their inclusion in the meta-analysis but sensitivity analysis with and without the inclusion of the Cameron trial has not altered results. The Hall study was the only trial comparing MBL after treatment with two NSAIDs, MFA and naproxen. The Mann-Whitney U test reported in the publication of the trial agreed with the results of the meta-analysis finding no significant difference between the groups.</P>
<P>Two of the included trials had incomparable groups at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>) but sensitivity analysis indicated that their inclusion in the meta-analysis did not substantially alter the results.</P>
<P>Assessments of carryover effects were made in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1987</LINK>). Fraser found in his cross-over trial of MFA and placebo, somewhat surprisingly, that the MBL during placebo cycles was greater (but not significantly) in the group that took MFA first. Of considerable interest was the finding that blood loss in the MFA cycles was significantly less (P &lt; 0.01) when placebo was taken first, so that MFA appeared to have a greater beneficial effect when taken after placebo. There was evidence of a small carryover effect but this did not reach statistical significance. Hall also tested for carryover effects but none were found (P = 0.96). It is generally believed that MBL returns to baseline levels very quickly after medical treatment is withdrawn and so the results from the cross-over trials were unlikely to be affected by carryover effects.</P>

<P>A comprehensive search for relevant studies has minimised the chance of publication bias, but this cannot be ruled out. There were too few studies for an analysis of funnel plots to be meaningful.

<P>No systematic reviews of NSAIDs were identified. However, evidence-based guidance from the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests that NSAIDs, together with tranexamic acid and OCPs, are a recommended second-line treatment option for women with HMB in whom either hormonal or non-hormonal treatments are acceptable. For women in whom hormonal treatment is not acceptable, NSAIDs are a first-line option alongside tranexamic acid (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:06:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review provides limited evidence of the efficacy of NSAIDs (of which the most commonly studied is MFA) as a treatment for reducing HMB in women with menorrhagia. However, the efficacy of NSAIDs is superseded by danazol, tranexamic acid and LNG IUS. Other medical treatments appear to be similarly effective compared to NSAIDs, although there is a suggestion that MFA may be more effective than either ethamsylate or oral progestogen. Danazol also reduces the number of days of menstrual bleeding but is more likely to cause adverse events when compared to NSAIDs. Gastrointestinal effects, which are often found with NSAID treatment, are less likely with MFA than naproxen. However, the benefits of NSAIDs that have been demonstrated in this review are modest; although MBL is reduced, a proportion of women will still have objective menorrhagia after treatment.</P>
<P>It is important to emphasise that a proportion of women with a convincing history of menorrhagia may not have excessive bleeding as defined by the alkaline haematin method. Treatments used to reduce blood loss in these women are not likely to be as effective.</P>
<P>The results of the review underscore the multiple assessments that are required in the evaluation of an optimum treatment. Efficacy is only one of these; other factors such as cost, convenience, beneficial and adverse effects on symptoms are also required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-22 08:06:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since MFA has been most commonly studied, further RCTs are required to compare individual NSAIDs so that the optimum treatment can be identified.</P>
<P>Because many of the analyses contained only one RCT, some of the comparisons were not able to be assessed thoroughly, in particular, the effects of NSAIDs on dysmenorrhoea, adherence to and acceptability of treatment and incidence of adverse events. However, since NSAIDs appear to be less efficacious than a number of other medical therapies, further RCTs are not likely to change the findings in this review significantly. Future studies comparing treatments for HMB should consider giving a longer duration of treatment over a number of cycles and a regimen of oral progestogen given during three of the four weeks of the cycle to assess comparative effects between medical treatments adequately. It is also possible that the addition of NSAIDs to other medical treatments may improve efficacy and further adequately designed trials are needed to explore this possibility.</P>
