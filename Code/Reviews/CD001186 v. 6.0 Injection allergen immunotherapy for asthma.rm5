No feel at present for number or frequency of injections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Severity of systemic reactions does need clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. There are some discrepancies between text and included studies tables in relation to allocation concealment. Sensitivity analysis based on allocation concealment as reported in the included studies has been added as extra analyses 1.13 and 1.14 (but I have not added any text; would the authors like to report these sensitivity analysis results)? Could the authors look at these and check the text of description of included studies as this does not seem to me to match up too well with what is in the included studies (I have therefore used the latter)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Sept 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for removing the per injection outcomes. This is ready for Peer review now. I have removed the What's new entry in relation to co-author's comments as this is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing of 2009 Update (April 23rd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the hard work on this update. I have tidied up the references to included studies and linked them to the text (et al has been removed as this is not recommended in the style guide)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you revisit outcomes 1.11 and 1.12? I do not understand the zero cells at the top of 1.11 as they do not match what has been entered in the 1.11.2 subgroup. The Per injection outcomes are NOT suitable for meta-analysis or entry into RevMan as each patient contributes more than once giving spurious levels of precision. I suggest removal of this outcome (except for the comments in the discussion in relation to prevalence). The variance and 95% for each trial shown in the forest plot are very misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;TJL: Mike has responded to the various points in the text.

ALSO IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A SHORT SUMMARY OF THE UPDATE INCLUDING THE NEW STUDIES INCLUDED AND WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS HAS MADE TO THE REVIEW?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Is one of the outcomes considered PRIMARY for the purposes of statistical analysis. (What matters most to the patients?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: I have tidied up all the included study references but not the excluded ones. WHAT ABOUT THE STUDIES AWAITING ASSESSMENT STILL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluded studies tidied up - I must apologise for the erratic punctuation which was due to directly importing citations from searches of the Airways Group database. There were 5 studies awaiting assessment, mainly responses from authors regarding missing methodological details. Four have now been excluded and one included.&lt;br&gt;{FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Concise but clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Graph defaults altered to SMD and random effects as reported in text, also RR and random or fixed for the dichotomous outcomes. Totals switched off for single study outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;It would be helpful to separate the original findings of the review from the updated findings (either here or in the What's new section or ideally both). So for example &amp;quot; Forty four trials were originally included in the review and 30 further trials have been included for this update. It would be good in the full results to report how many were excluded for the update as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Thanks for using Visual Rx to calculate the NNTs for the dichotomous results. There is a new version online using conservative rounding so I have used this to check the results and made slight alterations accordingly. I have taken the liberty of adding one or two of the graphical displays for the main NNT results as an additional figure to add colour to the review! This also has the advantage of showing the baseline risk alongside the impact of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for checking the NNTs. {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;See above for adjustment of NNTs using conservative rounding.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The effect was most marked for mite immunotherapy (SMD -1.14, 95%CI -1.62 to -0.65), similar for pollen (SMD -0.69, 95%CI -1.09 to -0.3) and animal dander (SMD -0.61, 95%CI -0.95 to -0.27), but not significant for other allergens.&amp;quot; This is OK but you have not formally tested for significant difference between subgroups. This can be done by adding the individual Chi totals from the subgroups and subtracting from the overall Chi (14.62 -7.97 = 6.65) and testing against 3 degrees of freedom (n-1 subgroups) and this does not achieve significance at the 5% level. &amp;quot; There was no significant difference between the results in the different subgroups (Chi 6.65, p=0.08).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point taken. {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: There seem to be 74 studies included now and 44 previously so how does this come to 20 new studies? I think that the potiential of serious side effects has been alluded to, but it would help to have some idea of the likelihood of this occuring. Could you add some information on this to help the reader please? Does anaphylaxis occur once in a million patients or one in a hundred for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 54 studies included in the 1998 version published in the Cochrane library. As now stated in the results, 2 previously included studies were excluded and 23 new studies included. This makes a total of 75 studies. See additional (2nd last) paragraph on adverse effects. {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Handling Heterogeneity; removing the three studies cited for the first outcome still leaves huge heterogeneity so I have removed this as a possible explanation of heterogeneity. It is not fair to suggest exclusion of studies on the basis of the RESULTS of that study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accepted. The more likely explanation is that almost no two studies scored symptoms or medication in the same way. This is explicitly offered as an explanation in the discussion. {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked; not yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done - mostly picked up authors' names and technical terms. I have also taken this opportunity to insert symbols, subscripts and superscripts. {FINE}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Mike Abramson to check out the changes I have made, and particularly put a short summary of the changes in the What's new section.&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike,&lt;br&gt;This looks great.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-24 09:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Injecting allergens under the skin (allergen specific immunotherapy) can reduce asthma and use of medication and improve the sensitivity of the lungs, but with a risk of severe reactions. Asthma attacks can be caused by allergies, pollens, cigarette smoke or air pollution and can be fatal. An allergen is a substance that causes an allergic reaction in a person sensitive to it. Allergen specific immunotherapy involves having injections of increasing amounts of the allergen under the skin. It is also called hyposensitisation or desensitisation, and there is a risk of severe allergic reactions. The review of trials found that immunotherapy can reduce asthma symptoms, the need for medications and the risk of severe asthma attacks after future exposure to the allergen. It is possibly as effective as inhaled steroids. However, there is an increased risk of a lump at the injection site, rash, wheezing, breathlessness and very rarely a fatal allergic reaction.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-17 10:27:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Eighty-eight trials were included (13 new trials). There were 42 trials of immunotherapy for house mite allergy; 27 pollen allergy trials; 10 animal dander allergy trials; two <I>Cladosporium</I> mould allergy, two latex and six trials looking at multiple allergens. Concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 16 of these trials. Significant heterogeneity was present in a number of comparisons. Overall, there was a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and medication, and improvement in bronchial hyper-reactivity following immunotherapy. There was a significant improvement in asthma symptom scores (standardised mean difference -0.59, 95% confidence interval -0.83 to -0.35) and it would have been necessary to treat three patients (95% CI 3 to 5) with immunotherapy to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms. Overall it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 6) with immunotherapy to avoid one requiring increased medication. Allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced allergen specific bronchial hyper-reactivity, with some reduction in non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity as well. There was no consistent effect on lung function. If 16 patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a local adverse reaction. If nine patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a systemic reaction (of any severity).</P>

<P>Immunotherapy reduces asthma symptoms and use of asthma medications and improves bronchial hyper-reactivity.  One trial found that the size of the benefit is possibly comparable to inhaled steroids.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-24 09:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Allergen specific immunotherapy ('hyposensitisation' or 'desensitisation') has long been a controversial treatment for asthma. Although beneficial effects upon clinically relevant outcomes have been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials, there remains a risk of severe and sometimes fatal anaphylaxis. The recommendations of professional bodies have ranged from cautious acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-TSANZ_x002f_ASCIA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSANZ/ASCIA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weeke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeke 1991</LINK>) to outright dismissal (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have previously conducted a meta-analysis of 20 double blind randomised controlled trials of allergen immunotherapy for asthma published between 1954 and 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 1995</LINK>). Subsequently we updated the systematic review to include 75 trials published between 1954 and 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2003</LINK>). Allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced asthma symptoms and treated patients were significantly less likely to report symptomatic deterioration. Allergen immunotherapy also significantly reduced medication requirements and treated patients were significantly less likely to require increased medication. There was no consistent effect on lung function.  There was an overall reduction in nonspecific bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR) following immunotherapy and treated patients were significantly less likely to develop increased BHR. There was an even greater homogeneous reduction in allergen specific BHR and treated patients were significantly less likely to develop increased allergen specific BHR. However, we did not extract data on adverse effects of immunotherapy.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of allergen immunotherapy are classified as local and systemic. There is no agreement in the literature as to what defines a local adverse reaction (LR), apart from the proviso that it occurs in the immediate vicinity of the site of the injection. Systemic reactions are further reported as systemic reactions not further classified (usually wheezing and urticaria) (SR), near-fatal reactions (severe hypotension and/or severe dyspnoea) (NFR) and fatal reactions (FR).  While this classification does not use the term anaphylaxis, it is clear that near-fatal reactions as described do constitute anaphylaxis. The problem lies in the recognition of mild anaphylaxis as a term sometimes applied to significant wheezing and/or urticaria without hypotension, severe dyspnoea or collapse.</P>
<P>In recent years there has been increasing interest in new allergen preparations, such as allergen-antibody complexes and new methods of delivery including oral, sublingual and inhaled immunotherapy. Recombinant peptides containing the relevant epitopes, but lacking the ability to crosslink IgE bound to mast cells, have been evaluated in clinical trials. Finally the Cochrane Collaboration has continued to improve the statistical software for performing meta-analysis. Thus, it was again time to update our systematic review of allergen specific immunotherapy for asthma.</P>

<P>This review was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which provide the strongest evidence for the efficacy of any medical treatment. Placebo controlled trials are methodologically stronger, although studies which have administered house dust or relatively antigenically inactive preparations to the control group were also considered.  Double blinded trials were preferred, but single blind and open studies were also reviewed for possible inclusion.</P>
<P>We considered studies published in languages other than English if the translated abstract indicated that the study was a RCT of allergen immunotherapy for asthma and a translator was sought (see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2009-11-24 09:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details). All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'asthma' were searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>immunotherap* or hyposensit* or desensit*</P>
<P>We also undertook MEDLINE searches from 1950 to 2005 for studies of immunotherapy and asthma. We surveyed review articles identified in this process for additional and earlier citations.  We also searched dissertation abstracts and Current Contents to identify more recently published and unpublished studies.</P>
<P>The searches in this review are current to August 2005. Searches covering the period 2005 to 2008 are currently being assessed.</P>

<P>These comparisons were performed separately for each primary outcome, namely asthma symptoms, medication, lung function, non-specific BHR and allergen specific BHR, whenever the results were reported. Comparisons were also performed for adverse events when these were reported.</P>
<P>Outcome data were extracted and entered into RevMan 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) for statistical analysis. We analysed categorical outcomes as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) calculated for individual studies. The relative risk is the ratio between the immunotherapy and control groups for the risk of subjects being the same or worse after treatment. The convention of the Cochrane Collaboration is to consider a RR &gt; 1 as indicating clinically undesirable outcomes (in this review, worse symptoms, increased medication, deteriorating lung function and increased nonspecific and allergen specific BHR). The combined relative risks were then used to estimate the number of patients who would need to be treated (NNT(B)) to avoid these undesirable outcomes. The combined relative risks of adverse events were used to estimate the number of treated patients who would be harmed (NNT(H)) by immunotherapy. We used visual Rx 3.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Visual-Rx-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visual Rx 2008</LINK>) to calculate NNT(B) and NNT(H).</P>
<P>We also extracted continuous outcomes (symptom and medication scores, lung function parameters and indices of nonspecific and allergen specific BHR) from tables of results. Where the results were only presented in graphs, these were digitised and then converted to numbers with Un-Scan-It v4.0 (Silk Scientific Corporation 1996, <LINK REF="REF-Un_x002d_Scan_x002d_It-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Un-Scan-It 1996</LINK>). We analysed continuous outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMD). The SMD is a statistic which expresses the difference in means between immunotherapy and control groups in units of the pooled standard deviation. We chose the SMD because many studies measured the same outcomes on different scales.</P>
<P>We generally used fixed-effect models to obtain summary statistics for the overall efficacy of allergen immunotherapy upon both categorical and continuous outcomes and performed Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests to assess heterogeneity between studies. In this context, a P value &lt; 0.05 indicated significant differences between studies and raised questions as to whether the results could be meaningfully combined. We also expressed heterogeneity as the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic which measures the proportion of inconsistency between studies that could not be explained by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). When significant heterogeneity was found, we recalculated the overall efficacy using random-effects models, which provided more realistic estimates of the confidence intervals under these circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-et-al-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau et al 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Eighty-eight randomised controlled trials published in 98 papers between 1954 and 2005 were identified which satisfied the inclusion criteria (2009 update: 13 new trials). The methods, participants, interventions and outcomes of included studies are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. A total of 3792 patients (3459 with asthma) were involved. There were 42 studies reporting immunotherapy for mite allergy, generally <I>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</I> or <I>D. farinae</I>, although <LINK REF="STD-Armentia-Medina-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Armentia Medina 1995</LINK> used extracts of the storage mite <I>Lepidoglyphus destructor</I>. Three early studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aas-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Aas 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1968" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vooren-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Vooren 1969</LINK>) used extracts of house dust. There were 27 studies of immunotherapy for pollen allergy, utilising extracts of Bermuda grass, orchard grass/cocksfoot, Timothy grass, velvet grass, sweet vernal grass, perennial rye grass, birch, olive or ragweed pollen. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sin 1996</LINK>) included separate groups of patients with mite and pollen allergy. Ten studies reported immunotherapy for animal dander allergy, particularly to cats and dogs. Two studies utilised extracts of the mould <I>Cladosporium</I>, two used latex extracts and six attempted simultaneous immunotherapy for multiple aeroallergens. Four studies from one group of investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1993</LINK>) used allergen-antibody complexes for immunotherapy.</P>
<P>We excluded a further 222 studies (2009 update: 56 new studies). The most common reasons were that the studies were: not controlled (64), not randomised (41), involved subjects with rhinitis rather than asthma (30), did not report clinically relevant outcomes (11) or were not analysed by intention-to-treat (one). There were two Phase I studies, a trial of withdrawing immunotherapy and two of homeopathy. We identified many new clinical trials of oral immunotherapy (13), inhaled or intranasal immunotherapy (eight) and particularly sublingual immunotherapy (49), some of which have been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Calamita-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calamita 2006</LINK>). Finally, there were 12 abstracts which contained insufficient information for any further assessment.</P>

<P>We assessed concealment of allocation as clearly adequate (category A) in only 16 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aas-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Aas 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00f8_dtger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bødtger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousquet-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Bousquet 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousquet-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bousquet 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bousquet-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bousquet 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cantani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cantani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creticos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creticos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maestrelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maestrelli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosbech-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mosbech 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valovirta-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Valovirta 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varney-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2001</LINK>). The adequacy or otherwise of 57 studies could not be determined from the details published in the papers (category B) and further information was sought from the authors, but rarely forthcoming. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haugaard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Haugaard 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1991</LINK>) used a clearly inadequate method for concealment of allocation (category C). Concealment was not reported in 13 open studies (category D). There was almost perfect agreement between authors.</P>
<P>The overall methodological quality of the included trials was moderate. Only six trials (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f8_dtger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bødtger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnstone-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Johnstone 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnstone-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Johnstone 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sastre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sastre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 1991</LINK>) received the maximum score of five out of five. Sixteen trials scored four points, 32 trials three points, 23 trials two points and 11 trials one point. Blinding of subjects and/or evaluators is a design feature that reduces bias in randomised controlled trials.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Symptom scores were reported by 35 studies, although <LINK REF="STD-Dreborg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dreborg 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mungan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mungan 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leynadier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leynadier 2000</LINK> did not publish standard deviations (SD) thus preventing the calculation of the standardised mean differences (SMD) for these studies. The combined SMD for symptom scores following mite immunotherapy was &#8211;0.48 with a 95% confidence interval from -0.96 to 0.0 thus indicating a borderline reduction in asthma symptoms. The combined SMD following pollen immunotherapy was -0.61 (95% CI -0.87 to -0.35) indicating significant symptomatic improvement. However there was no significant improvement following immunotherapy with cat, dog or multiple allergen extracts. For all allergens combined, the SMD was -0.59 (95% CI -0.83 to -0.35), but there was high heterogeneity between studies (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 119, P &lt; 0.00001, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 90%). In part this may have been due to studies by <LINK REF="STD-Franco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franco 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Varney-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varney 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Basomba-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Basomba 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bruce-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Adkinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adkinson 1997</LINK> not finding any reduction in symptoms.</P>
<P>Symptoms were simply reported as worse, the same or improved in 26 studies. Overall it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 5) with immunotherapy to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Symptoms were significantly more likely to improve following immunotherapy with extracts of pollen (NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 16), animal dander (NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 18) and other allergens (NNT 3; 95% CI 3 to 4). A smaller improvement was seen following mite immunotherapy where six patients (95% CI 4 to 16) would have to be treated to avoid one deteriorating.  There was moderate heterogeneity between the results of all studies (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 44, Lp = 0.003, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51.8%), with <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1979" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1981</LINK> actually finding symptoms to be more likely in treated patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Medication</HEADING>
<P>Asthma medication scores were reported by 21 studies, with <LINK REF="STD-Mungan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mungan 1999</LINK> failing to publish the SD. The combined SMD was -0.53 (95% CI -0.80 to -0.27) indicating a significant reduction in medication following immunotherapy. Medication requirements were simply reported as increased, unchanged or decreased in 17 studies.  Overall it would have been necessary to treat five patients (95% CI 4 to 7) with immunotherapy to avoid one requiring increased medication (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Although there was moderate heterogeneity between the studies reporting medication scores (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 57.3, P &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 66.9%), there was substantial homogeneity within the latter group. Together, these findings suggest that some of the heterogeneity in medication scores may have been due to the different methods of collecting these data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lung function</HEADING>
<P>Lung function results were reported by 20 studies, with many studies failing to provide SDs for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Gaddie-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Gaddie 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1993</LINK>), Thoracic Gas Volume (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1978</LINK>) or Peak Expiratory Flow (<LINK REF="STD-Dreborg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dreborg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rak-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rak 2001</LINK>).  Data for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and PEF could be aggregated in meta-analyses. There was no overall difference between treatment groups, but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 41.4, P &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 80.7%).  In seven studies, lung function was simply reported as worse, the same or improved. Although there was homogeneity between these studies and an overall trend suggesting an improvement in lung function following immunotherapy, this did not achieve statistical significance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bronchial hyper-reactivity</HEADING>
<P>Indices of nonspecific bronchial hyper-reactivity were reported by 18 studies. The combined results varied significantly with the challenge agent (heterogeneity Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 30.4, P = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 44.1%). There was a marginal improvement in PD<SUB>20</SUB> FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to methacholine and <LINK REF="STD-Machiels-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Machiels 1990a</LINK> reported an improvement in PC<SUB>35</SUB>SGaw to acetylcholine following immunotherapy with allergen-antibody complexes. However, there were no significant changes in PC<SUB>20</SUB>FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to histamine challenge or the change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to cold air. Nonetheless there was an overall modest reduction in nonspecific BHR following immunotherapy (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.11) corresponding to a 2.2 fold (95% CI 1.3 to 3.9) increase in PD<SUB>20.</SUB>
</P>
<P>Nonspecific BHR was simply reported as increased, unchanged or reduced in five small studies. There was homogeneity between these studies and patients randomised to immunotherapy were significantly less likely to develop increased nonspecific BHR than those randomised to placebo. Overall it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 6) with immunotherapy to avoid worsening BHR in one (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Indices of allergen specific BHR (such as PD<SUB>20</SUB> FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to allergen challenge) were reported by 19 studies. There was homogeneity between these studies with an overall SMD of -0.61 (95% CI -0.79 to -0.43) indicating a significant reduction in allergen specific BHR following immunotherapy. This corresponded to a 4.1 fold (95% CI 2.7 to 6.2) increase in PD<SUB>20</SUB>.  The effect was most marked for mite immunotherapy (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.58), similar for pollen (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.27) and animal dander (SMD -0.61, 95% CI &#8211;0.95 to -0.27), but not significant for other allergens.</P>
<P>Allergen specific BHR was simply reported as increased, unchanged or reduced in 16 studies. There was homogeneity between studies and patients randomised to immunotherapy were significantly less likely to develop increased allergen specific BHR. Overall, it would have been necessary to treat four patients (95% CI 3 to 5) to avoid worsening allergen specific BHR in one (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse reactions</HEADING>
<P>Large local adverse reactions were reported by 16 studies comparing immunotherapy with placebo. The pooled relative risk was 1.4 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.02) and homogeneous in the 10 studies that reported reactions per patient. Thus if 16 patients were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a local reaction.  </P>
<P>Systemic adverse reactions were reported by 32 studies.  Systemic reactions were defined as any of anaphylaxis, asthma, rhinitis or urticaria, or any combination of these. The pooled relative risk was 2.45 (95% CI 1.91 to 3.13) in the 26 reporting reactions per patient and this was relatively homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%). Thus if nine patients (95% CI 6 to 14) were treated with immunotherapy, one would be expected to develop a systemic reaction (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Because of the small number and disparate outcomes reported by the non-placebo controlled randomised trials, only limited meta-analysis could be performed. <LINK REF="STD-Choovoravech-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Choovoravech 1974</LINK> did not find a significant reduction in asthma symptoms comparing house dust mite (HDM) immunotherapy with house dust. However, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Maunsell-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Maunsell 1971</LINK> indicated that three patients (95% CI 2 to 18) would have to be treated with HDM immunotherapy to avoid one reporting worse asthma symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Choovoravech-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Choovoravech 1974</LINK> did not find any significant reduction in asthma medications following immunotherapy.</P>
<P>The three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aas-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Aas 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1968" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vooren-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Vooren 1969</LINK>) that compared house dust extracts with placebo found negative results for most outcomes. Subjects randomised to house dust were less likely to report worse asthma symptoms, but the combined effect did not achieve statistical significance. In the <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1968" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1968</LINK> study those randomised to house dust had minimal reduction in asthma medication and no real change in lung function. However, <LINK REF="STD-Aas-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Aas 1971</LINK> found that asthmatic children randomised to house dust had significantly reduced allergen specific BHR, so four children (95% CI 3 to 9) would have to be treated to avoid one deteriorating.</P>
<P>On the other hand, studies with untreated controls reported strongly positive results of allergen immunotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Bousquet-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bousquet 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Ortega-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Ortega 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1998</LINK> found that patients randomised to immunotherapy demonstrated significant reductions in asthma symptoms (combined SMD -1.8, 95% CI -3.2 to -0.5) and medication (SMD -2.5, 95% CI -3.1 to -2.0) and even a significant improvement in lung function (combined SMD = -0.8, 95% CI -0.4 to -1.2).  <LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1998</LINK> also reported a significant reduction in non-specific BHR (SMD -2.2, 95% CI -3.6 to -0.7). <LINK REF="STD-Bertelsen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bertelsen 1989</LINK> also found that patients randomised to immunotherapy were marginally less likely to develop increased allergen specific BHR. Although <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Ortega-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Ortega 1993</LINK> found a significant improvement in allergen specific BHR following immunotherapy, <LINK REF="STD-Kohno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kohno 1998</LINK> did not, so that the combined effect was not significant.</P>
<P>The only trial to directly compare allergen immunotherapy with inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 1997</LINK>) found that symptom scores and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> rose more rapidly in the group randomised to budesonide. However, as no standard deviations were reported, it was not possible to calculate standardised mean differences. In any case, there were no other trials with which these results could be meaningfully combined.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-13 01:33:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated systematic review of allergen immunotherapy for asthma has identified an additional 13 randomised controlled trials, which were not covered by our previous Cochrane Review of studies published up to 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2003</LINK>). The most common reason for these studies not being included previously was that they were published after 2001. However, in some cases we were awaiting confirmation that allocation of treatment was randomised or other methodological details. Most of the non-English language publications on allergen immunotherapy were not randomised controlled trials. A total of 222 studies were excluded from this review, predominantly because they were not randomised, not controlled, did not report clinically relevant outcomes or only involved subjects with rhinitis. </P>
<P>Given the well-recognised bias favouring the publication of positive studies, it is quite possible that some additional negative studies have been conducted, but that their results have not been published in the medical literature. This problem could be avoided in the future by prospective registration of all clinical trials of allergen immunotherapy, as has been attempted in other clinical disciplines. Unfortunately the methodological quality of most studies, particularly the concealment of allocation following randomisation, could not be clearly determined from the information presented in the papers. We would encourage authors of future papers to follow the revised <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK> guidelines and fully report such details.</P>
<P>This meta-analysis has confirmed that allergen specific immunotherapy can significantly reduce asthma symptoms and medication requirements. The heterogeneity of symptom and medication scores may have arisen, in part, from the different scoring schemes used in different studies, since changes in lung function or bronchial hyper-reactivity reported as dichotomous outcomes did not show heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in medication and symptom scores remained significant after stratifying for the allergen administered. Standardisation of asthma symptom and medication scores is required for easier interpretation of future studies. However, we do not believe that the heterogeneity of the results means that the studies could not be meaningfully combined or invalidates the conclusions.</P>
<P>Medication requirements which were reported as categories, in contrast to the analysis using medication scores, showed significant homogeneity. We believe that this finding can translate into a clinically useful outcome, as one of the principal aims of attempting allergen immunotherapy is to decrease medication requirements. Whilst inhaled corticosteroid therapy remains the mainstay of asthma management, any reduction in this type of treatment while maintaining good asthma control would be welcome.</P>
<P>There was no consistent effect of immunotherapy upon lung function and there was significant heterogeneity in the trials that reported peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements. Unlike the previous review, we did not infer standard deviations (SDs) from studies of normal subjects, because they were more likely to have more reproducible measurements than asthmatic patients. In the current analysis, the point estimates of PEF from the different studies are distributed around the line of no difference, two studies falling to one side and five to the other.</P>
<P>As in the previous Cochrane Review, nonspecific and allergen specific BHR were analysed separately. Patients randomised to immunotherapy were significantly less likely to develop increased nonspecific BHR, and there were modest improvements in indices of nonspecific BHR. Since indices of BHR are generally considered to follow a log normal distribution, the means and standard deviations of Log PD<SUB>20</SUB> were entered into RevMan to calculate the SMD.</P>
<P>Allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced allergen specific BHR. Stratifying the meta-analysis for the allergen administered and expressing the results as Log PD<SUB>20</SUB> achieved homogeneity. It would be desirable for future studies to use a standardised protocol for bronchial allergen challenges and to report the results in a more consistent fashion. Not surprisingly it would appear that allergen immunotherapy has a greater effect upon allergen specific BHR than upon nonspecific BHR.</P>
<P>The finding that allergen immunotherapy significantly and homogeneously improves allergen specific bronchial BHR is clinically important. Patients with brittle extrinsic (allergic) asthma are at risk of sudden deterioration when exposed to increased levels of an aeroallergen to which they are sensitive. An intervention that reduces the risk of an acute episode of asthma under these circumstances may be clinically useful. Currently, the measurement of allergen specific BHR is the only accurate method of assessing such a risk.</P>
<P>Less importance should be attached to the results of the relatively small number of non-placebo controlled trials. There is some evidence that house dust mite extracts may reduce asthma symptoms and allergen specific BHR compared to house dust extracts. One study even suggested that house dust extracts alone could reduce allergen specific BHR, challenging the view that such extracts are antigenically inactive. However, taken together these results are consistent with the greater efficacy of house dust mite extracts compared with placebo. Studies with untreated controls are particularly susceptible to bias and may overestimate the true benefit of treatment. The effects of immunotherapy upon symptoms, medication and lung function found in one such study are beyond the upper confidence limits for placebo controlled studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>While adverse effects of allergen immunotherapy have been well-described over the previous half-century, such reports have usually been case reports, prospective or retrospective reviews of case series, or structured databases set up by specialist allergy societies to which practising allergists report adverse effects on a voluntary basis. As expected, the incidence of reported adverse effects thus varies according to the reporting method, but a representative estimate of this problem is summarised in the table below (<LINK REF="REF-Amin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tankersley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tankersley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tinkleman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinkleman 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The incidence of local reactions (LR) per patient is comparable to that in the literature, although we suspect that they may have been under-reported in those studies that did not report any. The incidence of systemic reactions (SR) per patient is far greater than that reported in the literature (19.9% compared to 5% to 7%) and this estimate was relatively homogeneous. However without information on grading of these reactions, we cannot analyse further, except to say that we consider that mild systemic reactions may have previously been under-reported.</P>
<P>The systemic reaction rates reported among patients receiving placebo (8.1% of patients and 3.7% of injections) are intriguing. Most placebo preparations contained an ingredient to cause itch (such as histamine) so as to mimic an active dose. This may have caused an over-reaction, such as hyper-ventilation, in susceptible subjects, and such subjects may have reported dyspnoea or wheezing, or skin symptoms.</P>
<P>We conclude that allergen immunotherapy by injection is not without risk of significant systemic adverse effects and clinicians should weigh up carefully the pros and cons of this intervention. We also conclude that systemic adverse effects may be under-reported in the literature. We await similar analysis for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) as that intervention has promises of reduced serious adverse effects while maintaining efficacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Authors' conclusions</HEADING>
<P>The results of this systematic review are consistent with our previous Cochrane Review and our original conclusions have not been overturned by the inclusion of 13 additional randomised controlled trials of allergen immunotherapy. In the initial meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 1995</LINK>) we intuitively calculated the combined odds ratios for symptomatic improvement, reduction in medication and BHR. These odds ratios can be converted to the Cochrane convention of clinically unfavourable outcomes being greater than one by taking their reciprocals. When the reciprocals are compared with the odds ratios from the present review, the results are strikingly similar and in all cases lie within the 95% confidence intervals. We have expressed the effect on dichotomous outcomes as NNT. These numbers are small and compare favourably with other preventive treatments for asthma. Furthermore, the overall effects of immunotherapy upon continuous outcomes (effect size or SMD) are also comparable between reviews.</P>

<P>The evidence assembled in this review confirms the efficacy of immunotherapy in terms of a reduction in asthma symptoms and use of asthma medication, but it gives limited guidance concerning the size of benefit compared to other therapies. For example, it is not confidently known whether the effect is the same in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids as in those who are not. The data show that immunotherapy can be considered when asthma is extrinsic and an unavoidable clinically relevant allergen can be identified. A specific effective extract should be used and there should be flexibility in the dosage schedule. Patients should be informed that subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy is not without risk of significant adverse effects. They must be observed long enough to deal with any major systemic reactions (typically 45 minutes) and adequate resuscitation measures must be available because of the well-known possibility of anaphylaxis. There must be access to expert advice at all times. Finally, patients should be informed that other types of allergen immunotherapy, such as sublingual immunotherapy, are available, and patients should be allowed an informed choice as to which intervention they would prefer.</P>
