<P>There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether acupuncture provides any effect when treating people with vascular dementia. Acupuncture is used to treat vascular dementia, but because no randomized controlled trials of acupuncture versus placebo were found its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-02 03:07:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia is a widespread condition characterized by acquired global impairment of intellect, memory and personality, but not impairment of consciousness. The prevalence of moderate and severe dementia is approximately 5% in people aged 65 years and over (<LINK REF="REF-Jorm-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorm 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). Vascular dementia is defined as loss of cognitive function resulting from ischaemic, hypoperfusive, or haemorrhagic brain lesions due to cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2003</LINK>). The frequency varies depending on the study population, screening methodology, diagnostic criteria, and time period (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1994</LINK>). In the United States and Europe it is generally believed that vascular dementia is the second leading cause (10% to 20% of cases) (<LINK REF="REF-Udea-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udea 1992</LINK>) of progressive and irreversible dementia, while Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause (50% to 60% of cases). However, in many Asian and developing countries, researchers have found the opposite (<LINK REF="REF-Tian-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tian 1997</LINK>). In China, vascular dementia accounts for more than 68% of the total number of people aged over 65 years with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1998</LINK>).The causes of death are complications of dementia, cardiovascular disease, and miscellaneous causes, including malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The average duration of vascular dementia is five years, the survival rate being much lower than for patients with Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1995</LINK>). The risk of vascular dementia has been examined with respect to age, gender, race and ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1997</LINK>), education level (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tatemichi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatemichi 1992</LINK>), genetic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Bousser-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousser 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slooter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slooter 1997</LINK>), atherogenic risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Desmond-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshitake-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshitake 1995</LINK>), stoke-related factors (<LINK REF="REF-Charletta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charletta 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tatemichi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatemichi 1993</LINK>), periventricular white matter lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pantoni-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pantoni 1997</LINK>), silent cerebral infarcts (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1994</LINK>), heart rhythm abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1998</LINK>), and other factors (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoog-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoog 1998</LINK>). Among these factors age, hypertension, genetic factors, and stroke-related characteristics are the only well documented risk factors for vascular dementia at present (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A set of eight vascular dementia subgroups has been established by Loeb and Meyer (<LINK REF="REF-Loeb-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeb 1996</LINK>):<BR/>(1) multi-infarct dementias;<BR/>(2) strategically placed infarctions causing dementia;<BR/>(3) multiple subcortical lacunar lesions;<BR/>(4) Binswanger's disease;<BR/>(5) mixtures of two or more of the above vascular dementia subtypes;<BR/>(6) haemorrhagic lesions causing dementia;<BR/>(7) subcortical dementias due to cerebral autosomally dominant arteriolopathy with subcortical infarcts and leuko-encephalopathy (CADASIL);<BR/>(8) mixtures of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.</P>
<P>The neuropathologic substrate of vascular dementia in relation to subcortical white matter changes, either focal infarcts or widespread diffuse changes, which has been emphasized (<LINK REF="REF-Erkinjuntii-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkinjuntii 1996</LINK>). It is believed that these lesions may be an important cause of vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Nyenhuis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyenhuis 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neuropsychological research on vascular dementia has attempted to define the pattern of cognitive impairments and to compare it with the patterns of other dementia syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Benthem-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benthem 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bogdanoff-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogdanoff 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Starkstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starkstein 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villardita-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villardita 1993</LINK>). However, much of this work has been difficult to replicate (<LINK REF="REF-Gfeller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gfeller 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metter-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metter 1993</LINK>). Neuropathologic findings show that patients with vascular dementia demonstrate more psychiatric impairment, which differs in different ethnic groups (<LINK REF="REF-Sultzer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultzer 1993</LINK>), including more behavioural retardation, depression, and anxiety.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>So far there is no definitive medical or surgical treatment for vascular dementia. Most of the current approaches to treatment focus on the mobilization of remaining cognitive and functional capacities as well as the possible prevention of further disease progression. The aim of therapy is to optimize patients' autonomy, activities of daily living, and quality of life. The prevention of stroke is also an important aim, to prevent further morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Gorelick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorelick 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the field of medication, drugs with well-proven effects are still lacking. There are many kinds of Chinese herbal medicines, such as Yizhi capsule, and self-made decoctions are used for treating vascular dementia in China (<LINK REF="REF-Libin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shihao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shihao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taixiang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taixiang 2005</LINK>) but there is no firm conclusions about their effectiveness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acupuncture for vascular dementia</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese method which has been used for both the prevention and treatment of diseases for over 3000 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ulett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulett 1998</LINK>). It is becoming increasingly popular in high-income countries as a therapy for a wide variety of disorders, most of which are chronic and difficult to manage with conventional treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Helene-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helene 2001</LINK>). At the same time, its mechanism of action remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Lo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 2003</LINK>). In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the general principles of acupuncture treatment include regulating the Yin and Yang, strengthening body resistance and eliminating pathogenic factors, and distinguishing the primary physical and pathological factors from the secondary ones (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2000</LINK>). In recent years many reports have shown that acupuncture has effects on the pituitary gland and adrenal cortex system, the sympathetic nervous and adrenal medulla system, the pituitary gland and thyroid gland system, and the posterior pituitary system (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many kinds of acupuncture methods, such as body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture and electroacupuncture, are in use for the treatment of vascular dementia in hospitals in China. Body acupuncture is a generalised term for acupuncture and is in common use with reference to acupuncture therapy. It means treating disease by applying acupuncture to points along the channels of the human body. Scalp acupuncture is a therapeutic method for treating diseases associated with the nervous system by using acupuncture needles along the surface of the head. Electroacupuncture is a therapeutic method combining acupuncture with electrical stimulation. Acupuncture therapy combined with medication is also used. Body acupuncture and electroacupuncture are the most commonly used techniques. However, the effectiveness and side-effects of acupuncture for vascular dementia have not been systematically reviewed.</P>

<P>The following three areas were to be addressed, since there is some evidence that these are associated with biased estimates of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>):<BR/>a) randomisation (method of generation and concealment of allocation);<BR/>b) masking (blinding of observers and participants to the treatment allocation);<BR/>c) loss to follow-up (presence of dropouts and withdrawals, and the analysis of these).</P>
<P>The quality assessment was to include an evaluation of the following components for each included study. Each component was categorised as 'Adequate', 'Unclear', or 'Inadequate'. The randomization criteria were as suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomization (allocation generation) - adequate when the allocation sequence protects against biased allocation to the comparison groups.</LI>
<LI>Randomization (allocation concealment) - adequate when clinicians and participants are unaware of future allocations.</LI>
<LI>Masking - adequate when the outcome assessor is unaware of the allocation.</LI>
<LI>Loss to follow-up - adequate when more than 80% of participants are followed up, then analyzed in the groups to which they were originally randomized (intention to treat).</LI>
</UL>
<P>A description of the quality of each study was given based on a summary of these components. Studies with adequate information were included and studies with inadequate information were excluded. If there was insufficient information to rate risk of bias items, then study authors were contacted for further information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>This was to be performed by two review authors (YW and YZ), who independently entered data onto a data extraction form. Discrepancies were to be resolved by a third review author (WP). Missing data were to be obtained from authors by e-mail or phone call. Data were to be checked and entered into RevMan by two review authors (YW and CL).</P>
<P>Data were to be extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics for continuous data required for each trial and each outcome were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were to be extracted, if available.</P>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the intention was that data would be treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were to be sought.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were to be sought on every patient randomized. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were to be sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, 'on-treatment' or the data of those who completed the trial were to be sought and indicated as such.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome would be the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation, when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio was to be used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials was to be calculated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomization were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity was to be assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Duration of trials may vary considerably. If the range was considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis, trials with similar durations would be grouped together and a separate meta-analysis would be conducted for each duration of treatment. Some trials might contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments were done. Data that had been recorded after treatment of less than two weeks would be considered as reflecting short-term benefit. This would be analyzed separately from data that had been recorded for over a period of one month, which reflects a reasonable minimal time period to capture some aspect of disease chronicity.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference were to be presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model would be presented and a test for heterogeneity using an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic would be performed. If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results would be pooled or a random-effects model would be used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>
<P>Studies relating to adverse effects were to be described qualitatively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analysis would be performed where adequate information was given in included studies. The subgroups would be body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, and electroacupuncture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were intended to examine the effects of excluding those studies with lower methodological quality. If there are adequate number of studies, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If enough studies were found, then potential reporting biases would be investigated using the funnel plot or other analytical methods according to <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>

<P>The reasons for exclusion were as follows.<BR/>1) Twenty-one studies used inadequate control methods: the control group of 14 studies received some type of Western medicine including aniracetam capsules (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>), nimodipine (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2008</LINK>), dihydroergotoxine (DHET) (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2001a</LINK>), hydergine (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2007</LINK>), low molecular weight dextran plus composite Salvia injection (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>), huperzine A tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>), abu nidal plus hydergine (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007</LINK>), duxil (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2008a</LINK>); two studies compared acupuncture plus duxil with duxil (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>); one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007c</LINK>) compared acupuncture plus Xinkang capsules with Xinkang capsules; two studies divided participants into three groups comparing acupuncture with acupuncture plus nimodipine (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK>) or Xinnaojing drip (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2008</LINK>) and the same medicine; two studies were comparisons of two acupuncture methods (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological limitations of trials</HEADING>
<P>1) Twenty-eight studies mentioned randomization, but just two described the randomization procedure and allocation concealment in detail. Both of these were adequately randomized, using block randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2007</LINK>) and computer randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK>). Authors of the remaining 26 studies were asked to describe their methods of randomization and allocation. E-mail and telephone correspondence with the authors revealed that 15 studies used adequate randomization and seven studies did not. The authors of final four studies could not be contacted.</P>
<P>Methods of sequence generation used in the additional 15 adequately randomized studies were: random number table randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007c</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>), computer randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2006</LINK>) and block randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2001a</LINK>). All of these studies used adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Problems with randomization in the seven studies where this was judged inadequate were: pseudo-random allocation by entry sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007b</LINK>) and inadequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Lun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lun 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Niu 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study report (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2006</LINK>) mentioned blinding of participants and data analysts.<B> </B>By contacting authors we found that data analysts were blinded in a further 21 studies.</P>
<P>2) Twenty-four studies used methods with uncertain efficacy as controls. The various control interventions used are listed above under 'Excluded studies'. None of these interventions has convincing evidence of efficacy, making it impossible to draw conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. For example, it is possible that these 'control' interventions made patients worse than a placebo would have done, thereby leading to an apparent treatment effect. Placebo or no intervention would have been an appropriate control. Sixteen studies compared acupuncture with drug treatment.</P>
<P>Four studies compared acupuncture plus a drug treatment (duxil (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>), intravenous cerebrolysin (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007b</LINK>), Xinkiang (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007c</LINK>)) with acupuncture alone. It is difficult to assess the efficacy of acupuncture if acupuncture is combined with drugs in the intervention group. An interaction between drugs and acupuncture is possible.</P>
<P>Two studies had both of the above limitations, by dividing  participants into three groups: acupuncture, drug (nimodipine (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=70768490023367350815110622110320&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Zhang-2008">Zhang 2008</A>), Xinnaojing drip (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=70768490023367350815110622110320&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Peng-2008">Peng 2008</A>)) and acupuncture plus drug.</P>
<P>The final two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2007</LINK>) compared two acupuncture methods.</P>
<P>3) None of the studies used comprehensive sets of outcome measures. Quality of life and mood are absent. Only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2008</LINK>) mentioned adverse events or side effects. It described only one participant experiencing dizziness and nausea, which resolved shortly after removal of the needles.</P>
<P>4)The number of participants in individual studies is generally low, ranging from 10 to 82 patients. That cannot give powerful evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for vascular dementia.</P>

<P>Although acupuncture is widely used to treat vascular dementia in China, and many relevant clinical studies were completed and published, true RCTs and high quality trials are non-existent. Randomised double-blind controlled trials are urgently needed. It is important to design trials with placebo and no intervention as control interventions in acupuncture clinical trials.<BR/>Outcome measures that include cognition, behaviour, quality of life, activities of daily living and mood outcomes should be evaluated. Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardized monitoring and more attention should be paid to the possible long-term adverse effects of acupuncture.<BR/>
