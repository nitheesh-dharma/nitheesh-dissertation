<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Do inhaled corticosteroids administered to preterm infants with birth weight of up to 1500 grams beginning in the first two weeks after birth prevent chronic lung disease as reflected by the requirement for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Preterm babies who require breathing support often develop chronic lung disease. It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause. Corticosteroid drugs when given orally or through a vein reduce this inflammation. However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with serious side effects including cerebral palsy (motor problem) and developmental delay. It is possible that inhaling steroids, so that the drug directly reaches the lung, may reduce the adverse effects. This review looked at trials that compared preterm babies who received steroids or placebo (inactive drug) by inhalation while they were receiving breathing support. There was no previous evidence that the early administration of inhaled steroids reduces chronic lung disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>From literature searches updated to 5 January 2016, 10 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 1644 infants were included.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
<BR/>We are not aware of any financial support from the industry for the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>In this update of the review there was no significant reduction in the rate of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. A significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among all randomised neonates and among survivors was noted. Even though the results were significant, the upper confidence interval was infinity (i.e. we would have to treat every baby with inhaled steroid to prevent one baby dying or developing chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age). This would not be acceptable in clinical practice. A lower rate of reintubation (the need for the insertion of a tube into the airway) was noted in the steroid group compared with the control group in one large study. There were no statistically significant differences in short- and long-term complications between groups. The results of the long-term follow-up of one large study is awaited.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-06 14:54:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a common complication among preterm infants. There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CLD. Due to their strong anti-inflammatory properties, corticosteroids are an attractive intervention strategy. However, there are growing concerns regarding short- and long-term effects of systemic corticosteroids. Theoretically, administration of inhaled corticosteroids may allow for beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with a lower risk of undesirable systemic side effects.</P>

<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 5 January 2016), MEDLINE (1966 to 5 January 2016), Embase (1980 to 5 January 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 5 January 2016), reference lists of published trials and abstracts published in <I>Pediatric Research</I> or electronically on the Pediatric Academic Societies web-site (1990 to May 2016).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-12-13 08:56:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review randomised controlled trials of inhaled corticosteroid therapy initiated within the first two weeks of life in VLBW preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-13 09:43:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We evaluated data regarding clinical outcomes, including: CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks' PMA; mortality; combined outcome of death or CLD at 28 days of age and at 36 weeks' PMA; the need for systemic corticosteroids; failure to extubate within 14 days; and adverse effects of corticosteroids. All data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5. Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). If RD was significant, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was calculated. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 09:02:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to GRADE the quality of the studies was moderate. Three additional trials are included in this update. The present review includes data analyses based on 10 qualifying trials that enrolled 1644 neonates. There was no significant difference in the incidence of CLD at 36 weeks' PMA in the inhaled steroid versus the placebo group (5 trials, 429 neonates) among all randomised (typical RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.52; typical RD &#8722;0.00, 95% CI &#8722;0.07 to 0.06). There was no heterogeneity for this outcome (typical RR I² = 11%; typical RD I² = 0%). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of CLD at 36 weeks' PMA among survivors (6 trials, 1088 neonates) (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; typical RD &#8722;0.07, 95% CI &#8722;0.13 to &#8722;0.02; NNTB 14, 95% CI 8 to 50). There was a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA among all randomised neonates (6 trials, 1285 neonates) (typical RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; typical RD &#8722;0.06, 95% CI &#8722;0.11 to &#8722;0.00) (P = 0.04); NNTB 17, 95% CI 9 to infinity). There was no significant heterogeneity for any of these analyses (I² = 0%). A lower rate of reintubation was noted in the inhaled steroid group compared with the control group in one study. There were no statistically significant differences in short-term complications between groups and no differences in adverse events at long-term follow-up reported. Long-term follow-up of infants enrolled in the study by <A HREF="Bassler 2015">Bassler 2015</A> is ongoing.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 09:03:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this updated review, there is increasing evidence from the trials reviewed that early administration of inhaled steroids to VLBW neonates is effective in reducing the incidence of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA among either all randomised infants or among survivors. Even though there is statistical significance, the clinical relevance is of question as the upper CI limit for the outcome of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA is infinity. The long-term follow-up results of the <A HREF="Bassler 2015">Bassler 2015</A> study may affect the conclusions of this review. Further studies are needed to identify the risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of these medications. Studies need to address both the short- and long-term benefits and adverse effects of inhaled steroids with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-27 18:49:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-27 15:31:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-13 09:20:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a common complication among survivors of neonatal intensive care. Despite the use of antenatal corticosteroids and postnatal surfactant treatment, the incidence of CLD has increased. This is partly explained by increased survival of extremely low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1993</LINK>), in that the incidence of CLD has an inverse relationship with birth weight and gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Sinkin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinkin 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>O'Brodovich and Mellins have used the term "unresolved neonatal acute lung injury" to describe CLD (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1985</LINK>). According to their model, CLD results from disordered repair processes in a susceptible baby following acute lung injury induced by various pulmonary disorders and positive pressure ventilation. Preventive strategies can focus on any point in the cascade, including prevention or amelioration of the primary pulmonary disorders affecting preterm babies, reduction in ventilator-induced lung injury or modification of the response to tissue injury (<LINK REF="REF-Sinkin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinkin 1987</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-21 20:42:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1995</LINK>). In many infants, an inflammatory reaction is evident shortly after birth suggesting that the process may have been triggered in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 1996</LINK>). Therefore, interventions aimed at reducing or modulating the inflammatory process may reduce the incidence or severity of CLD.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-27 15:31:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment with corticosteroids is an attractive intervention strategy to achieve this goal due to their strong anti-inflammatory properties. Systematic reviews on the early use of postnatal systemic corticosteroids (&#8804; 7 days) and the late use of postnatal systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 7 days) have demonstrated a reduction in CLD at 28 days and 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK> concluded that the benefits of early and postnatal use of corticosteroids may not outweigh actual or potential adverse effects. There are concerns regarding the short- and long-term adverse effects of systemic corticosteroid therapy in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>). These include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, growth failure and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. The potential effects on brain growth and neurodevelopment are most alarming: studies in animals have shown that steroids can permanently affect brain cell division, differentiation and myelination, as well as the ontogeny of cerebral cortical development (<LINK REF="REF-Weichsel-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weichsel 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1979</LINK>). As both dexamethasone and hydrocortisone administration within the first seven days of life is associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy, early postnatal corticosteroid therapy is not recommended to prevent CLD. After seven days of life, dexamethasone has been shown to decrease the rate of CLD at 36 weeks&#8217; postmenstrual age with less impact on neurodevelopmental outcome. No trials have examined whether the benefits of corticosteroids outweigh the adverse effects for infants at high risk of, or with, severe CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferies-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferies 2012</LINK>). Follow-up of double-blind randomised controlled trials of dexamethasone, commenced within 12 hours of birth, showed a two-fold increase in neuromotor impairments in surviving dexamethasone-treated infants as compared with controls at two years' corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1999</LINK>). Two meta-regression meta-analyses have concluded that the effect of postnatal corticosteroids on the combined outcome of death or cerebral palsy varies with the level of risk for CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014c</LINK>). Theoretically, administration of corticosteroids topically may allow for beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with a lower risk of undesirable systemic side effects.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-27 15:31:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A variety of Cochrane reviews address the use of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention or treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or CLD.</P>
<P>These include reviews of the early use (&#8804; 7 days) of systemic postnatal corticosteroids to prevent chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>), as well as the late use (&gt; 7 days) of systemic postnatal corticosteroids for CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, a variety of reviews address the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention or treatment of CLD. Onland and colleagues have reviewed the late use (&#8805; 7 days) of inhaled corticosteroids to reduce BPD in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Onland-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onland 2012</LINK>). Shah and colleagues have compared the use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for preventing CLD in ventilated very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2003</LINK>); and the use of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of CLD in ventilated VLBW preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of corticosteroids for other indications in neonates including intravenous dexamethasone to facilitate extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>), corticosteroids for the treatment of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2011</LINK>), and corticosteroids for the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2003</LINK>) are reviewed.</P>
<P>This review aims to examine the impact of inhaled corticosteroid therapy when administered to VLBW preterm infants within the first two weeks of life for the prevention of CLD. This is an update of our review in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2007a</LINK>), and in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' PMA and death and CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst all randomised and amongst survivors.</P>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK>: the study by Bassler and co-workers enrolled 863 infants with postmenstrual age (PMA) 23<SUP>0/7</SUP> weeks to 27<SUP>6/7</SUP> weeks and chronological age of 12 hours or less, who required any form of positive pressure support. Exclusion criteria were: palliative care; dysmorphic feature or congenital abnormalities likely to affect life expectancy or neurologic development; strongly suspected cyanotic heart disease; and, to prevent a correlated data problem, the infant was from a multiple-birth pregnancy (other than the second infant in birth order, who was considered eligible). The budesonide group (n = 441; 437 followed to first discharge home) received two puffs of budesonide (200 µg/puff) administered every 12 hours for the first 14 days of life and one puff administered every 12 hours from day 15 until the last dose of study drug had been administered. Study drugs were administered until infants no longer needed supplemental oxygen and positive pressure support or reached a PMA of 32<SUP>0/7</SUP> weeks, regardless of ventilator status. The control group (n = 422; 419 followed to first discharge home) received two puffs of placebo containing only hydrofluoroalkane propellant.</P>
<P>Primary outcome: a composite of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' PMA. BPD was defined as the requirement for positive pressure support, the requirement for supplemental oxygen at FiO&#8322; exceeding 0.30, or in infants receiving low amounts of oxygen, an inability to maintain an oxygen saturation value above 90% during a structured, short period of saturation monitoring coupled with gradual weaning from oxygen to ambient air (oxygen reduction test).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes included: death by any cause at 36 weeks' PMA, BPD at 36 weeks' PMA (defined as per above); duration of positive pressure respiratory support or supplemental oxygen; ventriculomegaly with or without intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) on ultrasound at or before 36 weeks' PMA; patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring medical or surgical treatment; intestinal perforation or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 2 or higher); culture-proven infections; increase in body weight and head circumference from birth to day 28; length of hospital stay; need for reintubation after the last dose of drug had been administered; occurrence of oral candidiasis requiring treatment; hyperglycaemia requiring insulin treatment; and hypertension requiring treatment.</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental disability testing is to be conducted at 18 to 22 months (hence is not reported in this current publication).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1999</LINK>: the study by Cole and co-workers enrolled infants of less than 33 weeks gestational age (GA) and with birth weight equal up to 1250 grams who required assisted ventilation at three to 14 days of life. The infants were randomly assigned to receive inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (n = 123) or placebo (n = 130). The desired dose was calculated to deliver to the lung 40 µg/kg/day for the first week, 30 and 15 µg/kg/day for the second and third weeks respectively, and then 10 and 5 µg/kg/day during the fourth week. The primary outcome was the incidence of BPD in survivors defined as an abnormal chest x-ray and need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of BPD in survivors at 36 weeks' PMA (defined as an abnormal chest x-ray and need for supplemental oxygen at that age), duration of respiratory support (oxygen, mechanical ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure), the need for systemic glucocorticoids, diuretic or bronchodilator therapy, death, length of hospitalisation and the incidence of complications possibly attributable to the use of inhaled steroids. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy was permitted at the discretion of the infant's physician. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar except for maternal race or ethnic group (P = 0.03). Two additional reports from the same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1999</LINK>) have been published as separate articles. One of these reports evaluated the effect of inhaled beclomethasone therapy on adrenal response and the other report evaluated its effect on tracheal aspirate inflammatory mediators (IL-8 and IL-1ra).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK>: the study by Denjean and co-workers enrolled infants with respiratory distress syndrome and PMA less than 31 weeks. Infants were eligible for the study if they required ventilator support (intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) or nasal IMV/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> postnatal day. 178 infants were randomised, five were withdrawn leaving 173 infants in the trial who were assigned to four groups (placebo + placebo; placebo + salbutamol; placebo + beclomethasone; beclomethasone + salbutamol) of which two (placebo + placebo and placebo + beclomethasone) are included in our review. Beclomethasone (250 µg) was given four times a day (1000 µg daily). Treatment was started on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> or 11<SUP>th</SUP> postnatal day and was given for 28 days, with dose tapering over a period of eight days. Total number reported on: n = 43. Placebo (250 µg) was given four times a day (1000 µg daily). Treatment was started on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> or 11<SUP>th</SUP> postnatal day and was given for 28 days, with dose tapering over a period of 8 days. Total number reported on: n = 43. Beclomethasone and placebo were administered by metered-dose inhalers.</P>
<P>The main outcome criterion was CLD. The diagnosis of CLD was made at 28 days of age on the basis of clinical (oxygen dependence) and radiographic criteria. CLD was categorized in three grades of severity: severe: ventilation with endotracheal tube (ET) for more than three months or oxygen supplementation for more than four months; moderate: ventilation with ET for more than one month or oxygen supplementation for more than two months; and mild: ventilation with ET for less than one month and oxygen supplementation for less than two months. The definition of CLD was unclear. Secondary outcomes included: survival without CLD, death (during hospital stay), ventilatory support (nasal IMV, CPA or IMV) (days), need for supplementary oxygen (days), need for systemic dexamethasone (IV), and sepsis (positive blood culture).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fok 1999</LINK>: the study by Fok and co-workers enrolled 53 infants born at less than 32 weeks' GA, birth weight less than 1.5 kg, requiring mechanical ventilation with an arterial PO&#8322;/alveolar PO&#8322; ratio of less than 0.25 at 6 to 10 hours after the second dose of surfactant was administered. Infants were excluded if they needed high-frequency ventilation at the time of enrolment. Infants were randomised to receive inhaled fluticasone propionate or placebo. Two puffs of fluticasone propionate (250 micrograms/puff) or placebo were administered 12 hourly for two weeks. The first dose was administered within 24 hours of birth. The primary outcome was successful extubation by day seven or day 14 of life. Secondary outcomes included mortality, oxygen dependency at 28 days of postnatal age and at 36 weeks' PMA. The incidence of complications possibly attributable to the use of inhaled steroids was monitored. Twenty-seven infants were enrolled in the fluticasone propionate group and 26 in the placebo group. The two groups were similar in their demographic and perinatal characteristics.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jangaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jangaard 2002</LINK>: the study by Jangaard and co-workers enrolled 60 preterm infants weighing less than 1250 grams with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and requiring ventilatory support at 72 hours of age. Infants were randomly assigned to receive inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (250 µg/puff) or placebo for four weeks. Medication dosage assumed a 10% deposition of the administered dose with the aim to provide a total dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day. When the infants were extubated, the study drug was administered using an infant-sized Aerochamber (Boehringer Ingelheim, Canada) with an appropriately fitted mask. The primary outcome for this study was BPD defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. <LINK REF="STD-Jangaard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jangaard 2002</LINK> has been previously published in abstract form.

Inclusion criteria were 1) mechanical ventilation on day six of life, or 2) if extubated, nasal continuous positive airway pressure with FiO&#8322; of 0.3 or higher. Infants with the following conditions were excluded: congenital malformations, congenital heart disease and grades III-IV IVH. Infants on high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) were excluded as the inhalations could not be given through the electronic dosimetric jet nebulizer. Infants were randomised to receive 500 µg twice a day or placebo delivered using a dosimetric jet nebulizer with variable inspiratory time and breath sensitivity. Inhalations were started on day seven of life. The primary objective was to attain a 30% reduction in FiO&#8322; levels in the budesonide treatment group after 14 days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included: duration of supplemental oxygen, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of nasal CPAP, oxygen requirements at 28 days of age and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Adrenal cortisol response to stimulation was measured at baseline (prior to commencement of inhalation) and at the end of the study period. Information on adverse events &#8212; hyperglycaemia, hypertension, sepsis, PDA, IVH and gastrointestinal problems &#8212; were collected. Of the 30 infants enrolled, one parent declined to participate and two eligible infants could not be included due to ongoing HFOV on day seven of life. Thirteen infants were enrolled in the budesonide group, of which eight were ventilated, while 14 infants were enrolled in the placebo group, of which nine were ventilated at the commencement of therapy. Only one outcome for ventilated infants was reported (successful extubation during the study period &#8210; 14 days).</P>

Infants were randomly assigned to inhaled budesonide (200 µg/puff) or placebo. Two puffs were administered four times a day for a total of 10 days. The primary outcome was duration of artificial ventilation. Secondary outcomes included the duration of supplemental oxygen and the release of albumin and different inflammatory mediators in the tracheobronchial aspirate fluid. Adverse events such as frequency of acute infections, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and adrenal suppression were evaluated.

Infants were randomised to prophylactic inhaled steroids starting within 24 hours of birth and continuing until six weeks of age or extubation. Two doses of 50 µg fluticasone propionate (FP) were administered every 24 hours. The placebo group received two doses of placebo every 24 hours. The placebo contained only hydrofluoroalkane propellant. The primary outcome was death or oxygen dependency at discharge from NICU. Secondary outcomes included death, severe BPD and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months' PMA and three years of age.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 13:52:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review update identified one additional published trial that previously was listed as an ongoing trial in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK>); and one new trial from Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2016</LINK>). Both trials were of high GRADE quality, but <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2016</LINK> reported all outcomes as a combination of death and a complication of preterm birth. We therefore could not include the results in meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK> was moved from excluded to included trials. The study lacks information on most items in the 'Risk of bias' assessment. The review now includes information from 10 trials which have enrolled 1644 infants.</P>
<P>There is now evidence that inhaled steroids are effective in reducing the incidence of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA among all randomised infants. There was a significant difference noted for the combined outcome of death by, or CLD at, 36 weeks' PMA (typical RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; typical RD &#8722;0.06, 95% CI &#8722;0.11 to &#8722;0.00 (P = 0.04); NNTB 17, 95% CI 9 to infinity). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 0%; RD I² = 0%). In addition there is evidence that inhaled steroids reduce the risk of need for reintubation. Even though there is evidence, the concern is whether this benefit is of any clinical relevance. The NNTB to prevent one infant from developing death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA is 17 with the upper 95% CI of infinity and therefore not clinically important. Based on this result the use of inhaled steroids in this population cannot be recommended. The long-term follow-up results of <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK> may affect the conclusion of this review.</P>
<P>Among survivors, inhaled steroids are effective in reducing the incidence of CLD at 36 weeks' PMA (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; typical RD &#8722;0.07, 95% CI &#8722;0.13 to &#8722;0.02 (P = 0.005); NNTB 14, 95% CI 8 to 15). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 0%; RD I² = 0%). In one trial enrolling 56 neonates, no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral palsy was noted.</P>
<P>A major concern with studies of inhalation therapy in neonates is the uncertainty regarding drug delivery and deposition in the peripheral airways. Numerous factors affect drug delivery and deposition including the number of particles in the respirable range, the delivery technique (use of MDI in combination with a spacer or face mask and nebuliser (ultrasonic or jet)) and the presence or absence of an endotracheal tube. Previous workers have shown that the amount of aerosol delivery varies from 0.4% to 14% based on the technique used (<LINK REF="REF-Arnon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 1992</LINK>). Delivery technique, type of inhaled steroid and dosage used varied among the studies included in this review, making the interpretation of aggregate data difficult.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is now some evidence from this systematic review that inhaled steroids reduce the incidence of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst all randomised but the evidence is not of clinical relevance.</P>
<P>Studies are needed to examine the effect of different delivery techniques and dosing schedules for the administration of these medications. It is possible that, with improved and/or more consistent delivery of inhaled steroids to the target organ, an important therapeutic effect will be demonstrated. Long-term outcomes are awaited from the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK>.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 13:53:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By 2016 a total of 1644 infants have been enrolled in trials testing the effectiveness of early administration of inhaled steroids. There is now moderate GRADE evidence that early administration of inhaled steroids reduces the incidence of death or CLD at 36 weeks' PMA among all randomised infants and among survivors only, but the significance is not clinically relevant. In addition there is evidence that inhaled steroids reduces the risk of need for reintubation.</P>

<P>According to GRADE the quality of evidence was moderate for the outcomes of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' PMA and death and CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst all randomised and amongst survivors. There was serious risk of bias, with method of sequence generation being unclear in all included studies except for <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK>.

<P>Of the included studies in this review, only the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK> showed a reduction in CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst survivors. No difference was noted for the outcome of CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst all randomised infants. The inclusion of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK> for the combined outcome of death and CLD at 36 weeks' PMA amongst all randomised was significant; however the CI is close to 1 and of questionable clinical relevance. In a systematic review published by Beam and colleagues the authors concluded that inhaled steroids were ineffective in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Beam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beam 2014</LINK>). This review was completed before the publication by <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK>. In an editorial regarding the <LINK REF="STD-Bassler-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bassler 2015</LINK> study Schmidt concluded that "Uncertainty prevails with respect to the use of early inhaled glucocorticosteroids to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2015</LINK>). In contrast in an editorial to the excluded study by <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 2016</LINK>, Bancalari and Jobe concluded: "If the striking pulmonary benefits with absent detrimental effects described by Yeh and colleagues are replicated in large randomised controlled trials done in different clinical setting, this could very well become a 'magic bullet' in the prevention of BPD" (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 2016</LINK>). We excluded the study by <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 2016</LINK>, as the intervention was a combination of intratracheal steroids and surfactant.</P>

<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the 'Risk of bias' table:<BR/>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>b. high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;<BR/>b. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;<BR/>c. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b. high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6.Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a. low risk;<BR/>b. high risk;<BR/>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<BR/>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
