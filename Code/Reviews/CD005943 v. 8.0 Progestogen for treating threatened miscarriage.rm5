<P>With the addition of the data from the new included studies, meta-analysis suggested that oral progestogen is effective in treating threatened miscarriage. Data analysis also suggested that treatment of women with threatened miscarriage by progestogens did not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities, pregnancy induced hypertension nor antepartum haemorrhage. However these results should be approached with caution due to the small sample size and the poor methodological quality of the included studies. </P>

<TITLE>Progestogen for treating threatened miscarriage</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-06 08:54:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Miscarriage occurs in about 15% to 20% of pregnancies. Threatened miscarriage is when a mother might be losing her baby at less than 20 weeks' gestation. The signs are vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal pain, while the cervix is closed. The use of ultrasound scans in the management of bleeding in early pregnancy has improved the diagnosis and management, as attempts to maintain a pregnancy are likely to be effective only if the fetus is viable and has no chromosomal abnormalities. Once the cervix begins to open, pregnancy loss is inevitable. The loss can cause emotional problems including depression, sleep disturbances, and anger. Women who continue with their pregnancy after threatened miscarriage were found to have increased risk of antepartum haemorrhage, pre-labour rupture of the membranes, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. Progestogen is an essential hormone both for establishing and maintaining pregnancy. It is therefore a possible treatment for threatened miscarriage. The review of trials located four randomised studies involving 421 women that compared the use of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage with either placebo or no treatment. The limited evidence suggests that the use of a progestogen does reduce the rate of spontaneous miscarriage. Two trials reported that treatment with progestogens did not increase the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in the newborns and the women did not have any significant difference in incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension nor antepartum haemorrhage. Further larger studies are warranted for firmer conclusions.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-10-14 15:37:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. The role of progesterone in preparing the uterus for the implantation of the embryo and its role in maintaining the pregnancy have been known for a long time. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-04 22:07:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We included four studies (421 participants) in the meta-analysis. In three studies all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the fourth study, we included only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria in the meta-analysis. There was evidence of a reduction in the rate of spontaneous miscarriage with the use of progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.79). There was no increase in the rate of antepartum haemorrhage (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.94), or pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.88) for the mother. The rate of congenital abnormalities was no different between the newborns of the mothers who received progestogens and those who did not (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.10 to 4.82).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-04 22:07:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The data from this review suggest that the use of progestogens is effective in the treatment of threatened miscarriage with no evidence of increased rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension or antepartum haemorrhage as harmful effects to the mother, nor increased occurrence of congenital abnormalities on the newborn. However, the analysis was limited by the small number and the poor methodological quality of eligible studies (four studies) and the small number of the participants (421), which limit the power of the meta-analysis and hence of this conclusion.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-06 09:06:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>"Miscarriage is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks' gestation based on the first day of the last menstrual period or, if gestation age is unknown, it is the loss of an embryo or a fetus of less than 400 g" (<LINK REF="REF-Zegers_x002d_Hochschild-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zegers-Hochschild 2009</LINK>). Threatened miscarriage is manifested by vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal pain, while the cervix is closed and the fetus is viable and inside the uterine cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001a</LINK>). Once the cervix begins to dilate, miscarriage and pregnancy loss are inevitable. When the fetus is non-viable and the cervix is closed, this is known as missed miscarriage or missed abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001a</LINK>). The presence of a short cervix or funnelling of the internal cervical os in the gestation period between 16 and 24 weeks has been found to indicate an increase risk or a threat to miscarry (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rust-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy occurring in 15% to 20% of all clinically recognised pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Blohm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blohm 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbert--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2009</LINK>). It is associated with chromosomal abnormality of the conceptus in over 50% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Suzumori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzumori 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vorsanova-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorsanova 2005</LINK>). Other risk factors for miscarriage include maternal age over 34 and paternal age over 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-De-La-Rochebrochard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De La Rochebrochard 2002</LINK>), maternal obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Metwally--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metwally 2008</LINK>) maternal infection such as genital herpes simplex, human immunodeficiency virus-1 and vaginal colonisation of group B streptococci (<LINK REF="REF-Nigro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nigro 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocchetti-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocchetti 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temmerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temmerman 1992</LINK>). Maternal endocrine abnormalities such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Khaskheli--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaskheli 2010</LINK>) and insufficient production of progesterone by the corpus luteum, polycystic ovary syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Arredondo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arredondo 2006</LINK>), maternal autoimmune factors such as phospholipids antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Check-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Check 2011</LINK>), and a previous history of two or more miscarriages (<LINK REF="REF-Sugiura_x002d_Ogasawara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugiura-Ogasawara 2009</LINK>) are other suggested factors associated with miscarriage. In many cases, the cause of miscarriage cannot be identified.</P>
<P>Miscarriage is associated with considerable physical and psychological morbidity. Women who had threatened miscarriage were found to have increased rate of antepartum haemorrhage, pre-labour rupture of the membranes, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction when compared with women who did not have threatened miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Saraswat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saraswat 2010</LINK>). The emotional response to miscarriage can be profound; it includes depression, sleep disturbance, anger, and marital disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Marcinko-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcinko 2011</LINK>). The introduction of ultrasound scans in the management of bleeding in early pregnancy has improved the diagnosis by rapid confirmation of viability and has improved the management by introducing prognostic factors such as fetal bradycardia and discrepancy between gestational age and crown-to-rump length (<LINK REF="REF-Dede-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dede 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makrydimas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrydimas 2003</LINK>). This has rationalised the management as attempts to maintain a pregnancy are likely to be effective only if the fetus is viable and has no chromosomal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Progestogens are a group of hormones, which bind to the progesterone receptors; they include both the natural female sex hormone progesterone and the synthetic forms. Progesterone is secreted during early pregnancy from the ovary by corpus luteum (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001b</LINK>). It is an essential hormone for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy by inducing secretary changes in the lining of the uterus, which are important for implantation of the fertilised ovum (<LINK REF="REF-Jin--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2006</LINK>). Progesterone modulates the immune response of the mother to prevent rejection of the embryo and it enhances uterine quiescence and suppresses uterine contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Szekeres_x002d_Bartho-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szekeres-Bartho 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szekeres_x002d_Bartho-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szekeres-Bartho 2009</LINK>). Low progesterone levels have been linked to increased risk of first trimester miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Osmana_x011f_ao_x011f_lu--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmana&#287;ao&#287;lu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Owing to the documented physiological role of progesterone in maintaining pregnancy, it has been used to treat women with threatened miscarriage and presumed progesterone deficiency to improve expectations for continuity of pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK>). The therapeutic value of progesterone in preventing or treating threatened miscarriage has not been established (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalinka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalinka 2005</LINK>). This might be due to the poor designs of the studies done to evaluate its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Kalinka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalinka 2005</LINK>), and the inclusion of women in these trials with different etiologies for threatened miscarriage.</P>
<P>The importance of progesterone on the maintenance of pregnancy was demonstrated by the successful use of progesterone antagonists, such as mifepristone (RU 486) in the elective induction of abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2003</LINK>). In a recently published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2008</LINK>), intramuscular progesterone was associated with a reduction in the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation, and infant birthweight less than 2500 g. This raised the question about the importance of the route of administration and the type of progestogen used to prevent preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Renzo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Renzo 2005</LINK>). These same questions might apply to the use of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage.</P>
<P>In earlier reports progestogen therapy has been linked to the development of hypospadias (deformity of the penis) in the male fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1999</LINK>); however, recent reports did not show an increase in rate of hypospadias in infants of mothers who received progestogens in early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_ll_x00e9_n-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Källén 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to study all the available data on the effectiveness of administration of progestogens for the treatment of threatened miscarriage.</P>

<P>We have included four trials (involving 421 participants).</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2009</LINK>, 146 women who presented in the first trimester of pregnancy, with mild to moderate vaginal bleeding were randomised according to the day of the week they were seen and enrolled in the trial. All participants had ultrasound examination to confirm viability of pregnancy. Eighty-six women received oral dydrogesterone 10 mg twice a day and 60 women received no medication and were considered as control. The treatment started as soon as the participant was enrolled in the trial and continued for one week after bleeding had stopped. Treatment was considered successful if at the follow-up ultrasound scan confirmed viability of the fetus one week after bleeding stopped. Ninety-five per cent of the participants were enrolled in the trial between the fifth and eighth week of pregnancy.The main outcomes of this trial were the effect of dydrogesterone on the frequency of miscarriage, preterm labour, and congenital abnormalities of the newborn as compared to the control group. Secondry outcomes included pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and antepartum haemorrhage. For all secondary outcomes all participants who had miscarriage (intervention and control) were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gerhard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhard 1987</LINK>, 64 women were randomised; eight women were excluded and the remaining 56 women were analysed. We included only a subgroup of 34 women in this review as they fulfilled the inclusion criteria of confirmation of fetal viability by ultrasound scan before commencement of treatment. The women were accepted to the trial in the first trimester of pregnancy and were randomised to treatment and placebo groups. The treatment group received 25 mg progesterone twice daily in the form of vaginal suppositories and the control group received a placebo. The intervention continued until the woman either miscarried or for 14 days after the bleeding stopped. The main outcomes of this study included miscarriage, birthweight, and preterm labour. The subgroup of the 34 women from this study were analysed for the primary outcome as for the secondary outcomes such as preterm birth; data could not be extracted separately.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK> evaluated 50 women with previous diagnosis of inadequate luteal phase, a current diagnosis of threatened miscarriage and confirmed fetal viability. Gestational age at the time of enrolment to the study was six to 12 weeks. The treatment group received 90 mg progesterone (Crinone<SUP>®</SUP> 8%) vaginal gel once daily and the control group received a placebo. The assessment of the pain was by a five-point scale. The duration of the intervention lasted five days. The women were followed for up to 60 days for the occurrence of miscarriage and for five days for the other outcomes, which were pain relief, frequency of uterine contractions and blood loss. The effect of progesterone on miscarriage rate was analysed as a primary outcome while its effect on pain relief could not be analysed because data were skewed.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Pandian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pandian 2009</LINK>, a total of 191 women, between five and 16 weeks pregnant, were enrolled; 96 women were randomised to receiving dydrogesterone and 95 were randomised to receiving no treatment and considered as the control group. The intervention group received an initial 40 mg oral dydrogesterone followed by 10 mg dydrogesterone twice daily, treatment continued until 16 weeks' gestation and was considered to be successful if pregnancy continued beyond 20 weeks' gestation. The outcomes of this trial included: miscarriage, preterm labour, congenital anomalies, antepartum haemorrhage, placenta previa, cesarean section rate, pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-06 09:08:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Progestogens have been investigated by many studies for more than half a century as therapeutic agents for the treatment of miscarriage, but the poor methodological quality of these studies and the inclusion in the investigated population of women with undocumented fetal viability have resulted in uncertainties associated with the use of this hormone and its effect on miscarriage. To properly assess the effects of progestogens on threatened miscarriage, it is important to avoid the inclusion, in the analyses, of women with similar clinical presentation but different underlying conditions such as those with viable and non-viable (missed miscarriage) pregnancies. We therefore specified the viability of the fetus, as confirmed by a reliable method, as an inclusion criterion for studies in this review.</P>
<P>The results of the meta-analysis of this review indicated that progestogen treatment for threatened miscarriage reduced the risk of miscarriage by 47% with a confidence interval consistent with a risk reduction of 21% to 65%. Only in a subgroup of women who were treated with vaginal progesterone was the treatment not statistically effective in reducing miscarriage; however, the point estimate for the risk ratio for this subgroup favours progesterone with moderate reduction on miscarriage in the treated group remains possible.</P>
<P>Although progestational agents were found to have some positive effect in the treatment and prevention of threatened preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010 </LINK>), there was no statistically significant difference, in our meta-analysis, between the number of preterm labours in the progestogen and control groups. However, it is important to note that this systematic review only assesses progestogen given in early pregnancy to treat miscarriage, rather than to assess progestogen given in the second or third trimester to prevent or treat preterm labour.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the number of congenital abnormalities, pregnancy-induced hypertension nor antepartum haemorrhage between the women who received progestogens and those who did not.</P>
<P>One of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK>) has investigated the effect of progesterone on the relief of pain due to threatened miscarriage in a five-point scale 0-4 where 0 indicated no pain and 4 indicated extreme pain, and has shown significant reduction in the mean pain score with the use of progesterone, with no significant reduction in the pain score in the placebo group. We were unable to analyse these data further, as they were skewed.</P>
<P>The results of this systematic review should be approached with caution due the poor methodological quality of some of the included trials and the small number the participants.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of some studies included in this review was unclear in some respects, such as the methods of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Gerhard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK>) and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Gerhard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhard 1987</LINK>), and were inadequate in others such as the randomisation and the allocation concealment in <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2009</LINK>, which made the presence of selection bias a possibility we could not refute or confirm. The lack of blinding of the participants and the study personnel in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pandian 2009</LINK>) increased the possibility of a performance bias in these studies.</P>
<P>Whilst attrition bias was not detected in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pandian 2009</LINK>), we graded the <LINK REF="STD-Gerhard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhard 1987</LINK> study as 'unclear' risk of bias in relation to attrition bias but it was not possible to grade the <LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK> study because the number of participants who dropped out was not specified, with the additional weakness that it was unclear where the replacements came from. Intention-to-treat analysis was not observed in either of the above trials and we were unable to perform that due to the lack of necessary data; however, we could perform intention-to-treat analysis in <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2009</LINK> as data were available. All these potential and confirmed biases affect the validity of the trials and put them in the methodologically-poor category.</P>
<P>Some possible long- and short-term adverse outcomes of the mother and the newborn were not addressed by the included studies, such as a possible association between progestogen use and development of hypospadias; such association was noticed in children conceived through in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for mothers who received progestogens in early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1999</LINK>). Such an increase in the incidence of hypospadias in this cohort may be accounted for by the general documented increase in the incidence of all congenital malformations in children conceived by IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 2005</LINK>); especially that other population-based studies have not demonstrated this association (<LINK REF="REF-Dudas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Threatened miscarriage is a common health problem, and miscarriage can cause serious morbidity among childbearing women. Any treatment which might prove to be effective is worth investigation. </P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2011-06-17 12:34:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Methods used when assessing trials included in previous versions of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-22 16:20:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Gerhard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palagiano-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palagiano 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>We included trials that met the inclusion criteria detailed above. Two review authors assessed the trials for inclusion independently and any disagreement was resolved by discussion between all the review authors. Both review authors independently reviewed the full text of the identified articles, including those where there was disagreement in the initial title or abstract scanning, to ensure that the inclusion criteria were met. Where necessary, we contacted the author for additional information.</P>
<P>One review author identified articles from other sources (experts or reference lists) as possibly eligible and two authors then assessed them for inclusion independently as described above. Authors were not blinded to the journal of origin or institution. Two authors independently assessed the abstracts of non-English articles, which had been translated, to ascertain if they met the inclusion criteria. We obtained a translation of the full article for those that met the criteria except for one article which is pending evaluation.</P>
<P>We assessed the validity of each included trial according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). These included:</P>
<P>(1) Assessment of generation of randomization sequence and allocation concealment (selection bias). This was graded as:<BR/>(A) adequate such as telephone randomization;<BR/>(B) uncertain when the study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate such as use of dates of birth or days of the week.<BR/>Where the method of allocation concealment is unclear, attempts were made to contact authors to provide further details.</P>
<P>(2) We assessed blinding, (performance bias) using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
<P>(3) We assessed completeness to follow up (attrition bias) using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) more than 10% and less than 20% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.<BR/>We excluded from the analysis data for the outcomes where more than 20% of participants were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>(4) Analysis by intention to treat.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. At least two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter the data.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details. Statistical analysis was done using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>. Results were presented as relative risk, risk difference and number needed to treat.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data as trials were sufficiently similar.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the weighted mean difference (only one study analysed).</P>
<P>The same method of analysis will be used in future updates of this review if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials, and we will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. If there is evidence of skewness, this will be reported.</P>
<P>We were unable to perform an intention-to-treat analysis in this review because of insufficient information from the original trials but for future updates of this review, we will analyze data on an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, all participants with available data will be included in the analysis in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If, in the original reports, participants are not analysed in the group to which they were randomized, and there is sufficient information in the trial report, we will attempt to restore them to the correct group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomized trials. For future updates of this review, we will include cluster-randomized trials in the analyses. Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if the sources of heterogeneity are relatively small and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomization unit and perform a separate meta-analysis; therefore, the meta-analysis will be performed in two parts as well.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We did not need to assess heterogeneity in this review. For future updates of this review, we will apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. If we identify high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we will explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis and perform a sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis will be used as an overall summary if this is considered appropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies of similar quality were included in this meta-analysis. For future updates of this review, we will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality. This will involve analysis based on an A, B, C or D rating of selection bias, performance bias and attrition bias. The results of high-quality studies will be compared with those of poorer quality studies, where studies rated A for all quality criteria will be compared with those rated B, C or D.</P>
<P>We will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment (rated C).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Information from primary studies was not sufficient to perform subgroup analysis. For future updates of this review, should sufficient data become available, subgroup analysis will be done by type of progestogen, dose, and route of administration and effect of progestogens in early (no more than 12 weeks) and late (more than 12 weeks) threatened miscarriage.</P>
