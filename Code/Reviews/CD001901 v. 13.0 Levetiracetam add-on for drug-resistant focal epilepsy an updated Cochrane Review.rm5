<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 22:39:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Levetiracetam is one of a new cohort of antiepileptic drugs currently available. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding its effectiveness when used as an add-on treatment to usual care in people suffering from epilepsy that consists of drug-resistant focal seizures. At every dose that we analysed, levetiracetam significantly reduced the frequency of seizures as compared to placebo. However, because the size of that positive effect varies somewhat from trial to trial, it is difficult of us to provide a summary estimate of just how large or small an effect levetiracetam will have overall. At a dose of 2000 mg, levetiracetam was roughly four times more effective than placebo and approximately 30% of adults may be expected to have significant reduction in the frequency of their seizures. Children took 60 mg/kg/day of levetiracetam and this was roughly once more effective than placebo. Approximately a quarter of children may have significant reduction in seizures at this dose. The overall finding was that levetiracetam can be effective at reducing focal seizure frequency and it can also be well tolerated in both adults and children. A possibility of changes in behaviour in children on levetiracetam was highlighted and this finding requires validation. This review is an update to a review published in 2001 and we have found seven additional trials to those in the original review. The conclusions are largely unchanged between the two reviews. The most significant contribution of this update is the inclusion of data from children. The results are not relevant to the use of levetiracetam in generalised seizures or to its use as a single agent.</P>

<P>Epilepsy is an important neurological condition and drug resistance in epilepsy is particularly common in individuals with focal seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as add-on treatment for controlling drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update to a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2001.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response); less than 50% reduction in focal seizure frequency (non-response); treatment withdrawal; adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour); cognitive effects and quality of life (QoL). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of effect (99% CIs for adverse effects). Primary analyses were Intention-to-Treat (ITT). Dose response and inter-trial heterogeneity were evaluated in regression models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-06 22:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven trials (1861 participants) were included. They predominantly possessed low risks of bias. Participants were adults in nine trials (1565 participants) and children in the remaining two trials (296 participants). The dose of levetiracetam tested was 1000 to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. For the 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency outcome, the RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam at all doses. The naive estimates, ignoring dose, showed children (52% responded) as better responders than adults (39% responded) on levetiracetam. 25% of children and 16% of adults responded to placebo. The Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial outcome for children and adults was four (95% CI three to seven) and five (95% CI four to six), respectively. The significant levels of statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults precluded valid provision of an overall RR (ignoring dose). Results for the two trials that tested levetiracetam 2000 mg on adults were sufficiently similar to be combined to give an RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency of 4.91 (95% CI 2.75 to 8.77), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) for non-response. At this dose, 37% and 8% of adults were responders in the levetiracetam and placebo groups, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated that much of the heterogeneity between adult trials was likely to be explained by different doses of levetiracetam tested and different years of trial publication. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials on children. For these trials, the RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency was 1.91 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.63), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.81) for non-response. 27% of children responded. Participants were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.32 and RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46 for adults and children, respectively). For adults, somnolence (RR 1.51; 99% CI 1.06 to 2.17) and infection (RR 1.76; 99% CI 1.03 to 3.02) were significantly associated with levetiracetam. Accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo (RR 0.60; 99% CI 0.39 to 0.92). No individual adverse effect was significantly associated with levetiracetam in children. Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79; 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41) but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90; 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Cognitive effect and QoL outcomes suggested that levetiracetam had a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of QoL in adults. In children, levetiracetam did not appear to alter cognitive function but there was evidence of worsening in certain aspects of child behaviour. The overall quality of evidence used was high.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-06 22:32:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update adds seven more trials to the original review, which contained four trials. At every dose analysed, levetiracetam significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo. This indicates that levetiracetam can significantly reduce focal seizure frequency when it is used as an add-on treatment for both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. As there was evidence of significant levels of statistical heterogeneity within this positive effect it is difficult to be precise about the relative magnitude of the effect. At a dose of 2000 mg, levetiracetam may be expected to be 3.9 times more effective than placebo; with 30% of adults being responders at this dose. At a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, levetiracetam may be expected to be 0.9 times more effective than placebo; with 25% of children being responders at this dose. When dose was ignored, children were better responders than adults by around 4% to 13%. The results grossly suggest that one child or adult may respond to levetiracetam for every four or five children or adults, respectively, that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo. The drug seems to be well tolerated in both adults and children although non-specific changes in behaviour may be experienced in as high as 20% of children. This aspect of the adverse-effect profile of levetiracetam was analysed crudely and requires further investigation and validation. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The results cannot be used to confirm longer-term or monotherapy effects of levetiracetam or its effects on generalised seizures. The conclusions are largely unchanged from those in the original review. The most significant contribution of this update is the addition of paediatric data into the analysis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-07 23:06:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-06 22:46:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common and serious neurological condition, affecting between 260,000 and 416,000 people in England and Wales, and 1% to 2% of the global population across all ages (<LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In the developed world, the annual incidence of epilepsy is between 24 per 100,000 and 56 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 2005</LINK>), and its prevalence is from five per 1000 to 10 per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>). In the developing world, the incidence and prevalence estimates rise up to 158/100,000 and 74/1000, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Burneo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burneo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preux-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preux 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mac-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mac 2007</LINK>). This increase among developing countries may not only be because of poorer standards of health care, but also a higher proportion of children among these populations (<LINK REF="REF-Shorvon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorvon 1996</LINK>). The incidence of epilepsy peaks in early childhood before falling to low levels in early adult life and then rising again among elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Shorvon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorvon 1996</LINK>). The UK National General Practice Study of Epilepsy found that of the 60% of people with epilepsy who have convulsive seizures, focal epilepsy is more common than general epilepsy, affecting two-thirds and one third of the people, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The goal of epilepsy treatment is to achieve sustained seizure freedom and to achieve this using a tolerated antiepileptic drug (AED) schedule. Various combinations of older and newer AEDs can be used to try and achieve this, with varying success rates. The prognosis in newly diagnosed epilepsy can be favourable, with up to 50% of patients entering remission (seizure-freedom for five years on or off treatment) either without treatment or on their first AED (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maguire-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 2011</LINK>). An additional 10% achieve remission on a second or third drug (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2010</LINK>). For the remainder, AEDs may fail to provide remission from seizures. Pharmacoresistance or intolerable treatment-emergent adverse effects, or both, are major contributors to this.</P>
<P>When describing epilepsy, the term 'drug-resistant' is set to identify patients for whom there is sufficient information to predict that they will have a substantially poorer prognosis for seizure remission with AEDs when compared with the population as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>). It does not mean that there is no chance at all of remission, which is never the case (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>). For this reason, the term 'drug-resistant' is now preferred to terms such as 'refractory' or 'intractable' by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>). From a research point of view, a unifying definition of 'drug-resistant' epilepsy is yet to be agreed upon (<LINK REF="REF-French-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2006</LINK>). Diverse criteria or even a lack of explicit criteria have previously been employed by different groups to describe drug-resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>). In clinical trials set to involve patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, the criterion of inclusion is usually failure to achieve seizure freedom (for a set time period) on one to three AEDs. The ILAE have proposed a consensus definition of drug-resistant epilepsy as that for which there has been "failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom" (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2010</LINK>). This definition identifies that adults and children rarely achieve sustained seizure freedom once two agents have failed to control seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Krauss-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krauss 2011</LINK>). No seizure frequency requirement is necessary to meet this ILAE definition. This allows for those patients with infrequent seizures (e.g. occurring once a year) to still be regarded as drug-resistant, which is relevant to the impact seizures have on lifestyle factors such as driving.</P>
<P>Drug resistance is particularly prevalent among patients with focal seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>). According to revised ILAE classifications, focal seizures can be divided into: i) those without impairment of consciousness or awareness, ii) those with impairment of consciousness or awareness, and (within i or ii) iii) those evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure (involving tonic, clonic, or tonic and clonic components). This term 'focal' is now preferred to 'partial' when describing seizures, and i and ii (above) are now preferred to using the terms 'simple' and 'complex' when describing focal seizures, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>). The term 'secondary generalised' is replaced by (iii) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-07 23:06:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 2000s there has been the introduction of around 13 new AEDs globally, commonly termed second-generation AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2010</LINK>). In general, these newer drugs have been better tolerated by patients than the standard AEDs, such as carbamazepine, valproate, and phenytoin (<LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>). They have shown good clinical efficacy individually, and they are largely regarded as non-inferior to the standard AEDs; although there is very little in the way of direct head-to-head comparisons between standard and newer AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-French-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2004</LINK>). Levetiracetam [(<I>S</I>)-&#945;-ethyl-2-<I>oxo</I>-1-pyrrolidine acetamide] is one of the new AEDs, and is the subject of this review.</P>
<P>Levetiracetam was first introduced onto the market in April 2000, and is now marketed in over 50 countries (<LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>). It has been available as a generic brand in the US since 2008 and in the UK since 2011. Levetiracetam monotherapy has been shown to provide effective seizure control in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy consisting of focal seizures or generalised seizures. The effect was found to be non-inferior to carbamazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2007</LINK>). Intravenous (IV) levetiracetam has been tried in the treatment of status epilepticus in several open case series with reports of success in as high as 70% of cases (707 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Trinka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinka 2011</LINK>). Indications for levetiracetam as add-on treatment include focal seizures with or without evolution to bilateral convulsive seizures in adults and in children (from one month of age); primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and in children aged six years and above with idiopathic generalised epilepsy; and myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>). Independent systematic reviews of levetiracetam use for each of these indications are ongoing and will continue to form an important part of the evidence base behind use of this second-generation AED.</P>
<P>Levetiracetam can be administered orally as a tablet (either an immediate or extended-release preparation), as an oral solution, or as an IV concentrate for infusion. Based on current evidence, it is started at an effective dose of 1000 mg/day in adults and up-titrated in increments of 1000 mg/day every two weeks to a maximum dose of 3000 mg/day, depending on clinical response (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>). In children, dose is up-titrated to 60 mg/kg/day.</P>
<P>Levetiracetam possesses both antiepileptic and anti-epileptogenic properties (<LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>). Its exact mode of action is not completely understood (<LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>). It binds to, and modulates, the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A); a protein that has some controlling effect on neurotransmitter release from presynaptic vesicles (<LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillard 2006</LINK>). It also selectively inhibits N-type Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> channels and decreases intracellular calcium-ion increase (both of which negatively impact neurotransmitter release) (<LINK REF="REF-Niespodziany-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niespodziany 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lukyanetz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lukyanetz 2002</LINK>). There is evidence that it releases &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity and glycine-gated currents by acting on their negative allosteric modulators, namely zinc and the beta-carbolines (<LINK REF="REF-Rigo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigo 2002</LINK>). Neuroprotective effects have also been described (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 2006</LINK>). The proposed mechanisms of action of levetiracetam have been largely derived from animal-model studies, and the results remain to be validated in humans.</P>
<P>With regard to pharmacokinetics, levetiracetam generally demonstrates a favourable profile. Bioavailability is the fraction of a drug's administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation. When a drug is administered orally, bioavailability can be reduced by factors such as the rates of absorption and first-pass gut and hepatic metabolism. Oral levetiracetam provides close to 100% bioavailability, making it largely bioequivalent to IV levetiracetam (<LINK REF="REF-Trinka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinka 2011</LINK>). A drug's susceptibility to oxidative hepatic metabolism and its influence on cytochrome P450 enzyme function in the liver can largely determine the duration and intensity of the pharmacological action of that drug, and its interaction with other drugs. Levetiracetam is advantaged by a lack of oxidative hepatic metabolism or influence on cytochrome P450 enzyme function. Dosing is thus simplified in both adults and children by linear, dose-proportional kinetics. Plasma concentrations of levetiracetam peak at one hour, and a steady-state concentration is reached by 48 hours with repeated dosing (usually twice daily). The drug shows no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other AEDs or with drugs such as warfarin, digoxin, and the oral contraceptive pill; which all interact with the aforementioned hepatic systems. Clearance is exclusively renal: 66% unchanged and 24% as an inactive metabolite following hydrolysis of its acetamide group in the blood. Clearance is 30% to 40% higher in children and it is impaired in elderly people or in patients with renal impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Pellock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the review</HEADING>
<P>This is a Cochrane Review that takes the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis. In this review, we assess the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as adjuvant (add-on) therapy in epilepsy patients suffering from focal seizures. Data are extracted from randomised, placebo-controlled trials. This is an update to a review first published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>) as part of an ongoing series of reviews investigating second-generation AEDs.</P>

<P>Participants had to meet all of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>any age, any gender, any ethnic background;</LI>
<LI>experiencing drug-resistant focal epilepsy: that is experiencing focal seizures with or without impairment of consciousness or awareness, with or without evolution to bilateral, convulsive seizures (involving tonic, clonic, or tonic and clonic components). There has been lack of consensus between studies when defining drug resistance. Therefore, in order to allow a fair and inclusive evaluation of all trials that have been said to involve drug-resistant participants, a specific cut-off for number of background AEDs and the time period on these was not set. Instead, the requirement was for trials to have described participants on AEDs as having 'failed to respond' or having 'refractory', 'drug-resistant', or 'uncontrolled' epilepsy (or words to that effect). Information was then collected on the duration of epilepsy, the number of AEDs tried and the length of time during which seizures had not responded to those AEDs, and the minimum number of seizures required during that time for participants to have been included in the trial. Where relevant, a subgroup analysis was conducted to compare primary outcomes between studies where the mean duration of epilepsy was shorter (&lt; 12 months) and longer (&#8805; 12 months).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of people with a 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency in the treatment period compared to the pre-randomisation baseline period was chosen as the primary outcome. It was chosen as it is commonly reported in this type of study, and can be calculated for studies that do not report this outcome provided that baseline seizure data were reported. For the purposes of this review, people who achieved 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency were termed 'responders'.</P>
<P>Also provided was the proportion of people who did not achieve 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency, termed 'non-responders'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Treatment withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of people having treatment withdrawn during the course of the treatment period was used as a measure of global effectiveness. Treatment is likely to be withdrawn due to adverse effects, lack of efficacy or a combination of both, and this is an outcome to which the individuals make a direct contribution. In trials of short duration, it is likely that adverse effects will be the most common reason for withdrawal.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Adverse effects</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(a) Five most common adverse effects</HEADING>

<LI>dizziness;</LI>
<LI>fatigue;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">(c) Behavioural adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of people experiencing adverse effects pertaining to changes in behaviour (e.g. aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depression, hostility, and irritability). Clinicians often consider changes in behaviour to be common adverse effects of levetiracetam (<LINK REF="REF-Asconap_x00e9_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asconapé 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penovich-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penovich 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>At present, there is no consensus as to which instruments should be used to assess the effects of AEDs on cognition, and as a result this has been approached in a heterogeneous way (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1998</LINK>).

<P>Two review authors (GM and PD) independently assessed trials for their risks of possessing the risks of bias listed below. Any disagreements were settled by discussion with a third review author (AM). Where possible, published data were used, with unpublished data sought when details were unclear or unavailable.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Selection bias: were there adequate methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment? Methods considered to confer a low risk of selection bias included those using random numbers tables/electronically generated random numbers for random sequence generation, and those using allocation of sequentially numbered sealed packages of medication, sealed opaque envelopes, or central/telephone randomisation for allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>Performance bias: was<I> </I>knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel adequately prevented during the study? Methods considered to confer a low risk of performance bias include using packaging and tablets that were identical for levetiracetam and placebo.</LI>
<LI>Detection bias: was<I> </I>knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors prevented during the study? Studies were regarded as possessing low risks of this bias when it was specifically described that investigators/outcome assessors were blinded to treatment assignment.</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Studies were regarded as possessing low risks of this bias when sufficient data were provided to allow an intention to treat (ITT) as well as best and worst case sensitivity analysis to be conducted (see<I> </I>'Analysis').</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias: were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? Risks were regarded as low when the results of all outcomes measured (where the outcome was also relevant to this review) were published.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition to providing overall estimates, a subgroup analysis that excluded trials with unclear or high risks of any of the biases was performed for the primary outcome measure (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Efficacy and adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity between trials was checked for each outcome using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity. Provided no significant heterogeneity was present (P &lt; 0.05), analysis used a fixed-effect model. Where significant heterogeneity was present, logistic regression was used to investigate the heterogeneity (see<I> </I>'Regression analysis'). The preferred estimator was the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) (note:<I> </I>the Peto odds ratio was the preferred estimator in the original review). For the outcomes 50% reduction in seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were quoted. For individual adverse effects, 99% CI were quoted to make allowance for multiple testing.</P>
<P>All analyses included all participants in the treatment groups to which they had been allocated. For the efficacy outcome (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) three analyses were undertaken.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary ITT analysis</HEADING>
<P>For this, all randomised participants were analysed in the treatment group to which they had been allocated, irrespective of the treatment that they actually received. Participants randomised but excluded from analysis (e.g. for not completing follow-up or with inadequate seizure data) were assumed non-responders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Worse-case analysis</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Best-case analysis</HEADING>
<P>Participants randomised but excluded from analysis (e.g. for not completing follow-up or with inadequate seizure data) were assumed responders in the levetiracetam group and non-responders in the placebo group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Regression analysis to investigate heterogeneity and dose response</HEADING>
<P>Reduction in seizure frequency was reduced to a binary variable, with 'success' defined as achieving 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, as this is the outcome usually reported in trial publications.</P>
<P>Logistic regression was used to investigate heterogeneity in 'treatment success', and treatment withdrawal owing to the study location, dose, year of publication, and duration of titration period and maintenance period.</P>
<P>Placebo was defined as a dose of zero. Dose, log(dose + 1) and dose as a factor, year of publication directly and as a factor, and duration of titration period and maintenance periods directly and as factors were considered as explanatory variables. Terms were also added for trials according to country or continents from which the majority of participants had been recruited. The best regression models for dose-response relationships, adjusting for other factors, were chosen using AIC, the package R, which implements generalised linear models (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data for these outcomes were summarised in tables and in the text.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>The GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>) were used to provide a Summary of findings (SOF) table outlining the overall quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on most important outcomes (i.e. 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, and the five most common adverse effects). Within this, 'assumed risk'<I> </I>(also called baseline risk) is the control event rate and is therefore a measure of the typical burden of these outcomes, and 'corresponding risk' is a measure of the burden of the outcomes after the intervention is applied (i.e. the risk of an outcome in levetiracetam-treated people based on the relative magnitude of an effect and assumed (baseline) risk). The GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence into one of four grades:</P>
<OL>
<LI>high:<I> </I>further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect;</LI>
<LI>moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;</LI>
<LI>low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate;</LI>
<LI>very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A judgement was made on the individual trials used to provide the pooled effect estimates and the quality of evidence was then downgraded by the presence of i) bias, ii) inconsistency, iii) indirectness, iv) imprecision, and v) publication bias; and upgraded by the presence of i) a large effect and ii) a dose-response gradient. Only studies with no threats to validity (not downgraded for any reason) can be upgraded.</P>

For the <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK> trial, participants had to have experienced uncontrolled focal epilepsy for at least two years, with a minimum of 12 focal seizures within 12 weeks before study selection and two focal seizures occurring per four weeks during the 12-week baseline period. This was on a background of at least two AEDs taken simultaneously or consecutively. For the <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK> trial, participants had to have experienced uncontrolled focal epilepsy for a minimum of six months, with a minimum of one focal seizure during the four weeks prior to screening. This was on a background of one or two AEDs. Across the remaining trials, the overall mean duration of epilepsy was 18 years (± five years standard deviation (SD), range seven to 26 years). Within these, the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial required a minimum of at least four seizures in the six months prior to study entry; the <LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK> trials required at least two seizures per four weeks in their 12- and eight-week baseline periods, respectively; and the remaining six trials required at least four seizures per four weeks in their eight- or 12-week baseline periods (<LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>). This was on a background of one to three AEDs. The mean duration of epilepsy across all included trials did not range below 12 months.</P>
<P>Treatment periods consisted of the combination of an up-titration and a maintenance phase in all but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK> did not involve up-titration). Duration of the treatment periods ranged from 12 to 24 weeks between trials (up-titration range zero to four weeks, maintenance range eight to 24 weeks). The doses of levetiracetam tested were 60 mg/kg/day for children, and a range of 1000 mg/day to 4000 mg/day for adults. The <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK> trial was the only one in which an extended-release preparation of levetiracetam was tested (1000 mg dose). The <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial was the only one in which a 4000 mg dose of levetiracetam was tested. For the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial, uniform baseline seizure data were not collected for the trials participants. As a result, we were unable to calculate 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency for this trial. For the remaining 10 trials (1446 adults, 296 children) we were able to calculate a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Data for treatment withdrawal were available for all trials, while data for adverse effects were available for all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>). Generally, trials published an adverse effect if 5% or more of the participants in any treatment group were affected, but in the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK> trials this threshold was raised to 10%.</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK>) provided outcome data for cognitive as well as behavioural and emotional effects in children. Seventy-three of the 99 participants randomised in this trial were assessed with the relevant instruments.

Eight of the 11 trials described as RCTs provided details of an adequate method of sequence generation and allocation concealment to qualify them as possessing low risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK>).

For the <LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK> trial, randomisation was achieved using a minimisation programme, which was concealed by using 'telephone randomisation'. Participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to levetiracetam or placebo. For the <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK> trial, randomisation and allocation concealment were achieved by using an interactive voice response system. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to levetiracetam or placebo. A random numbers table was used for sequence generation in the <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK> trial, and participants received an exclusive random number consecutively on entry into the trial, with medication packaged by UCB S.A. Pharma.</P>
<P>Risk of selection bias was regarded as unclear in the remaining three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK>), for which full details on the method of random list generation or allocation concealment were not provided. In the <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK> trial, randomisation codes were generated by the study sponsor (no further specification given), with participants assigned a randomisation number and given levetiracetam or placebo accordingly. An adequate method of allocation concealment was described in this trial (concealment via the use of numbered containers). For the <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK> trials, details on the method of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not provided, although in the latter trial it was described that participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to levetiracetam or placebo, and that randomisation was stratified for age (four to seven, eight to 12, 13 to 16 years) and number of concomitant AEDs (one or two).</P>
<P>All trials were described as double-blind trials. Nine of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>) provided details that packaging and tablets were identical for levetiracetam and placebo and were therefore regarded as possessing a low risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel). For the remaining two trials, in which the method used to blind participants and personnel was not described, risk of performance bias was deemed unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK>). The risk of detection bias was regarded as low in eight trials that provided details that the investigators were blinded to treatment assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>), and unclear in three trials that did not provide details that the investigators were blinded to treatment assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK>). All trials were viewed as having low risks of attrition and selective reporting biases aside from the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial (high risk); for which uniform baseline seizure data were not reported and for which there were discrepancies in the reported number of patients per treatment group (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, the following six RCTs were viewed as possessing a low risk of all of five types of bias (selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias): <LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Empirical data summary</HEADING>
<P>At every dose analysed (adults and children combined), levetiracetam statistically significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This can be viewed as strong evidence that levetiracetam has a positive effect on this outcome. The naive estimates, ignoring dose, show children as better responders than adults, with 52% and 39% of children and adults on levetiracetam responding, respectively. A quarter of children and 16% of adults responded on placebo (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The Number of participants Needed to Treat for an additional Beneficial effect (NNTB) to get a responder with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency during treatment on levetiracetam was four (95% CI three to seven) for children and five (95% CI four to six) for adults. In other words, one additional child or adult may respond for every four or five children or adults, respectively, that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Heterogeneity summary</HEADING>
<P>A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity for a response to levetiracetam indicates significant levels of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 23.17, degrees of freedom (df) = 9, P = 0.006). This signifies that there was significant variation (inconsistency) in the magnitude of the positive effect of levetiracetam. This means that while we can be confident that there was likely to be a positive effect from levetiracetam, we cannot be confident about the size of that positive effect because it was extremely variable from trial to trial. This is illustrated by the observations that the proportion of adults responding varied from 6% to 57%, with a median 36%, and the proportion of children responding was 20% in one trial and 62% in the other trial. It is difficult to be precise about where the true estimate lies. In view of this, results by factors including dose and year of trial publication are given below in order to try and help explain the heterogeneity (see 'Regression models').</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adult trials</HEADING>
<P>The above conclusions remained unchanged when analysis was limited to the trials involving adults (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 20.83, df = 7, P = 0.004). Levetiracetam statistically significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo in adults, but there was also significant statistical heterogeneity between adult trials. Heterogeneity did not exist between the early adult trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>), which were included for this analysis in the original review (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.76, df = 2, P = 0.68). The overall RR for 50% responders across these trials was 3.78 (95% CI 2.62 to 5.44) and 39% of adults in these trials responded to levetiracetam and 9% to placebo (implying a 30% 'real' response rate - i.e. not attributable to placebo). Heterogeneity did not exist between the later adult trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2009</LINK>), published since the original review (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 8.21, df = 4, P = 0.08). The overall RR for 50% responders across these trials was 1.97 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.51) and 49% of adults in these trials responded to levetiracetam and 25% to placebo (implying a 24% real response rate).</P>

<P>Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests for heterogeneity for best-case and worst-case responses to levetiracetam indicate similar trends to those found between trials in the ITT analysis with regard to the existence of heterogeneity. Overall (adults and children combined) there was evidence of a treatment effect from levetiracetam but it was not valid to provide overall estimates given the existence of significant heterogeneity between trials (best case: Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 23.17, df = 9, P = 0.006; worst case: Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 22.78, df = 9, P = 0.007). In both best- and worst-case scenarios such heterogeneity only became negligible when analysis was limited to the trials involving children (where ITT data were identical to the best- and worst-case data) or the adult trials involving doses of 2000 mg levetiracetam (best case: Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.27, df = 1, P = 0.60, worst case: Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.12, df = 1, P = 0.73). The overall RRs for &#8805; 50% response across adult trials involving doses of 2000 mg levetiracetam were 5.09 (95% CI 2.85 to 9.06) and 4.54 (95% CI 2.60 to 7.94) in best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively.</P>
<P>In summary, the results suggest a significant treatment effect in children and adults for all three analyses. There is a relatively consistent existence of statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults (but not children), and this makes it difficult to provide overall estimates for adults.</P>

<P>For adults, the empirical response rate at 2000 mg of levetiracetam (29%, taking into account placebo response) was marginally larger than that at 1000 mg and 3000 mg (20% and 26%, respectively) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The response rates for children were higher than for adults: the RR was 1.33 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.64); the odds were 1.7 times higher for both placebo and treated groups. A quarter of children responded on placebo, and just over half (52%) on treatment with 60 mg/kg/day. As there was only 1 df, fitted response rates were not calculated for children.</P>
<P>The dose levels for adults were confounded with trial, so it was not possible to separate the trial effects and dose effects fully. Only two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK>, had two dose levels in addition to placebo. Models with the log RR for success, that is achieving 50% or greater response, increasing with dose or log(dose + 1) fitted considerably better than models that attributed heterogeneity to trials. Dose on the log scale fitted well, as was confirmed by the estimated coefficients from a model with dose as a factor. The year of publication was strongly associated with response rates, after allowing for log(dose + 1) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), and there was a significant interaction. The fitted placebo response rate increased from 11% in 2000 to 27% in 2009. The fitted response rates on 3000 mg of levetiracetam increased from 42% in 2000 to 55% in 2009.</P>

After adjusting for both dose and year effects, no additional information was provided by titration or trial country. The secular change requires a different explanation.<BR/>

<P>A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity for withdrawal from levetiracetam treatment in adults and children indicates no significant statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 9.60, df = 10, P = 0.48).

<P>When withdrawal data for adults were examined in regression models, it became apparent that there was significant between-trial heterogeneity; most concisely explained by a factor for the length of the maintenance period and the year of publication. These factors give a residual deviance of 21.6 on 17 df. <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> shows the actual and fitted treatment withdrawal rates for adult trials (excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial, for which the maintenance period used (24 weeks) was much longer than in the other trials). Doses of 2000 mg and 4000 mg of levetiracetam were associated with higher withdrawal rates. The withdrawal rates were higher for trials carried out in Europe, but the differences between doses and between Europe, US and China were minimal after allowing for the maintenance period and year of publication. The main differences were that the one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>) with 24 weeks' maintenance and levetiracetam doses 2000 mg and 4000 mg had high withdrawal rates (fitted rate 28%). There was also only one trial with 14 weeks' maintenance (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-_x0026_-Cramer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino &amp; Cramer 2000</LINK>), and the fitted rate was 9%.

<P>The placebo withdrawal rates decreased from 15% in 2000 to 7% in 2009 for most trials when a logistic regression was fitted to the trials excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK> trial. As 24 weeks' maintenance was twice as long as the majority, it is not unreasonable that the withdrawal rate was roughly twice as high (28% compared to 15%).<BR/>

The quality of evidence score was moderate for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency at a 2000-mg dose of levetiracetam and also for treatment withdrawal at a levetiracetam dose of 60 mg/kg/day (each downgraded owing to the presence of an inadequate sample size). A score could not be determined for treatment withdrawal at a levetiracetam dose of 4000 mg because only one trial provided data for this dose. The quality of evidence score for headache and accidental injury (two of the five most common adverse effects) was moderate. This downgrade was as a result of unexplained inter-trial heterogeneity, as evidenced by the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test results (with no explanatory regression modelling). The quality of evidence score was high for all other subsets of the outcomes 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, and five most common adverse effects.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-07 23:18:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review of four trials (adult participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>), conclusions were made that in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam could effectively reduce seizure frequency and could be generally well tolerated as an add-on treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>). These conclusions are unchanged following an update that has added seven subsequently published trials to the meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence used was high (as screened by the GRADE system (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>)). All trials were described by their authors as double-blind RCTs. Our analysis demonstrates that the majority of these trials possessed low risks of bias, and subgroup analysis that has excluded trials with unclear risks or high risks of bias demonstrates no substantive differences in results. Sufficient data were available to perform ITT analysis on all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Betts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Betts 2000</LINK>). Substantial amounts of inter-trial heterogeneity have largely prevented provision of overall estimates of effect (ignoring dose). The most significant contribution of this update has been the introduction of trials that tested levetiracetam in children with focal epilepsy, and it was possible to give overall estimates of effect in children.</P>
<P>The two paediatric trials (<LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levisohn-2009-_x0026_-Loge-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Levisohn 2009 &amp; Loge 2010</LINK>) tested a levetiracetam dose of 60 mg/kg/day or placebo in 296 children. Results for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency demonstrated that this dose of levetiracetam significantly reduced seizure frequency in children on ITT analysis. None of the children contributed to best- and worst-case sensitivity analysis as all who were randomised were also analysed. The RR of 'response' (i.e. achieving 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) between levetiracetam and placebo was 0.91 times in favour of levetiracetam. Although this is small, the actual response rates indicated that that just over half of children achieved 'success' on levetiracetam. This suggests that at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, levetiracetam may be expected to be effective in 25% of children (having taken into account a 25% placebo response). This prediction is based on actual response rates, and more trials will be needed if a fitted estimate is to be calculated that is meaningfully different from the actual response rates. The results demonstrate that one additional child may respond for every four children that have received add-on levetiracetam rather than placebo. This is a favourable result given that epilepsy is particularly frequent in children, as highlighted earlier. Although it is statistically valid for us to provide these overall estimates of effect for levetiracetam in children (no significant heterogeneity present on Chi<SUP>2</SUP> testing), with only two trials being included it is not easy to detect heterogeneity. Indeed, the existence of only two RCTs highlights how there is currently relatively little in the way of RCTs testing levetiracetam in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A meta-analysis across these two trials was particularly important given that much of the clinical opinion of levetiracetam use in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy has come from consideration of various uncontrolled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Verrotti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrotti 2010</LINK>). Of interest, subsequent to the publication of <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2006</LINK>, levetiracetam received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as an add-on drug in the treatment of children aged four to 16 years with focal epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Verrotti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrotti 2010</LINK>). This meta-analysis provides strong evidence to back up the commonly accepted view that levetiracetam is effective in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Verrotti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrotti 2010</LINK>). Interestingly, the results also suggest that the odds of being a responder to levetiracetam may well be greater for children than for adults. The response rate in children was around 4% to 13% greater than in adults. A 25% placebo response was found across paediatric trials. This is slightly larger than the expected 19% placebo response commonly described in trials involving children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Guekht-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guekht 2010</LINK>). The explanation for this enlarged placebo response is unclear as there were no important differences between the paediatric populations recruited in these two trials from those usually recruited. However, it may have implications for the design of future trials in which levetiracetam is compared to placebo in a randomised controlled fashion.</P>
<P>For our global outcome treatment withdrawal, we have insufficient evidence to conclude that levetiracetam is more likely to be withdrawn than placebo in children.</P>
<P>No individual adverse effect was significantly associated with levetiracetam over placebo in children. The CI for the most common adverse effect (somnolence) was wide, as were the CIs for aggressive or hostile behaviour, accidental injury, and fatigue. This raises the possibility of substantial rates of these adverse effects in children on levetiracetam. Other literature concludes that the drug is safe and tolerated well in children, with many of the adverse effects being mild, transient, or reversible (<LINK REF="REF-Verrotti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrotti 2010</LINK>). We have insufficient evidence in this review to disagree with such conclusions. In a specific analysis of the combination of adverse effects pertaining to changes in behaviour, a high proportion of children (around 20%) were affected, where these were (in combination) significantly associated with levetiracetam over placebo. In view of this, it is likely that some changes in behaviour may be common in children taking levetiracetam. It is difficult to ascertain in what form these might manifest, as the individual behavioural changes themselves were insignificant statistically, and a rather heterogeneous set of words pertaining to changes in behaviour was used across trials. Although it was concise to combine such words into one analysis of 'behavioural adverse effects', such a method means the conclusion drawn must be interpreted with caution given that the apparently increased absolute risk for children and present statistical significance could arise simply by virtue of an arbitrary combination being made. When specific tools were used to assess behavioural and emotional effects of levetiracetam in children, the results indicated that those taking levetiracetam fared worse than those taking placebo in measures of aggressive behaviour, leading to similar results for externalising syndromes and total problems. This was evidenced by one trial. As we made no attempt at a meta-analysis of the data reviewed from neuropsychological tests, we have insufficient evidence from this to make firm conclusions about the behavioural and emotional effects of levetiracetam on children. When taken in combination, our two analyses of behavioural effects (i.e. an analysis of adverse effects pertaining to changes in behaviour and a review of data from neuropsychological tests) do seem to suggest that some adverse changes in behaviour are likely in children on levetiracetam. The general consensus in literature is that levetiracetam does demonstrate some unfavourable behavioural effects in children (<LINK REF="REF-Verrotti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrotti 2010</LINK>), but this is yet to be validated. A future review in which the relative frequency of changes in behaviour, once they have been ranked by their level of severity, is analysed may be useful given that it is the severity of such behavioural effects that is most meaningful to clinicians and patients.</P>
<P>In adults, levetiracetam demonstrated statistically significant efficacy over placebo in the outcome of 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, at all doses. There were no substantive differences in results between our ITT analysis and the sensitivity best- and worst-case analyses. Results for an overall effect (ignoring dose) indicated significant statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults, and therefore it did not seem reasonable to give overall estimates of effect. It is likely that much of the heterogeneity can be explained by different doses of levetiracetam tested and different years of publication for the trials - as evidenced by the strong association of these factors with response rates during regression analysis. Response rates increased over time in both the levetiracetam and placebo groups. It was not possible to separate the dose effects and the trial year effects fully. Response rates to AEDs and placebo have been shown to increase over time in other literature as well (<LINK REF="REF-Guekht-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guekht 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rheims-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rheims 2011</LINK>), most notably in one review and meta-analysis of factors determining response rates during RCTs of adjuvant-therapy testing AEDs in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Rheims-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rheims 2011</LINK>). It was suggested, in the latter review, that one of the reasons for the time-dependent increase in response rates might be a change in population characteristics, such as an increasing proportion of patients recruited from Asian countries in later trials (<LINK REF="REF-Rheims-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rheims 2011</LINK>). The results of our regression analysis, in which we added terms for country or continents from which the majority of participants had been recruited, indicate that while response rates were lower for European trials and trials in the US, these factors were less associated with heterogeneity than were drug dose or trial publication year. As mentioned earlier, levetiracetam is not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver, therefore there is little biological reason to assume that it has differing efficacy in populations from different countries (<LINK REF="REF-Crepeau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepeau 2010</LINK>). In view of this and the significant levels of heterogeneity found between trials, we cannot confidently say that levetiracetam demonstrates differing efficacy in different populations. The causes of the observed time-dependent increases in response rates remain to be determined.</P>
<P>For the two trials that tested levetiracetam on adults at a dose of 2000 mg (312 participants), the results were sufficiently similar to be combined to give overall estimates of effect. Although it is valid to provide these estimates it is also important to note, as was mentioned earlier, that with only two trials available it is not easy to detect heterogeneity. At the 2000 mg dose, 37% of those treated with levetiracetam achieved 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency on ITT analysis, as compared to 8% in the placebo group. On this analysis, the RR of 'response' between levetiracetam and placebo was 3.91 times in favour of levetiracetam. It is unclear how precise this estimate is given that the accompanying CI was wide. The upper CI was high (8.77) suggesting that the seizure-reduction capacity of levetiracetam at this dose may well be very large. Indeed, notwithstanding heterogeneity, RRs favoured levetiracetam over placebo most strongly at 2000 mg compared to other doses, with actual responder rates also being highest at this dose (although only marginally). The NNTB at this dose was as low as that of children (four people). In view of these observations, further trials testing a 2000-mg dose of levetiracetam are needed to improve the precision of the effect estimate and to test whether this is indeed the most effective dose. As the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was classed as moderate on the GRADE score, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>For our global outcome of treatment withdrawal, we have insufficient evidence to conclude that levetiracetam is more likely to be withdrawn than placebo in adults. When analysed using regression modelling, the data unsurprisingly suggest that longer maintenance periods are associated with greater rates of treatment withdrawal. The maintenance periods used ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. It is unlikely that these lengths of treatment time are significantly different from each other clinically, but rather all fall under the broad category of 'long-term treatment'. Therefore, the accompanying differences in withdrawal rates found here are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. However, these differences may be helpful in planning future trial design. Withdrawal rates tended to fall with increasing year of trial publication. The explanation for this secular trend is less clear.</P>
<P>For adverse effects, somnolence and infection were significantly associated with levetiracetam. This slightly contrasts with results in the original review, where dizziness and infection were significantly associated with levetiracetam (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>). The likelihood is that any one of these three adverse effects will contribute to the side-effects profile of levetiracetam. Changes in behaviour were infrequent in adults and not statistically significant. This may be surprising given that such changes (particularly aggressive behaviour) are often said to be seen frequently and advised about, or both, in clinic. The reasons behind this clinical and literary discrepancy are unclear. One possible explanation may be that clinicians frequently see patients with a complex psychiatric background that puts them at a higher risk of behavioural changes, while participants with psychiatric problems are routinely excluded from RCTs. It may also be that changes in behaviour manifest soon after starting levetiracetam, meaning that it is withdrawn before the eight-week minimum treatment period that was set for included trials in this review.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We have insufficient data and analysis to make firm conclusions about the cognitive effects of levetiracetam and its effect on QoL. This update contributes only one more trial to the investigation of these outcomes, and this was a small trial (28 participants). We made no attempt at a meta-analysis across data pertaining to cognitive effects and QoL. Based on the descriptive analysis conducted, the impression is that levetiracetam does not impair cognitive function, and that it confers some positive effects on QoL. It is difficult to be sure of the real life impact of these changes. The conclusions remain to be validated in a more detailed investigation of the effects of levetiracetam on cognition and QoL. These outcomes are important because they can place clinical trial evidence of clinical efficacy into the context of meaningful improvement for patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kerr-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The influence of a possible information bias cannot be excluded in this review. The original review (<LINK REF="REF-Chaisewikul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisewikul 2001</LINK>) had unpublished data confidentially made available for inclusion, while this update had no such data made available for new trials. To illustrate this limitation, the risks of selection, performance, and detection biases were initially regarded as 'unclear' for the <LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Menachem-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Menachem 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shorvon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shorvon 2000</LINK> trials (included in the original review). This judgement was made based on the information available in the published versions of these trials. These trials were regarded as possessing a 'low risk' of these biases only after we had the opportunity to extract further data from the unpublished scripts. It stands to reason that similar discrepancies in information may exist for the other trials regarded as having an 'unclear risk' of certain biases in this review. Most RCTs implement various adequate methods of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and investigator blinding in their protocols, but not all publish details about these methods. Future trial publications should aim to reduce this discrepancy in information in order to allow a clear interpretation of the risks of bias. The influence of this possible information bias on the conclusions of this review is likely to be small given that a predominant number of trials had low risks of bias and a subgroup analysis where trials with unclear or high risks of bias were excluded demonstrated negligible changes to the results.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The trials analysed in this review treated patients with levetiracetam for only 12 to 24 weeks. Drug-resistant patients need even longer-term treatment than this, and the results here are not applicable to that period. The conclusions on children are based on a sample size of fewer than 300 participants. More studies, particularly longer-term studies and studies on children, will be needed before complete evaluation of the effectiveness of levetiracetam is possible.</P>
<P>Although the results of this review indicate that levetiracetam is an effective add-on treatment for both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, it cannot tell us how levetiracetam compares with other AEDs in this scenario. This is an extremely important issue for clinicians who are faced with an ever increasing number of AEDs to choose from, and head-to-head trials are needed to provide the evidence that is needed to enable clinicians to make an evidence-based choice between AEDs. This review focuses on the use of levetiracetam in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment in people with generalised epilepsy. Likewise, no inference can be made about the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam when used as monotherapy.</P>

<P>Levetiracetam is effective as add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The most significant contribution of this update is the finding that one can expect a quarter of children to be responsive to adjuvant levetiracetam at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The drug is effective in adults and at a dose of 2000 mg one could expect around 30% of adults to be responsive. One additional child taking 60 mg/kg/day of levetiracetam may respond for every four children that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo. This number needed to treat is the same for adults on 2000 mg of levetiracetam. Owing to significant levels of inter-trial heterogeneity, we are unable to provide overall estimates of effect for the doses of 1000 mg and 3000 mg of levetiracetam; although there is strong evidence that these doses are effective as well. We had insufficient data to provide details on the seizure-reduction efficacy of levetiracetam when used at a dose of 4000 mg. All doses appear well tolerated in both adults and children although there is a possibility of adverse changes in behaviour in children, potentially affecting around 20%. It is reasonable to continue the use of adjuvant levetiracetam in clinical practice for treating adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The conclusions cannot be applied to levetiracetam use in generalised epilepsy or to its use as monotherapy.</P>
