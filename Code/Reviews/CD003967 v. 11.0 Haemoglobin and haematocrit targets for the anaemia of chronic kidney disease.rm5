<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Having too few red blood cells (anaemia) makes a person feel tired and unwell. Blood transfusions or drugs can be given to increase red blood cell levels (haemoglobin). Having too many red blood cells can lead to blockages in catheters and other vascular access for patients on dialysis. It can also cause high blood pressure. This review of clinical studies found that increasing haemoglobin to high levels lowered the chance of a person having a seizure, but increased blood pressure. Haemoglobin levels above 133 g/L did not reduce the risk of death in people with heart and kidney disease. </P>

<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty two trials (3707 patients) were included. Hb &#8805; 133 g/L was not associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality compared with 120 g/L in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In pre-dialysis patients, there was a significantly lower end of treatment creatinine clearance with Hb &lt; 120 g/L compared to &gt; 130 g/L (MD -4.17, 95% CI -6.33 to -2.02) but no significant difference in the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.22). Lower Hb targets resulted in an increased risk for seizures (RR 5.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 24.34) and a reduced risk of hypertensive episodes (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.76). There were no significant differences in the risk of vascular access thrombosis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was no significant difference in the risk of death for low (&lt; 120 g/L) versus higher Hb targets (&gt;133 g/L). Lower Hb targets were significantly associated with an increased risk for seizures but a reduced risk of hypertension. In general study quality was poor. There is a need for more adequately powered, well-designed and reported trials. Trials should be pragmatic, focusing on hard end-points (mortality, ESKD, major side effects) or outcomes which were previously not studied adequately (e.g. seizures, quality of life).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-09 11:12:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of anaemia varies with the degree of renal impairment in CKD and once end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) occurs, 60-80% of patients are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Obrador-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obrador 2001</LINK>). Anaemia develops once renal function decreases to less than 50% due to a deficiency in endogenous erythropoietin production by the kidney, decreased red cell survival, blood losses and increased red blood cell destruction once the patient begins dialysis treatment, particularly haemodialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Caro-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caro 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaemia reduces physical capacity, well-being, neurocognitive function and energy level and worsens quality of life (QoL), both in pre-dialysis and dialysis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Klang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klang 1996</LINK>). Anaemia also induces adaptive cardiovascular mechanisms which aim to ensure no changes in tissue oxygen supply. This results in left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dilatation and myocardial ischaemia, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death as well as for the progression of kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eckardt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckardt 2001</LINK>). It is plausible that reversing anaemia may reduce these risks (<LINK REF="REF-Humphries-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humphries 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMahon-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valderrabano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valderrabano 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current treatment options for the anaemia of CKD include blood transfusion, recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) &#945; or &#946; and darbepoetin alfa. The latter are growth factors, which act on bone marrow erythroid precursors stimulating production of erythrocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Nissenson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissenson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sikole-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikole 1997</LINK>). Treatment of anaemia improves muscle strength and function, cardiac function, cognitive and brain electrophysiological function because of improved peripheral oxygen supply (<LINK REF="STD-McMahon-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 2000b</LINK>). Aspects of the patient's QoL such as fatigue, depression and relationship with others are positively affected by an increased haemoglobin (Hb) level (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nissenson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissenson 2001</LINK>) but higher Hb levels may also lead to an increased risk of vascular access thrombosis, hypertension, and an increased number of adverse cardiovascular events. Also, reaching and maintaining higher Hb targets implies major costs (<LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valderrabano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valderrabano 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Despite major uncertainties concerning the benefits and harms of low versus high Hb target levels, there has been a consistent trend towards higher Hb levels across all age, gender and race categories during the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Obrador-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obrador 2001</LINK>). Guidelines have been developed for Hb targets (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Published guidelines on haemoglobin and haematocrit targets in patients with CKD)</I> and despite an emerging body of evidence indicating the potential harms of higher Hb levels (<LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK>) practice patterns are not changing, wide variation in anaemia management still exists between and within countries and new trials are not in progress (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2001</LINK>). Hence, the Hb target debate remain still open (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the benefits and harms of low and high Hb or haematocrit (HCT) targets in the treatment of the anaemia of CKD.</P>

<P>The review was originally undertaken by four authors (GS, JCC, CM, FPS). The current (2006) update was carried out by GS, SN and JCC. Titles and abstracts of updated search strategies were screened by (SN) and (GS), who discarded studies that were not applicable based on the inclusion criteria. Studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on trials were retained initially and their full-text version analysed. Authors (SN, GS) independently assessed retrieved abstracts and, if necessary the full text, to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was carried out by the same authors independently using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one trial existed, only the publication with the most complete data was included. Any further information required from the original author was requested by written correspondence and any relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review. Disagreements were resolved in consultation among authors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study quality</HEADING>
<P>The methods quality of studies to be included was assessed independently by (GS) and (SN) without blinding to authorship or journal using the checklist developed by the Cochrane Renal Group.

<P>For all dichotomous outcomes (e.g. overall and cardiovascular mortality, serious cardiovascular events, doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD requiring RRT) results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual studies. Data were pooled using the Der Simonian-Laird random effects model but a fixed effects model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers.</P>
<P>Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g. systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure levels, duration of hospitalisation, variations of EPO alpha, beta or epoetin alpha dose, QoL etc.), the mean difference (MD) was used. Heterogeneity was analysed using a &#967; test on N-1 degrees of freedom (Q statistic), with a P = 0.05 used for statistical significance, and with the I statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned to explore how possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. overt or non-overt cardiovascular disease, time on dialysis, time on pre-dialysis treatment) might influence treatment effect. It was also planned that if sufficient RCTs were identified, an attempt would be made to examine for publication bias using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The combined search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the specialised registry of the Cochrane Renal Group identified a total of 1444 articles of which 1395 were excluded. The major reasons for exclusion were that selected studies were not randomised or were randomised trials evaluating other interventions (e.g. subcutaneous versus intravenous EPO treatment for anaemia of CKD) or because only haemorrheological outcomes were reported (e.g. blood viscosity, haematopoietic progenitor cell assays). Full-text assessment of 49 potentially eligible papers identified 22 eligible trials (3707 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bahlmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bahlmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Berns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brandt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conlon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Conlon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gouva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gouva 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parfrey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Parfrey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revicki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Revicki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Roger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sikole-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sikole 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teehan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Teehan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1990</LINK>).

<P>Authors of fourteen trials were contacted for clarifications relating to their publications and request for additional unpublished information. Seven authors replied to the request. One trial is still awaiting publication, but analyses have been presented in international conferences (<LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK>).

<P>Overall, two groups of studies were identified in this review. In the first group (10 trials, 3069 patients), patients were specifically randomised to a low (also defined "subnormal") versus a high (also defined "normal") Hb target. The higher Hb value was always achieved and maintained with sustained EPO doses (<LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brandt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gouva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gouva 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parfrey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Parfrey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Roger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavian 2003</LINK>).

Additional exclusion criteria were then added to this trial, resulting in the exclusion of 33 enrolled patients with cardiovascular impairment. In the second group of RCTs (12 trials, 638 patients) identified in this review, patients were randomised to treatment with EPO or placebo/no treatment, which was equivalent to randomisation to a higher (EPO treated patients) versus a lower (placebo treated patients) Hb target (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bahlmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bahlmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuriyama-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kuriyama 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revicki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Revicki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sikole-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sikole 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teehan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Teehan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1990</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-09 11:12:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Our systematic review of trials of Hb targets in patients with the anaemia of CKD identified a number of key findings. Higher Hb targets of 133 g/L or more have not been shown to be associated with the expected survival advantage which was hypothesised in observational studies of patients with CKD, either pre-dialysis or dialysis. In available RCTs, keeping Hb at lower values (&#8804; 100 g/L) has been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of seizures compared to Hb &gt; 100 g/L such that in absolute terms, the risk of seizures is 4% lower (95% CI 3% to 11%) with higher Hb target levels and for every 25 patients with Hb target levels between 100-133 g/L, seizures will be avoided in one patient. Available trials have also shown that lower Hb targets (&#8804; 100 g/L) are associated with a reduced risk of patients presenting with hypertensive episodes compared to Hb &gt; 100 g/L (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.76).<B> </B>In absolute terms, there is a 16% higher risk (95% CI 8% to 24%) that patients in the high target group will present new hypertensive episodes, that is for every 6.2 patients with a Hb &gt; 100 g/L, one patient will present an hypertensive episode requiring additional antihypertensive treatment. Finally, in available trials the risk of vascular access thrombosis does not appear to vary at different Hb target levels, although this has long been considered a major complication of increased Hb levels. Hypertension is a well known adverse effect of EPO treatment and our review confirms this finding (<LINK REF="STD-McMahon-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 2000b</LINK>).</P>
<P>For mortality and cardiovascular events, inclusion of the four new trials published since inception of this systematic review (n = 926 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Gouva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gouva 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parfrey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Parfrey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Roger 2004a</LINK>) has not contributed substantial changes to our key findings. The findings of this review are still mainly influenced by the study of <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK> which found an association of higher mortality with "normal" Hb targets (Hb 140 g/L) in the presence of cardiovascular impairment, while all other trials are too small to confirm the finding independently or contribute little to the meta-analysis. Importantly, relevant data from the two other trials of Hb targets and anaemia management in CKD identified by our searching (<LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK>) could not be incorporated in our analyses, since they are yet unpublished. It should be noted that the <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK> trial data has been in the public domain for some time (<LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK>). Based upon public presentations and press-release data, both the <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK> studies have documented no significant improvement in survival/cardiovascular events with higher Hb levels, in CKD (non-dialysis) populations. The recent information on <LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK> data released by Ortho-Biotech reported "a statistically significant higher incidence of composite endpoint events - consisting of mortality, stroke, heart attack and hospitalisation due to congestive heart failure - in the group of patients treated to the investigational Hb target of 13.5 g/dL, as compared to the group treated to the Hb target that is consistent with the current product label, 11.3 g/dL".</P>
<P>In relation to the outcome of seizures, these are reported as a complication of EPO in the product information sheet. However, this systematic review indicates that EPO may be protective against seizures. There is some uncertainty with this finding (which was identified only in the trials of EPO versus placebo and not in the trials of higher versus lower Hb targets) due to the small number of trials (five RCTs) reporting data for this outcome. These five studies enrolled small numbers of patients in each Hb target group and very small numbers of events were reported. The physiological rationale underlying the protective role of EPO against seizures could be the increased peripheral cerebral oxygenation of neurons and the observation that neurons develop EPO receptors during ischaemia, with EPO acting as a neuroprotective agent independent of its effects on Hb (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2002</LINK>). Alternatively, this finding could simply be spurious, resulting from a type 2 statistical error. The findings of our study are broadly consistent with the results of an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report on EPO use for anaemia of CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Flamm-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flamm 2001</LINK>), however unlike the AHRQ report we also looked at the outcome of seizures.</P>
<P>Access thrombosis is another recognised complication of EPO treatment particularly when high Hb levels are achieved, but our review does not allow confirmation of this finding.</P>
<P>EPO is widely reported to improve QoL. We found that QoL data was problematic because non-validated scales were used for its assessment, authors often did not pre-specify the events to be analysed and only presented positive results. Reporting of QoL improvement was often based upon improvement of individual items of QoL scales rather than an analysis of all aspects involved. It is very likely that EPO does improve QoL when higher Hb targets are reached, but it is unclear whether this is a global improvement or only an improvement of some aspects of the QoL parameters involved.</P>
<P>Finally, another increasingly recognised effect of EPO use is renoprotection, with improvement of renal function and slowing of the progression of CKD. We were not able to demonstrate any effect of EPO versus placebo or a higher versus a lower Hb target level on neither the doubling of serum creatinine concentration, the risk of reaching ESKD requiring renal replacement treatment nor on the end of treatment value of serum creatinine. Interestingly, a lower Hb target level may be associated with a significant reduction in the end of treatment value of creatinine clearance, as shown by <LINK REF="STD-Gouva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gouva 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Roger 2004a</LINK> and supported by the <LINK REF="STD-Scandinavian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scandinavian 2003</LINK> study. The fact that all other measures of renal function were not significantly affected, may be reflective of some inaccuracy of creatinine clearance used as a predictor of renal function with serum creatinine or hard patient-level endpoints (e.g. ESKD or doubling of serum creatinine concentration) providing more conservative estimates.</P>
<P>There are many narrative reviews and observational studies on the very debated topic of optimal Hb targets. Our systematic review, which only included RCT evidence attempting to minimise bias, identified clearly that there is a discrepancy between the results of observational studies addressing the intervention question of optimal Hb targets and those of available RCTs. Recently the ADEMEX study (<LINK REF="REF-ADEMEX-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADEMEX 2002</LINK>) and data from the HEMO study (<LINK REF="REF-HEMO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">HEMO 1999</LINK>) have clearly demonstrated in nephrology that the results of observational studies are not reliable to address intervention questions. Our review also identified that there are major limitations in the number of available RCTs on this topic, (too few) their small sample sizes and suboptimal methods quality.</P>
<P>We also found that more trials are being produced on this topic, but they are unable to contribute substantially given the tendency to rely on surrogate rather than patient level (hard) endpoints. It is important to ascertain if Hb, LVMI and other surrogate indicators often used in trials of anaemia of CKD are valid "surrogate" endpoints. Is Hb itself an appropriate predictor of improvements in the LVMI and survival, and is LVMI a valid predictor of what really matters, which is all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and events? A surrogate is a measurable outcome (e.g. a laboratory test), which is responsive to the effect of an intervention (e.g. increase in Hb with EPO) and is also causally associated with a clinically important outcome (e.g. reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality with EPO). A valid surrogate end-point therefore captures the full effect of an intervention but earlier in the causal chain of events (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temple-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 1999</LINK>). These endpoints are generally preferred to hard end points in RCTs because of reduced costs and sample size needed, shorter study duration, and improved sensitivity to differences in treatment. Other examples of surrogates used in CKD include dialysis adequacy and episodes of acute rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMahon-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">McMahon 2000b</LINK>). However, not all surrogates are valid proxies of clinically important patient-level outcomes. For a surrogate to be valid, two criteria must be met. First, there must be a strong, independent and consistent association between the surrogate and the clinically important outcome, which comes from observational studies and which has been found in the case of Hb and mortality and LVMI and cardiovascular mortality. Second, but more important, there must also be evidence that using an intervention that changes a surrogate (e.g. increase in erythropoietin dose increases Hb levels, or increase in Hb decreases LVMI) results in an expected change in the patient-based outcome distal to the surrogate in the same causal pathway for the disease in question (e.g. increase in Hb reduces mortality, or decrease in LVMI reduces mortality). This more stringent criterion requires a RCT, which measures both the surrogate and the hard endpoint. There are now more than 20 RCTs of anaemia management and Hb targets in CKD, most of which have been conducted in dialysis patients and have relied on surrogate endpoints including Hb and the LVMI but only four, the largest of which was <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK> (n = 1236) conducted in haemodialysis patients, provided patient-level mortality data. Two large trials which will contribute patient-level endpoints have been completed but are yet unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK>). Invariably, in available trials, either no effect on the patient-level outcome (mortality) has been demonstrated when effect on surrogate (Hb or LVMI) endpoints was found, or no difference in both (e.g. no significant reduction in LVMI with higher Hb or erythropoietin doses and no effect on mortality). <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK> and this meta-analysis of the results of all available trials providing mortality data inform us that the benefits of higher Hb targets (reduced risk of seizures) may be outweighed by the harms (i.e. increased risk of hypertension and no significant difference in the risk of death found by any of the smallest trials, with a significant increase with higher Hb targets found by <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>). These findings which were mainly reported in dialysis patients, and are in clear contrast with those of some large observational studies, are now compounded further by the latest trials including <LINK REF="STD-Roger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Roger 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK> studies which are conducted in pre-dialysis patients). These trials failed to show a significant cardiovascular benefit with higher Hb achieved with early treatment of anaemia and only found a significant benefit of higher Hb on quality of life measures. There are also data in patients with anaemia of cancer showing increased mortality and disease progression with higher doses of EPOs which grant significant consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Leyland_x002d_Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyland-Jones 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of our study could also be expressed in absolute terms using representative data from cohort studies to ascertain modification of baseline risk for a given outcome by a higher or a lower Hb value using the estimates of effect obtained from this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Novo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novo 2002</LINK>). Cohort data should be preferred rather than trial data because it is specifically representative of the population of interest, but sometimes this can't be easily obtained, therefore trial data can also be used in the absence of cohort studies. We queried the United States Renal Data System (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2002</LINK>) and found that for every 100 patients with CKD there are 30 patients with new episodes of hypertension and two patients with seizures/year (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2002</LINK>). If we assume that this population has an average Hb value of 120-140 g/L, our review indicates that maintaining a Hb target of 100 g/L avoids approximately 15 hypertensive episodes, but causes 8.5 additional seizures events.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>From the available trial evidence, the benefits associated with higher Hb targets (reduced seizures) may be outweighed by the harms (increased risk of hypertension) in the absence of any data showing significant improvements in the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, and with the <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK> study suggesting a potential increase in the risk with higher Hb targets. Data for patients with CKD and cardiovascular impairment, provided mainly by <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK>, would indicate that the preferred Hb target should be low (Hb &lt;120 g/L). Data relating to other populations (pre-dialysis patients with CKD with and without cardiovascular impairment) are unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials conducted in dialysis patients have not demonstrated a survival advantage of higher Hb targets. There have been substantial expectations from results of trials conducted in pre-dialysis patients, whom are a less ideal population to demonstrate advantages of higher Hb levels given the lower baseline cardiovascular risk. That the study of <LINK REF="STD-Besarab-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Besarab 1998</LINK> was conducted in a high cardiovascular risk populations is a fact, and this was done in the belief that they were the best to benefit from higher Hb targets. In fact, the recently published trial by <LINK REF="STD-Levin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 2005</LINK> was not able to identify any cardiac benefits from higher Hb targets and the results of the <LINK REF="STD-CREATE-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CREATE 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CHOIR-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHOIR 2002</LINK> have confirmed this. It is therefore important to identify clearly the populations that will be included in future trials based upon baseline cardiovascular risk. Addressing optimal Hb targets levels may also not be an ideal endpoint, given that this and other surrogate endpoints have not been properly validated. Importantly, both paediatric and adult CKD registry data have unfortunately shown that despite introduction of a number of novel interventions (including EPOs, novel dialysis techniques, better calcium and phosphate metabolism management, lipid lowering agents) there has not been the expected significant improvement in survival of CKD patients over the last two decades (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). If we really want to improve the survival of these patients, we might need to explore novel interventions and understand better the risk factors for CKD and its outcomes. On the contrary, we are often dwelling on interventions where no substantial evidence of improvements in patient-level endpoints has been found and nor it is likely to be found based on extensive searching (including this systematic review) which has been done already. If more RCTs are conducted in the area of anaemia management, these should be adequately powered, well-designed and rapidly reported. These trials should be pragmatic ('simple') (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1998</LINK>), focusing on hard outcomes and also looking at outcomes which were previously not studied adequately, such as seizures and quality of life. Quality of life must be assessed with validated measures. Given the low likelihood of funding of such trials, an individual patient data meta-analysis and a prospective meta-analysis approach may be considered as valid contributions.</P>
