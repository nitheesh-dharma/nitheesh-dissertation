<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-18 13:02:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sheena Derry">
<P>Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. People with pain are used to test pain killers. They have often had wisdom teeth removed. The pain is often treated with pain killers given by mouth. Results can then be applied to other forms of acute pain.</P>
<P>A series of reviews has looked at how good pain killers are. This review looked at a drug called celecoxib. Celecoxib is most often used for chronic pain caused by arthritis and is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When used for a long time, celecoxib has fewer side effects associated with the digestive system than other NSAIDs.</P>
<P>This review assessed information from 10 studies which used celecoxib for acute pain. Just over 3 in 10 people (33%) taking celecoxib 200 mg, and over 4 in 10 (43%) taking celecoxib 400 mg, experienced good pain relief (at least 50%) compared to about 1 in 10 (range 1% to 11%) with placebo. Comparing the results of the different studies showed that the 200 mg dose of celecoxib was at least as good as aspirin 600 to 650 mg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg for relieving postoperative pain, while a 400 mg dose was at least as good as ibuprofen 400 mg. The number of people who experienced negative (adverse) reactions was similar for celecoxib and placebo, and stopping the medication due to these adverse reactions also occurred at similar rates. One serious adverse event, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), was probably related to celecoxib.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-05 12:53:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This is an update of a review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>in Issue 4, 2008, and updated in Issue 3, 2012. Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor usually prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Its effectiveness in acute pain was demonstrated in the earlier reviews.<BR/>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-10-18 12:58:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>To assess analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-05 12:27:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was to 31 May 2013.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-30 10:05:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-10-18 12:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Two review authors assessed studies for quality and extracted data. We converted summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) into dichotomous information, yielding the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. We used this to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT), for one patient to achieve at least 50% of maximum pain relief with celecoxib who would not have done so with placebo. We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use.<BR/>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-18 13:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Ten studies (1785 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The two new studies in this update had been identified in the earlier update, but data were not available. There remain three potentially relevant unpublished studies for which data are not available at this time.</P>
<P>The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.0) respectively. The median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 hours with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo. The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo. The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and were experienced by a similar proportion of participants in the celecoxib and placebo groups. One serious adverse event that was probably related to celecoxib was reported.</P>

<P>This is an update of a review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>in Issue 4, 2008 and updated in Issue 3, 2012.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-18 13:05:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage, either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care.</P>
<P>This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level. The series includes well-established analgesics such as paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009a</LINK>), diclofenac (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-P-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry P 2009</LINK>), and ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>), and newer cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective analgesics such as lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2010</LINK>) and etoricoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2012</LINK>). An overview brings together the results from all the individual drug reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acute pain trials</HEADING>
<P>Single-dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double-blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter-acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer-acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as the initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful. Results from completed reviews of many different analgesics have been brought together to facilitate (indirect) comparisons in a recently published acute pain overview (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>), and analgesics relevant to dentistry are discussed in <LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2011</LINK>.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-18 13:06:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors or 'coxibs' were developed to address the problem of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). Celecoxib (brand names Celebrex, Celebra, Onsenal) was one of the first of the new generation of NSAIDs known as selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) or 'coxibs', and Celebrex® is currently licensed for the relief of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis pain in many countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and United States of America. The drug is licensed for acute pain in the United States and some other regulatory areas, but not in the United Kingdom. It is available by prescription only in many countries, as 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg capsules, but generic formulations are available in some parts of Asia and the Far East where patents have expired. It is most often used for chronic painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis, where the usual adult dose is 100 mg to 200 mg twice daily. In acute painful conditions, such as postoperative pain and menstrual pain, up to 400 mg is sometimes given as a single or starting dose. In primary care in England in 2010, there were 460,000 prescriptions for celecoxib, with almost equal numbers for the 100 mg and 200 mg doses (<LINK REF="REF-PACT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">PACT 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-18 13:08:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs have pain-relieving, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, and are thought to relieve pain by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases and thus the production of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Prostaglandins occur throughout body tissues and fluids and act to stimulate pain nerve endings and promote or inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Cyclo-oxygenase has at least two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutive while COX-2 is induced at sites of inflammation and produces the prostaglandins involved in inflammatory responses and pain mediation (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). Unlike traditional NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen, the coxibs are selective inhibitors, blocking primarily the action of COX-2, providing pain relief and causing fewer gastrointestinal effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005b</LINK>). In addition, they should not precipitate bleeding events through inhibition of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In common with other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can give rise to fluid retention and renal damage (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2002</LINK>), so particular caution is needed in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). COX-2 inhibitors have been implicated in increased cardiovascular problems in long-term use, but this is complicated by differences in their pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 2009</LINK>). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that prior cardiac damage may be a more important trigger than any particular drug or class of drug (<LINK REF="REF-Ruff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruff 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We also completed a <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> table, using methods adapted from those described by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), with any disagreements resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The following were assessed for each study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to generate the allocation sequence was assessed as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);  high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) - these studies would be excluded; unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. The methods were assessed as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth) - these studies would be excluded; unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). The methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received were assessed. Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias if they stated that they were blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding (e.g. identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell), or at unknown risk if they stated that they were blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved. Single-blind and open studies would be excluded.</LI>
<LI>Size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably due to methodological weaknesses (<LINK REF="REF-Nuesch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuesch 2010</LINK>). Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias if they had &#8805; 200 participants, at unknown risk of they had 50 to 200 participants, and at high risk if they had &lt; 50 participants.</LI>

<P>We followed the QUOROM guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used the number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. We planned analyses for different doses.</P>
<P>For each study we converted the mean TOTPAR, SPID, VAS TOTPAR, or VAS SPID (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) values for active treatment and placebo to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>), and calculated the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). We then converted these proportions into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group.

<P>Eight studies reported some information on use of rescue medication.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of participants using rescue medication over 24 hours</HEADING>
<P>The time at which use of rescue medication was censored varied between studies. The weighted mean proportion of participants requiring rescue medication by 24 hours was 74% for celecoxib 200 mg (133/181), 63% for celecoxib 400 mg (228/364), and 91% for placebo (181/199 participants). Significantly fewer participants used rescue medication with celecoxib than placebo (200 mg: relative risk (RR) 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), NNT to prevent use of rescue medication 4.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 7.7); 400 mg: RB 0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8), NNT to prevent use of rescue medication 3.5 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.6)). The difference between the two doses of celecoxib was not significant (z = 1.37, P = 0.085).</P>
<P>The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication was also reported at eight hours: 44% (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2001</LINK>) and 12 hours: 41% (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2002</LINK>) for celecoxib 200 mg; and at six hours: 24% (<LINK REF="STD-Moberly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moberly 2007</LINK>) for celecoxib 400 mg.</P>

It was unclear in some reports whether the adverse event reports covered only the duration of the trial, or whether they included any adverse events occurring between the end of the trial and a follow-up visit some days later. Only one study arm reported a significant difference between placebo and celecoxib (400 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2002</LINK>). There was no significant difference between celecoxib 400 mg and placebo when studies were pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), or for individual or pooled studies for celecoxib 200 mg (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), so we did not calculate numbers needed to treat to harm (NNHs). Adverse events were generally described as mild to moderate in severity.</P>

<P>Two studies reported serious adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2002</LINK> reported one serious adverse event in each of the 200 mg and 400 mg treatment arms.

The event, rhabdomyolysis, occurred two days after the study and was judged to be probably related to the study medication by the trialists, although the patient had received a number of other medications both pre and post-study. No statistical analysis of serious adverse events was possible.</P>
<P>One adverse event withdrawal was reported for celecoxib 200 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>) and for celecoxib 400 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2007</LINK>), and four for placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2007</LINK>).</P>

Excluding this trial from the primary analysis left dental trials only, giving an RB for treatment compared with placebo of 16 (95% CI 5.1 to 49), and a NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours of 3.2 (95% CI 2.7 to 3.9). This apparently better efficacy in dental trials was due to the fact that the event rate in the placebo group of the orthopaedic trial was much higher (21%) than in the placebo groups of the dental trials (1% to 4%), while the event rate in the celecoxib group of the orthopaedic trial was more similar (39%) to the dental trials (23% to 43%).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-18 14:12:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from two new studies were available for this updated review, although only one study contributed to the primary outcome. Included studies involved 1785 participants of whom 599 received celecoxib 200 mg, 415 received celecoxib 400 mg, and 570 received placebo. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was significantly better for 400 mg (NNT 2.6, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.0) than for 200 mg (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.4 to 5.6) (P = 0.0002). The additional data did not significantly change the result.</P>
<P>Since the same methods and analyses have been conducted, it is possible to compare the NNT for a single dose of oral celecoxib with that of a single dose of other NSAIDs. Analgesics with comparable efficacy to celecoxib 200 mg include aspirin 600 to 650 mg (NNT 4.2, 95% CI 3.8 to 4.6) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>) and paracetamol 1000 mg (NNT 3.6, 95% CI 3.2 to 4.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>). Analgesics with comparable efficacy to celecoxib 400 mg include naproxen 500 to 550 mg (NNT 2.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.3) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009a</LINK>) and ibuprofen 400 mg (NNT 2.5, 95% CI 2.4 to 2.6) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>). An overview of analgesic efficacy in acute pain summarises all the available results (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Significantly fewer participants required rescue medication with celecoxib than with placebo. The NNTs to prevent one patient remedicating within 24 hours were 4.8 for celecoxib 200 mg and 3.5 for celecoxib 400 mg, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.085). The median time to use of rescue medication varied greatly between trials, particularly for the active treatment arms, but was generally longer for celecoxib than placebo, and for celecoxib 400 mg than celecoxib 200 mg. The weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication at 6.6 hours for celecoxib 200 mg and 8.4 hours for celecoxib 400 mg is longer than for some non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400 mg 5.6 hours, diclofenac 50 mg 4.3 hours), though not all (naproxen 500 mg 8.9 hours), but is shorter than other coxibs (etoricoxib 120 mg 20 hours, rofecoxib 50 mg 14 hours, lumiracoxib nine hours). A longer duration of action is desirable in an analgesic, particularly in a postoperative setting where the patient may experience postoperative nausea or be dependent on a third party to respond to a request for rescue medication (or both). </P>
<P>Assessment of adverse events is limited in single-dose studies as the size and duration of the trials permit only the simplest analysis, as has been emphasised previously (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999b</LINK>). There were insufficient data in these studies to compare individual adverse events. There was no significant difference between celecoxib and placebo for numbers of participants experiencing any adverse event in the hours immediately following a single dose of the study medication. Although all but one trial reported this outcome, combining results was potentially hampered by the different periods over which the data were collected. Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity, and were most likely to be related to the anaesthetic or surgical procedure (for example nausea, vomiting, and somnolence). Serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in both celecoxib and placebo treatment arms, but were uncommon and too few for any statistical analysis. It is important to recognise that adverse event analysis after single-dose oral administration will not reflect possible adverse events occurring with use of drugs for longer periods of time. In addition, the numbers of participants are insufficient to detect rare but serious adverse events.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-18 14:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies reported useful data for both the primary and secondary outcomes with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-IND2_x002d_08_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">IND2-08-03</LINK> for the primary outcome. Nine studies enrolled participants with dental pain following extraction of at least one impacted third molar. These individuals are generally in their early 20s and are otherwise fit and healthy, so are clearly not representative of the range of individuals who might need analgesia for acute postoperative pain. There is no a priori reason why the analgesic response in these individuals should differ in any systematic way from a more generalised population, but it is entirely possible that adverse events (gastrointestinal in particular) may be more frequent, intense, or severe in older patients and those with comorbidities. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2001</LINK>) was carried out in patients with pain following uncomplicated orthopaedic surgery. The placebo response in this study was unusually high (21%), which gave reduced efficacy. It is impossible to speculate whether there is a real difference between pain conditions where there is only one study to consider. Differences between different pain models have either not been demonstrable in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>), or have been possible to demonstrate only where there are an abundance of data (for example for ibuprofen) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no data available for lower doses of celecoxib, so conclusions and inferences about the benefit and harm of a lower dose cannot be made.</P>
<P>The lack of availability of three completed randomised trials means that not all of the extant information on celecoxib in acute pain was available for analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-10-18 14:14:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies were of adequate methodological quality, with five scoring 5/5 on the Oxford Quality Scale. Points were lost mainly due to failure to adequately report details of the methods used for randomisation and blinding, and may well result from inadequate reporting rather than inadequate study conduct. The risk of bias assessment indicated that modest group sizes may contribute an unknown level of bias.</P>
<P>All studies administered the medication when pain levels were moderate or severe, ensuring that the study was sensitive to detect a 50% reduction.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-06-05 13:20:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out a comprehensive search for relevant studies, and investigated the potential influence of publication bias by examining the number of participants in trials with zero effect (relative risk of 1.0) needed for the point estimate of the NNT to increase beyond a clinically useful level (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>). In this case, we chose a clinically useful level as 8. For the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief with celecoxib 200 mg, about 640 participants would have to have been involved in unpublished trials with zero treatment effects for the NNT to increase above this threshold. For celecoxib 400 mg, more than twice as many (1500) participants in unpublished trials would be needed. Given that we know of three unpublished but completed studies, one study in Japanese awaiting translation, and two of the included studies did not provide data for the primary outcome, it is possible, although unlikely, that these results could be overturned, although efficacy estimates could be changed.</P>

<P>A small amount of additional data were identified for this update but the conclusions of the previous review are unchanged. Celecoxib at its recommended dosage of 400 mg for acute pain is an effective analgesic, equivalent to ibuprofen 400 mg, but providing a longer duration of pain relief than many traditional NSAIDs. Significantly fewer individuals achieve effective pain relief with celecoxib 200 mg than with celecoxib 400 mg.<BR/>

If appropriate, we will update the review if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions. New searches in November 2016 did not identify any studies that would affect the conclusions of the review. In one single-dose study in dental pain and two multiple-dose studies in bunionectomy, celecoxib 400 mg was used as an active comparator for submicron formulations of diclofenac and indomethacin. Results for celecoxib versus placebo were consistent with the review findings.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3, and complete = 4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual analogue scale (VAS)</HEADING>
<P>Analogue scale: lines with left end labelled 'no relief of pain' and right end labelled 'complete relief of pain', seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms, and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and co-ordination are needed, which can be difficult postoperatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID</HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>VAS TOTPAR</B> and <B>VAS SPID</B> are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.<BR/>
