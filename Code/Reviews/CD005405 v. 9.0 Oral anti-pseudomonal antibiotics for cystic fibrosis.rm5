<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-07-13 10:27:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for evidence that antibiotics that are swallowed can treat <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infections in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Treatment of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>lung infection is very important in managing cystic fibrosis lung disease. If oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics are as effective and safe for treating infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>as intravenous (given into a vein) or nebulised (breathed in as a mist) antibiotics the quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis would improve as it would be easier to administer the drugs administration and would avoid being admitted to hospital.</P>
<P>We looked for trials in which people had equal chances of being treated with oral antibiotics or an alternative treatment for <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>infections. We thought the most important outcomes to find results for were quality of life and lung function. This is an updated version of a previous review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 08 July 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included five trials with 256 participants. Three trials included people experiencing a flare up of disease (171 participants) and two trials looked at long-term therapy (85 participants).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no conclusive evidence to show that oral antibiotics were more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either flare ups of disease or long-term treatment of chronic infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </I>One of the trials with volunteers being treated for a flare up of disease reported significantly better lung function when using ciprofloxacin compared with intravenous treatment; but we did not agree with this finding when we analysed the same data. We did not find any evidence of differences between oral antibiotics and other treatments in terms of adverse events or the development of antibiotic resistance, but we do note that the trials were not designed to detect such differences.</P>
<P>Until the results of large trials are available, people should choose their treatment on a practical basis, basing decisions on any available evidence, their clinical circumstances, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains of the bug and individual preference.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence we found was limited. The trials were very different in terms of design, drugs used, length of treatment and follow up and the outcomes measured. We judged the trials to be at different risks of bias, but we did not think any of them had a low risk of bias from blinding, which might affect the results of subjective outcomes like quality of life.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-14 10:56:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>is the most common bacterial pathogen causing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital. Antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations are usually given intravenously, and for long-term treatment, via a nebuliser. Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics with the same efficacy and safety as intravenous or nebulised antibiotics would benefit people with cystic fibrosis due to ease of treatment and avoidance of hospitalisation. This is an update of a previous review.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-15 14:19:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three trials examining pulmonary exacerbations (171 participants) and two trials examining long-term therapy (85 participants). We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and lung function. The analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments for these outcome measures for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment. One of the included trials reported significantly better lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with ciprofloxacin when compared with intravenous treatment; however, our analysis did not confirm this finding. We found no evidence of difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments regarding adverse events or development of antibiotic resistance, but trials were not adequately powered to detect this. None of the studies had a low risk of bias from blinding which may have an impact particularly on subjective outcomes such as quality of life. The risk of bias for other criteria could not be clearly stated across the studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-14 10:57:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We found no conclusive evidence that an oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic regimen is more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment of chronic infection with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. Until results of adequately-powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available non-randomised evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:57:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-23 09:47:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A consequence of the genetic abnormality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an increased susceptibility to chronic lung infections, resulting in lung damage (<LINK REF="REF-FitzSimmons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzSimmons 1996</LINK>). This lung damage is progressive, ultimately leading to respiratory failure; the principal cause of CF-related mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-FitzSimmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzSimmons 1993</LINK>). By the end of the first decade of life, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>) is the predominant bacterial pathogen causing infection in the lungs of people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). The CFF data registry reports that approximately 65% to 70%  of 18 to 24 year olds have <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-CFF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CFF 2008</LINK>). By 18 years of age, 80% of individuals are colonised with <I>P. aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Rajan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajan 2002</LINK>). In 2009 Millar reported that colonisation rates had remained stable between 1985 and 2005 at 77% to 82% (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 2009</LINK>). Infection with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> seems to precede chronic infection (also known as colonisation) by 6 to 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-West-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2002</LINK>), and once chronic infection is established, there is evidence that mucoid strains of the isolates prevail and in progressively higher density (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nixon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2001</LINK>). Additionally, it has been suggested that there is a relationship between the onset of chronic infection and increased morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parad 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:57:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Appropriate antibiotic therapy against the bacteriological pathogens in the respiratory tract is a vital component in managing CF lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ratjen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratjen 2006</LINK>). Anti-pseudomonal antibiotics are used in three clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>): to attempt eradication of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> at first evidence of infection so as to delay chronic infection that leads to progressive lung damage; as long-term treatment in chronic infection to slow the decline in respiratory function and reduce frequency and morbidity of pulmonary exacerbations; as antibiotic treatment in pulmonary exacerbations to relieve symptoms and restore respiratory function to baseline values (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>For each indication, there is a choice of antibiotics and method of administration (i.e. intravenous (IV), oral, nebulised). For long-term therapy current evidence recommends the use of nebulised antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>). For treating moderate to severe pulmonary exacerbations, IV administration of two different classes of antibiotics is suggested to be most effective (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>). This requires IV access and hospitalisation or home care which are costly and a major inconvenience for the individual with CF.</P>
<P>Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics with the same efficacy and safety as the afore-mentioned methods would improve quality of life of people with CF due to ease of drug administration. Both nebulised and IV treatments require significantly more time compared to oral treatments. Often the administration of IV antibiotics requires hospitalisation rather than home treatment, the subject of another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, the administration of IV antibiotics may cause discomfort and is potentially a source of infection. In 1985, ciprofloxacin, now the most commonly used fluoroquinolone antibiotic for CF, was introduced as an effective oral treatment against <I>P. aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-26 15:19:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to have excellent activity against a variety of micro-organisms found in bronchial sputum of children and adults with CF (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaad-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schaad 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is concern that the wide use of oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistant micro-organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1990</LINK>), but it is not clear how great the risk is of resistant <I>P. aeruginosa</I> developing after treatment with these antibiotics or the real effect of it on the disease process. The adverse effects of these drugs have been well described, for example central nervous system effects, phototoxicity, gastrointestinal effects and joint toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1991</LINK>). Generally pregnancy is a contra-indication to use of these drugs, although it is difficult to know the level of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Schaefer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaefer 1996</LINK>). In most clinical settings there are safe alternatives. Furthermore, while the risk of arthropathy in children is probably not sufficient to avoid use when there is benefit, fluoroquinolone-induced resistance remains a concern (<LINK REF="REF-Schaad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaad 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:54:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The use of oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics to delay the onset of chronic infection with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is covered in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Langton-Hewer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langton Hewer 2014</LINK>). Evidence of the effect of macrolide antibiotics in people with CF and chronic infection with <I>P. aeruginosa </I>is discussed in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 2012</LINK>). We aim to assess oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics for people with CF chronically infected with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, both as a treatment for pulmonary exacerbations and as a long-term treatment in chronic infection.</P>
<P>This is an update of previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Remmington-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remmington 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Remmington-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remmington 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included an arbitrary definition of chronic infection in the '<LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>' section. However, several trials, whilst stating that participants were chronically infected (as described below in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' section) did not completely fulfil our definition. However, we did not feel that it was appropriate to exclude these trials on these grounds. Therefore, we subsequently made a post hoc change to the protocol to enable us to include these trials, i.e. we included trials in which participants were described as chronically infected, even if no further details were given.</P>

<LI>Randomisation ('Low risk' - random number table, computer-generated lists or similar methods; 'Unclear risk' - described as randomised, but no details given; 'High risk' - e.g. alternation, the use of case record numbers, and dates of birth or day of the week).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-10-27 15:12:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For binary outcome measures, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the individual was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. We calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across trials using relative risk where appropriate.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we recorded either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or post-intervention values and standard deviation. If standard errors had been reported (and if it were possible) we planned to convert these to standard deviations. We calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the weighted mean difference. We are aware that some lung function data are skewed and therefore cannot be entered and analysed within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan) 2011</LINK>).

<P>One of the trials included in the review was cross-over in design, but the abstract did not contain any data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1988</LINK>). Ideally when conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over trials we would have liked to use the inverse variance methods that are recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). However, due to restrictions on the data that were available from the included trial, the only method that we have been able to use was to treat the cross-over trial as if it was a parallel trial (assuming a correlation of zero as the most conservative estimate). Elbourne says that this approach produces conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant appears in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups are not independent.</P>

<P>When sufficient trials are included in the review, we plan to perform a sensitivity analysis based on the methodological quality of the trials, including and excluding quasi-randomized trials. We plan to assess the degree of heterogeneity between trials using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This measure describes the percentage of total variation across studies that are due to heterogeneity rather than by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The values of I<SUP>2</SUP> lie between 0% and 100%, and a simplified categorization of heterogeneity that we plan to use is of low (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 25%), moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 50%), and high (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 75%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If we find significant heterogeneity (over 50%), we will investigate the possible causes further by performing subgroup analyses based on the methodological quality of the included trials and the condition of the individuals (i.e. severity of disease, duration and type of treatment e.g. single or combined treatment). If no significant heterogeneity is identified, we will compute pooled estimates of the treatment effect for each outcome under a fixed effect model.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:46:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Current standard treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is intravenous administration of two different classes of antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>). Standard long-term treatment is to use nebulised antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>). There may be significant advantages of oral treatment for people with CF compared to an intravenous (IV) or inhaled drug regimen. We identified five trials which were eligible for inclusion in the review; three trials of treatment of pulmonary exacerbations and two trials of long-term treatment for chronic infection of the respiratory tract.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:06:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In summary, we were unable to find sufficient evidence of benefits and harms to provide guidance on the use of an oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic regimen (alone or in combination with another therapy) in treating a pulmonary exacerbation. Likewise, we were unable to present any conclusive evidence to show that an oral antibiotic regimen (alone or in combination with another therapy) is more or less effective than any other drug regimen for long-term treatment of chronic infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>).</P>
<P>No sufficient data were identified to validate concerns surrounding the emergence of antibiotic resistance as a result of widespread and long-term use of oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. Similarly, no differences in frequency or severity of adverse effects of antibiotics were found. However, the trials were not adequately powered to detect these differences and may not have been of sufficient duration to detect long-term adverse events.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:10:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>All of the trials were published over 15 years ago and did not always report outcome measures which clinicians and consumers currently perceive to be important. The trials were very heterogeneous in terms of design, drugs used, outcomes measured and duration of treatment and follow up. We used an arbitrary definition of chronic infection (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2004</LINK>); however, several trials, whilst stating that participants were chronically infected did not define this term clearly and consistently. After correspondence with several authors to clarify definitions of chronic infection, we were able to make a <I>post hoc</I> change to the review and include trials which we initially thought would be excluded. Furthermore, inconsistencies in expression of results and statistical reporting (e.g. different measures of lung function reported in a variety of ways) made meta-analysis impossible in most cases. We would need to collect individual patient data from the trial authors to clarify these issues; however, given the age of the trials it is unlikely that this would be possible. It was disappointing that only four trials presented data which we were able to analyse. Most of the outcome measures included in the data tables consisted of data from only one or two trials. An insufficient number of trials and lack of data presented within the included trials meant we were unable to use sensitivity and subgroup analyses to examine for effects of methodological quality of trials, the condition of the individuals (i.e. severity of disease), duration of treatment or type of treatment (e.g. single or combined treatment).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:46:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and clinical improvement. In our analysis, we unable to present any significant results for these outcome measures for any of the comparisons, either for exacerbations or maintenance treatment. However, in her primary paper Hodson reported significant results for lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with oral ciprofloxacin compared to a combination of IV azlocillin and gentamicin (<LINK REF="STD-Hodson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hodson 1987</LINK>). The consensus for standard treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation is the use of IV antibiotics, but we were unable to identify any evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for this. For long-term maintenance treatment, standard care consists of nebulised antibiotics; we were unable to demonstrate any evidence from RCTs that this is more effective than oral treatment.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:47:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:46:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We found no evidence from RCTs that oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, alone or in combination with another therapy, are any more or less effective in treating acute pulmonary infectious exacerbations or for long-term treatment of chronic infection in people with CF than other therapies. Until results of adequately powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available non-RCT evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-27 16:47:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treatment of lung infection in people with CF who have chronic <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection is an important question for people with CF. The evidence from available RCTs is insufficient to answer the question. Unfortunately, as far as we are aware, there have been no RCTs of this intervention since 1998, and this highlights the need for further research. Future trials should be designed to adequately compare oral treatment with current standard therapies for both acute pulmonary exacerbations and long-term treatment of chronic infection. This review gives limited evidence of the frequency and variance of outcome measures to plan sample size. In order to enable future pooling of data, trial authors should endeavour to use standard methods and definitions to report on outcomes which are important to people with CF and their carers, such as quality of life, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic resistance; all of which are reasonably widely accepted in CF literature.</P>

In all participants IV therapy was supplemented by twice daily inhalation of amikacin (500 mg in 2 ml) administered using a nebuliser. Patients who responded to hospital treatment were randomised to a 3-month period of outpatient therapy with oral ciprofloxacin (30 mg/kg/day) either alone or in combination with supplemental amikacin inhalation therapy (500 mg/kg/day). CPX was given in 2 doses to a maximum dose of 1.5 g/day. Physiotherapy tds when participants were in hospital and bd thereafter.

One of the standard lung function measurements, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, is not mentioned and it is not clear if this was not measured at each assessment or if the authors have selectively reported this outcome.</P>
