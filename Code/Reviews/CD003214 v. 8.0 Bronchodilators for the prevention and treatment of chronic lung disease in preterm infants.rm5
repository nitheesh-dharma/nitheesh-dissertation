<P>
<B>Review question: </B>What are the effects of bronchodilators on mortality and other complications of preterm birth in infants at risk for or having chronic lung disease (CLD)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Chronic lung disease is common in babies born before 34 weeks' gestation. Bronchodilators are drugs that cause widening of the air passages in the lungs. They have been used for chronic lung disease because of their potential effect of dilating small airways in babies born preterm. Bronchodilators can be inhaled, taken by mouth (a puffer) or injection or received through a nebuliser with a pressurised aerosol.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials. We included in the analyses two studies that reported on 225 infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding resources: </B>We did not identify funding by industry for any trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>This review of trials found too little evidence to show positive or negative effects of bronchodilators for prevention of chronic lung disease. More research is needed. We found no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for treatment of CLD.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence: </B>The quality of the evidence was moderate for one included trial and low for the other.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-24 04:52:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD) occurs frequently in preterm infants. Bronchodilators have the potential effect of dilating small airways with muscle hypertrophy. Increased compliance and tidal volume and decreased pulmonary resistance have been documented with the use of bronchodilators in infants with CLD. Therefore, bronchodilators might have a role in the prevention and treatment of CLD.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-24 05:09:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 2016 March 7, we used the standard strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1966), Embase (from 1980) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; from 1982). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. We applied no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-24 05:53:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving preterm infants were eligible for inclusion. Initiation of bronchodilator therapy for prevention of CLD had to occur within two weeks of birth. Treatment of patients with CLD had to be initiated before discharge from the neonatal unit. The intervention had to include administration of a bronchodilator by nebulisation, by metered dose inhaler (with or without a spacer device) or by intravenous or oral administration versus placebo or no intervention. Eligible studies had to include at least one of the following predefined clinical outcomes: mortality, CLD, number of days on oxygen, number of days on ventilator, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), pneumothorax, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) of any grade, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis and adverse effects of bronchodilators.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-24 05:53:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard method described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="Higgins 2011">Higgins 2011</A>). Two review authors extracted and assessed all data provided by each study. We reported risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-25 05:46:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we identified one new randomised controlled trial investigating effects of bronchodilators in preterm infants. This study, which enrolled 73 infants but reported on 52 infants, examined prevention of CLD with the use of aminophylline. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was very low. One previously included study enrolled 173 infants to look at prevention of CLD with the use of salbutamol. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was moderate. We found no eligible trial that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for treatment of individuals with CLD. Prophylaxis with salbutamol led to no statistically significant differences in mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.31; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11) nor in CLD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17). Results showed no statistically significant differences in other complications associated with CLD nor in preterm birth. Investigators in this study did not comment on side effects due to salbutamol. Prophylaxis with aminophylline led to a significant reduction in CLD at 28 days of life (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; RD -0.35, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.13; NNTB 3, 95% CI 2 to 8) and no significant difference in mortality (RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.33 to 26.99; RD 0.08, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.22), along with a significantly shorter dependency on supplementary oxygen in the aminophylline group compared with the no treatment group (MD -17.75 days, 95% CI -27.56 to -7.94). Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses, as each meta-analysis included only one study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-24 06:05:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data are insufficient for reliable assessment of the use of salbutamol for prevention of CLD. One trial of poor quality reported a reduction in the incidence of CLD and shorter duration of supplementary oxygen with prophylactic aminophylline, but these results must be interpreted with caution. Additional clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of bronchodilator agents in prophylaxis or treatment of CLD. Researchers studying the effects of bronchodilators in preterm infants should include relevant clinical outcomes in addition to pulmonary mechanical outcomes. We identified no trials that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for treatment of CLD.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-25 05:48:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD), defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age with compatible chest x-rays, is a pulmonary disorder that occurs frequently in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shennan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shennan 1988</LINK>). It is the consequence of unresolved or abnormally repaired lung damage, and its multi-factorial aetiology has been detailed extensively by previous authors. This includes exposure to high oxygen concentration, volume-derived trauma, barotrauma, sepsis and inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paita-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paita 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 1995</LINK>). Over past decades, the survival rate of very low birth weight infants has increased, and the prevalence of CLD remains high (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1992</LINK>). Incidence varies depending on the population studied, the diagnostic criteria used and variations between clinical management approaches reported at study centres (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shennan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shennan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>). CLD may be associated with chronic respiratory difficulties, prolonged and recurrent hospitalisation, growth restriction and death (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>). Administration of antenatal corticosteroids to mothers likely to give birth preterm reduces neonatal mortality and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) but does not reduce the incidence of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2001</LINK>). Administration of prophylactic natural surfactant extract does not reduce the incidence of CLD but reduces the combined outcome of death or CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-25 05:50:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchodilators may be delivered orally, intravenously or by nebuliser or pressurised aerosol with or without a spacer device. With nebulisation or aerosol, only 0.22% to 1.3% of the dose will reach the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Grigg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>). Aerosol tends to be deposited in the central lung region rather than at the periphery (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>). Humidification of the gas reduces lower respiratory tract deposition of aerosol (<LINK REF="REF-Diot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diot 1995</LINK>). Addition of a spacer device between the nebuliser and the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1995</LINK>) and synchronising nebulisation with inspiratory airflow (<LINK REF="REF-Diot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diot 1995</LINK>) increase deposition. Variability in lung deposition among individuals has been considerable (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>). All of these factors serve to modify therapeutic effects.</P>
<P>Numerous bronchodilators are available. Inhaled bronchodilators include non-specific beta-adrenergic agents, such as isoproterenol and isoetharine, and specific beta-adrenergic agents, such as albuterol, metaproterenol, terbutaline and isoetharine. Side effects of beta agonists include hypokalaemia, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, tremor, hypertension and hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 2000</LINK>). Inhaled anticholinergic agents include atropine and ipratropium. Atropine results in more side effects when compared with ipratropium, as the latter is poorly absorbed. Side effects of inhaled anticholinergic agents include tachycardia, decreased gastrointestinal motility, tremor and drying of respiratory secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1990</LINK>). Systemic bronchodilators include the methylxanthines - caffeine and theophylline - which act by blockage of adenosine receptors. Reported side effects include vomiting, diarrhoea, tachycardia, hypertension and agitation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above.

<LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK>, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind trial, enrolled 173 infants needing ventilatory support from six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in France.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To investigate the potential efficacy of inhaled beclomethasone, salbutamol or their combination for preventing CLD in ventilator-dependent preterm neonates.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Population: Infants with respiratory distress syndrome and gestational age of less than 31 weeks' PMA were eligible for the study if they required ventilatory support on the 10th postnatal day (re-assessed daily between the 7th and 10th days). The study did not include babies with major malformations, sepsis or current bronchopulmonary infection and those treated with corticosteroids or bronchodilators.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention: Investigators provided interventions to four treatment groups: placebo + placebo (P + P), placebo + salbutamol (P + S), placebo + beclomethasone (P + B) and salbutamol + beclomethasone (S + B). Salbutamol was given at a dose of 200 micrograms every four hours (1200 micrograms/d) via metered dose inhaler and spacer device. Beclomethasone was given at a dose of 250 micrograms via metered dose inhaler and spacer device. Researchers initiated treatment on the 10th or 11th postnatal day and continued treatment for 28 days, tapering the dose off over eight days.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Outcomes: Primary outcomes were mortality and CLD characterised at 28 days of life on the basis of clinical (oxygen dependency) and radiographic criteria. Secondary outcomes were duration of ventilatory support, duration of oxygen supplementation, ventilatory index (product of oxygen tension and mean airway pressure) measured every week until extubation, pulmonary complications (pneumothorax, interstitial emphysema), sepsis, mandatory intravenous corticosteroid treatment according to usual practice at each centre and episodes of bronchospasm treated with intravenous bronchodilators.

<UL>
<LI>Objective: To assess the safety and preventive effects of aminophylline in terms of the incidence of CLD in very preterm infants.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Population: Infants were born preterm with birth weight of 1200 grams or less. The study did not include infants who had major congenital anomalies, asphyxia, occurrence of apnoea and need for mechanical ventilation in the first 24 hours after birth, congenital cyanotic heart disease, small for gestational age intrauterine growth and sepsis in the first 10 days after birth.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention: For the aminophylline group (A), after consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the preterm neonate with birth weight of 1200 grams or less, investigators began treatment with 5 mg/kg of aminophylline, given as a loading dose parenterally; this was followed by 1.5 mg/kg given as a maintenance dose each eight hours for the first 10 days of life. In the control group (C), after consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the premature neonate with birth weight of 1200 grams or less, investigators administered no aminophylline during the first 10 days of life.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Outcomes: Primary and secondary outcomes included duration of dependency on oxygen and incidence of CLD. Both groups made decisions regarding CLD uniformly. Neonates were considered as having CLD/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) if they had been oxygen dependent for at least 28 days after birth, and if the severity of CLD was judged according to preset criteria. Aminophylline side effects (tachycardia,hypertension) and mortality were recorded as other secondary outcomes.</LI>

<P>For the update conducted in March 2016, review authors identified two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Armanian-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Armanian 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almaraz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almaraz 2012</LINK>). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Almaraz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almaraz 2012</LINK>, as the study was published only in abstract format. Investigators did not report the age of infants at the time of treatment for severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. They did report the following outcomes: decreased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 0.20; lung liquid interleukin (IL)-1&#946;, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;).</P>
<P>For the update conducted in April 2012, review authors identified four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Khalaf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Khalaf 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fayon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fayon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2009</LINK>). However, they excluded these trials as all reported on pulmonary mechanical outcomes and provided no information on clinical outcomes of interest for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK> examined prevention of chronic lung disease (CLD). No studies assessed important clinical outcomes of treatment for CLD.

However, they did not examine our primary and secondary clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK> showed no evidence that salbutamol reduced mortality or CLD at 28 days of life in preterm infants at risk of developing CLD. This study did not report outcomes for CLD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, which is generally regarded as the more important outcome with regards to CLD. Study authors did not demonstrate earlier weaning from respiratory support with salbutamol and did not report the duration of oxygen supplementation. Researchers demonstrated that salbutamol does not affect the need for intravenous dexamethasone or sepsis compared with placebo. Use of dexamethasone may have varied between the six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) involved in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK> did not comment on adverse effects of salbutamol.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK> found no significant differences in outcomes upon comparing salbutamol with placebo. Salbutamol showed no evidence of effect in <LINK REF="STD-Denjean-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Denjean 1998</LINK>; several reasons may explain this. The study did not assess drug deposition, which is known to change the therapeutic effect of the drug. The amount of drug delivered to the lungs varied with the route of administration. The mode of delivery used may have led to delivery of insufficient drug to the lungs. The pathophysiology of CLD is multi-factorial. Mechanisms besides muscle hypertrophy in small airways may explain why salbutamol showed no evidence of effect for prevention of CLD.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Armanian-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Armanian 2014</LINK> found that aminophylline reduced CLD at 28 days in preterm infants at risk of developing CLD and reduced the duration of dependency on supplementary oxygen but found no differences in mortality. Study authors reported no side effects of aminophylline. However, this study was of overall poor methodological quality, and these outcomes should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Review authors identified no trials that studied use of bronchodilator therapy for treatment of CLD.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-25 06:18:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authors were surprised at the paucity of trials that assessed clinical outcomes of bronchodilators in CLD. We found no randomised controlled trials in an extensive search of the literature on use of bronchodilators in the treatment of CLD. Two trials assessed the effectiveness of two different bronchodilators (aminophylline and salbutamol); as interventions differed, we could not combine study results in meta-analyses. Aminophylline may have beneficial effects in prevention of CLD, but the poor quality of the one small included trial prevents application of findings to clinical practice.</P>

<P>Results of this systematic review show no current evidence for the use of salbutamol or aminophylline for prevention of CLD. We were unable to address the question of whether bronchodilators are useful in the treatment of CLD. Future use of bronchodilators in preterm infants should occur in the scenario of placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-25 06:22:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In light of the paucity of clinical trials available for inclusion in this systematic review, future research should be directed towards addressing the question of whether bronchodilators have a preventive role in the following: treatment of preterm infants at risk of CLD to reduce mortality, CLD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, duration of ventilatory support, duration of oxygen supplementation and long-term outcomes (to 18 months' corrected gestational age). Future studies should be conducted to evaluate whether bronchodilators have a role in the treatment of preterm infants with established CLD to reduce mortality, duration of ventilatory support or duration of oxygen supplementation. It is important that researchers assess whether this occurs without undue side effects, and that they assess clinical outcomes beyond short-term pulmonary function. A wide variety of bronchodilators are available, and studies included in this review assessed only salbutamol and aminophylline. Future research should examine use of different bronchodilator drugs, different drug dosages and different modes of delivery, and should assess drug deposition.</P>

<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table.<BR/>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>b. high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;<BR/>b. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel; and<BR/>c. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>5.Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (when it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b. high risk (when not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a. low risk;<BR/>b. high risk; or<BR/>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<BR/>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
