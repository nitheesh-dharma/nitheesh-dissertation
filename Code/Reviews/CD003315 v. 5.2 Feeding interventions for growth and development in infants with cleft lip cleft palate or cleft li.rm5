<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-19 09:19:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft.</P>
<P>This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood.</P>
<P>Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon-feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon-feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-12-13 15:53:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Littlewood">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 27 October 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 27 October 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 27 October 2010), PsycINFO via OVID (1950 to 27 October 2010) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 27 October 2010). Attempts were made to identify both unpublished and ongoing studies. There was no restriction with regard to language of publication.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of feeding interventions for babies born with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate up to the age of 6 months (from term).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were assessed for relevance independently and in duplicate. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were data extracted and assessed for validity independently by each member of the review team. Authors were contacted for clarification or missing information whenever possible. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 09:18:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five RCTs with a total of 292 babies, were included in the review. Comparisons made within the RCTs were squeezable versus rigid feeding bottles (two studies), breastfeeding versus spoon-feeding (one study) and maxillary plate versus no plate (two studies). No statistically significant differences were shown for any of the primary outcomes when comparing bottle types, although squeezable bottles were less likely to require modification. No difference was shown for infants fitted with a maxillary plate compared to no plate. However, there was some evidence of an effect on weight at 6 weeks post-surgery in favour of breastfeeding when compared to spoon-feeding (mean difference 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.74).</P>

<P>Squeezable bottles appear easier to use than rigid feeding bottles for babies born with clefts of the lip and/or palate, however, there is no evidence of a difference in growth outcomes between the bottle types. There is weak evidence that breastfeeding is better than spoon-feeding following surgery for cleft. There was no evidence to suggest that maxillary plates assist growth in babies with clefts of the palate. No evidence was found to assess the use of any types of maternal advice and/or support for these babies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the Condition</HEADING>
<P>Cleft lip and cleft palate are common birth defects, between them affecting about one baby of every 700 born. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CLAPA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CLAPA 2001</LINK>) define cleft lip as "an opening in the upper lip between the mouth and the nose... it can range from a slight notch in the coloured portion of the lip to complete separation in one or both sides of the lip extending up and into the nose". They explain cleft palate as occurring when "the roof of the mouth is not joined completely....[this can] range from just an opening at the back of the soft palate to a nearly complete separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate)". These two conditions may arise early in pregnancy whilst an unborn baby is developing, and may occur independently or together (in cleft lip and palate). The cleft may be on one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral).</P>
<P>A cleft lip may cause a problem in creating a seal around the nipple, but closure can still generally be obtained. However, a cleft palate prevents the baby from creating the negative pressure necessary to feed and may also lead to breathing problems during feeding. At the very least this lengthens feeding times considerably. Clefting of the hard palate also limits the normal use of the tongue to compress the nipple (<LINK REF="REF-Shprintzen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shprintzen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of studies have examined birthweight in children born with cleft lip and/or palate (<LINK REF="REF-Avedian-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avedian 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Becker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1998</LINK>). The results vary but suggest that babies with cleft lip and palate are lighter and smaller than babies without a cleft. Variation in results may be due to confounding factors such as maternal age or parity (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1998</LINK>) or other social factors. One study reports data by type of orofacial cleft and found that infants with an isolated cleft lip were no lighter than babies without a cleft. However, those infants born with either a cleft palate or a cleft lip and palate were found to be lighter (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1983</LINK> studied Danish boys aged 6 to 20 years with clefts and compared them with a control group, finding delayed skeletal maturity in boys with clefts over the whole period. <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1988</LINK> found that weight gain per week was lower in neonates with clefts than without. More recently <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK> found that clefting was associated with significant growth faltering in early infancy, but that children attained their expected weight and height by about 2 years of age. Clefting has also been associated with increased risks of failure to thrive (<LINK REF="REF-Marcovitch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcovitch 1994</LINK>) and severe dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-Livingstone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingstone 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There appear to be additional developmental delays in some children with cleft lip and/or palate, which may also be linked to nutritional status early in life. <LINK REF="REF-Jocelyn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jocelyn 1996</LINK> found that children with a cleft had significantly lower scores on tests of cognition, comprehension and expressive language abilities than matched control children at 12 and 24 months. <LINK REF="REF-Neiman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neiman 1997</LINK> found that at 36 months toddlers with a cleft showed significantly lower developmental performance in fine motor, gross motor and expressive language skills compared with toddlers without a cleft. Maternal attachment may also be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Speltz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speltz 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the Intervention</HEADING>
<P>In an effort to combat reduced weight for height, a variety of advice and devices are recommended to aid the feeding of babies born with a cleft. These include a variety of modified bottles and teats (<LINK REF="REF-Clarren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CLAPA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CLAPA 2001</LINK>), measures to supplement breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Clarren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wide-Smiles-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wide Smiles 2001</LINK>), obturating plates (<LINK REF="REF-Balluff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balluff 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nagda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagda 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kogo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kogo 1997</LINK>) and advice or training to parents (<LINK REF="REF-Richard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Danner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danner 1992</LINK>). An obturating plate is an acrylic appliance placed over the gums of the babies upper jaw so that the cleft between the mouth and nose is covered. They may be passive, or occasionally are used to adjust the relationship between the jaw segments. The methods suggested vary with cleft type and severity (<LINK REF="REF-Clarren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarren 1987</LINK>), from healthcare centre to healthcare centre (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>), as well as preoperatively and postoperatively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Feeding of the baby is an immediate concern because the lip and/or palate are affected, and there is evidence of a delay in growth of children born with clefts as compared to those without clefting. This review aimed to assess the effects of these feeding interventions for babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development and parental satisfaction. Suitable feeding interventions may help to prevent developmental delay in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We used the two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other issues&#8217;). Each domain includes one or more specific entries in a &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicates low risk of bias, &#8216;No&#8217; indicates high risk of bias, and &#8216;Unclear&#8217; indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias are each addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. The risk of bias assessment was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process.</P>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories.</P>

<P>A risk of bias table was completed for each included study and results will also be presented graphically (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further quality assessment was carried out to assess other potential threats to validity, including: definition of exclusion/inclusion criteria, adequate definition of success criteria and comparability of control and treatment groups at entry. It was planned that a pilot test of the quality assessment criteria would be conducted using several articles, however, only one study was used for pilot testing due to the paucity of included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was to be expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>Where necessary the authors of the included studies were contacted to provide missing or incomplete data. Sensitivity analyses were to be undertaken to examine the effect of randomisation, allocation concealment and blind outcome assessment on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined if data had allowed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by examining the types of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study. Only if there were studies of similar comparisons, reporting the same outcome measures, was meta-analysis attempted. Risk ratios were to be combined for dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences for continuous data, using a random-effects model. The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials were assessed by means of Cochran's test for significant statistical heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Where possible meta-analyses were undertaken to compare studies with the same outcomes. These included studies assessing bottle feeding approaches, comparisons of breast and spoon feeding and the use of maxillary plates prior to surgery. A fixed-effect approach was employed.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were to be undertaken to compare: results for cleft lip only (pre- and post-closure), cleft palate only (pre- and post-closure) and cleft lip and palate. However, insufficient data were available for subgroup analyses.</P>

The studies were carried out in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>), India (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>), the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>) and the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Three studies were excluded. Two studies did not contain measures of growth data. The remaining study assessed the use of bottle feeding after cleft repair on infants older than 6 months of age at baseline (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>The studies included babies with cleft lip only (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>), cleft palate or cleft lip and palate (prior to closure) (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>), babies with clefts of lip, palate or lip and palate (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>) or babies with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>). Four studies clearly stated that babies with major congenital anomalies or recognised medical conditions were excluded from the study (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). However it must be noted that some congenital abnormalities associated with cleft that can affect growth may be difficult to detect, making accurate exclusion of participants difficult. Therefore, the age of the included babies ranged from birth (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>) up to 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>). The number of babies included in the studies ranged from 37 (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>) to 101 (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared bottle type (squeezable versus rigid) (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>), with all mothers receiving feeding advice. In the trial by Brine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>) an intraoral maxillary obturator was fitted for infants with complete cleft lip and palate. Two further trials compared the use of a passive, acrylic plate designed to cover the hard palate and the alveolar segments, with no plate (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). The fifth study compared post-surgical breastfeeding or spoon-feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>). Follow up of the mother-infant pairs ranged from 7 to 13 months (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>) up to 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All trials provided measures of weight (kg). Head circumference and/or length were reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). Brine et al also recorded tricep and subscapular skinfold measurements and mid-arm circumference (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>). Prahl et al reported mean weight-for-length, length-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores (mean weight and length data were supplied separately by the author) (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Measurements were recorded up to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>) and 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>) in three studies. Darzi and colleagues only presented data for 3 and 6 weeks post-surgery, despite the trial having a 7 to 13 month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the anthropometric measurements undertaken, energy and protein intakes were recorded from food records (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>), physiological measures of feeding were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>) and parental satisfaction and reliability of feeding methods reported (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were coded as 'Yes' indicating low risk of bias with regard to the method used to generate the randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). In the earlier of these studies, randomisation was undertaken using drawing of lots (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>). In the second trial participants were initially stratified into three groups according to the extent of palatal cleft (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>). A statistician constructed a separate randomisation list for each group using the method of randomised permuted blocks with a block size of four. A computerised balanced allocation was used to randomise babies in the third trial in order to minimise potential imbalances between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>). The fourth trial used a computerised allocation using minimisation procedure to reduce the potential differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>) was coded as 'Unclear' as insufficient data were presented in the study.</P>

<P>Three trials were coded as 'Yes' for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). One study used sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>) and the other two used a computer program (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). The two remaining studies were coded as 'Unclear' (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>It was not possible for the parents of the babies included in the studies to be blind to intervention group. Only one trial used blind outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>). For the remaining trials, blind outcome assessment was either 'Unclear' (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>) or not undertaken (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>The greatest number of reported drop outs occurred in the study by Masarei et al (<LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). The study initially randomised 50 babies: 34 with unilateral cleft lip and palate and 16 with isolated cleft palate. One baby was withdrawn from the study due to medical complications. Twelve-month weight, height and head circumference data were not available for 18 babies. Five babies' data were missing from the maxillary plate group (four unilateral cleft lip and palate and one isolated cleft palate), whilst 13 withdrew from the control group (nine unilateral cleft lip and plate and four isolated cleft lip). Within the maxillary plate group, two babies were not using the plate daily (one due to anxiety about sleeping infant on his back, one felt the plate did not fit appropriately). Of these one family had ceased to use the plate by 3-month follow-up (sleep anxiety), whereas the other family had starting using the plate again. One other family abandoned using the plate by 3 months (did not fit appropriately) and a final mother did not bring her infant to the 3-month assessment. No information is provided on the remaining drop outs, except that only 14 out of 25 infants within the maxillary plate group wore it for the full 6 months.</P>
<P>In the study by Brine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>), six mother/baby pairs withdrew (four transferred to another facility; one was dissatisfied with treatment assignment; one failed to keep appointment), but it is unclear which groups these drop outs had initially been allocated to. Data for these mother/baby pairs were not included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Shaw et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>) initially randomised 101 babies. However, two babies were excluded from the study analysis due to severe developmental delay and phenylketonuria. Both babies had been randomised to be fed using a rigid bottle. Six mother/baby pairs randomised to the rigid bottle group transferred to the squeezable bottle due to difficulties in feeding. All mother/baby pairs were analysed according to the group to which they were initially allocated.</P>
<P>Forty babies, out of an initial 54, had sufficient recorded anthropometric measurements for evaluation in the trial by Prahl et al (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>). Data was handled according to the intention-to-treat principle, as described in their earlier 2001 paper (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no drop outs in the fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>Three of the studies reported all three appropriate outcome measures - length, weight, height and head circumference (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). The fourth study reported both weight and length, but no head circumference (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>). Darzi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>) did not report length or head circumference as outcome measures.</P>
<P>In the study by Masarei et al (<LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>), the paper reports data at 3 months of age and again at 12 months. However, no height, weight or head circumference measures were reported at 6 months of age, prior to surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>All studies included in the review included an appropriate period of follow-up from initial and all had comparable baseline data on all outcome measures between intervention groups at baseline.</P>
<P>In the study by Masarei et al (<LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>), the treatment of the maxillary plate group and the non-maxillary group differed in terms of number of orthodontic check up and number of visits to the clinic. This raises issues around the comparability of the two groups at 3 and 12-month follow-up on factors other than the wearing of a maxillary plate. There was also a problem with compliance within the maxillary plate condition, with many infants not wearing the plate for the full 6-month period of the study.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 10:04:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three main comparisons were identified.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Squeezable versus rigid feeding bottles</HEADING>
<P>Two studies, providing data on 130 babies at follow-up, compared bottle types (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>). Both studies reported weight (kg), length (cm) and head circumference (cm) (data presented in graph form only for <LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>). The larger and higher quality of the two studies provided evidence of a statistically significant benefit to head circumference at greater than 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>). However, pooled analysis showed no difference between the two bottle types for weight (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), height (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) or head circumference (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) at any time point.</P>
<P>Quality of life and adverse events were reported in the study by Shaw et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>) in terms of crying, feeding, sleeping and playing time, measured using a 24-hour parental log. No statistically significant differences between bottle type were shown for any of these outcomes. The number of times a bottle had to be modified by the health visitor (by increasing the number of holes in the teat, for example) was 25/52 (48%) for the rigid bottles compared to 4/49 (8%) for the squeezable bottles (<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>) (P &lt; 0.05). Six babies randomised to the rigid bottle were transferred to the squeezable bottle due to difficulties in feeding, despite modifications to the original bottle.</P>
<P>Brine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>) also reported mean energy and protein intakes. A difference was shown for protein intakes at 3 and 6 months, in favour of the squeezable bottle (P &lt; 0.05). However, this may have been due to four infants in this group receiving a high protein soy-based formula rather than the standard formula.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Breastfeeding versus spoon-feeding</HEADING>
<P>One study, providing data on 40 babies, compared the effectiveness of breastfeeding babies with cleft lips, post-surgery, with spoon-feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>). A difference was shown in terms of weight (kg) at 6-weeks post-surgery, in favour of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), mean difference 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.74). The age at the time of surgery ranged between 3 to 6 months, with a mean age of 4.35 months for the breast-fed group and 4.5 months for the spoon-fed group. With regard to duration of hospital stay, no statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups.</P>
<P>It was noted within the study that spoon-fed infants required analgesia/sedation and intravenous fluids more often and for longer periods than breast-fed infants, although data for this were not provided. Adverse events reported were one wound dehiscence and one hypertrophy of the lip scar. Both events occurred in babies being spoon-fed.</P>
<P>The average total cost of hospitalisation was 98 Indian rupees in the breast-fed group and 156 Indian rupees in the spoon-fed group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The increase in cost was due to the additional analgesia/sedation and the cost of commercial feeds.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: Maxillary plate versus no maxillary plate</HEADING>
<P>Two studies, providing data on 26 babies at follow-up, compared the effectiveness of a passive maxillary plate, worn 24 hours a day until surgical closure of soft palate, to no plate (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials reported weight-for-length, length-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores, which enable data from all babies, at all follow-up appointments, to be taken into account. No statistically significant differences in the scores obtained from each group were shown. However, the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK> study reported that the mean z-scores of the children included in the trial did differ significantly from the reference population used to calculate the scores, with the infants with a unilateral cleft being lighter and shorter throughout their first year of life.</P>
<P>The z-scores presented in these papers have not been displayed graphically in this review in order to make the results from the included trials more comparable. However, it is acknowledged that the presentation of z-scores is preferable when expressing child growth status (<LINK REF="REF-Gorstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorstein 1994</LINK>). Mean weight and length at different time points (2 months (54 to 67 days), 6 months (169 to 197 days), 12 months (235 to 379 days)) were calculated based on raw data provided by the authors. The numbers of babies included in the analyses were low as we analysed babies coming for follow-up at specific ages, but many babies did not have follow-up at these times points. A statistically significant difference in weight (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), in favour of the plate, was seen at 6 months (169 to 187 days) in only 28 of the babies, however, this difference was not observed at any other time point. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups with regard to length (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) or head circumference (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>This review found some evidence that breastfeeding, when compared to spoon-feeding, may improve weight gain in babies following surgery for cleft lip. However, it should be noted that the outcome measurements were only reported for up to 6 weeks post-surgery. The study was clearly randomised and all babies were followed to 6 weeks, but allocation concealment and blinding of the outcome assessor were unclear, so the results may have been biased.</P>
<P>No trials were identified that examined the effect of additional maternal support or advice during breastfeeding (or bottle-feeding). The World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, however, rates of breastfeeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate are low (<LINK REF="REF-Trenouth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trenouth 1996</LINK>). Given the recognised health benefits of breast milk mothers should not be discouraged from breastfeeding, although they should be made aware of the potential difficulties and be provided with adequate support. If direct breastfeeding is not possible, mothers may wish to feed their baby with expressed breast milk. Further studies of the most appropriate support and advice for mothers wishing to feed their baby with breast milk are required.</P>
<P>Although there is no consistent evidence to support or refute the use of squeezable feeding bottles over rigid feeding bottles for growth or development outcomes, the unreliability of a bottle type (determined by the number of times a bottle needed to be modified by the health visitor) was significantly greater for the rigid bottles. The squeezable bottles may not enhance (or impair) growth and development, but may be easier to use for the feeding of babies born with cleft conditions. There was no evidence to suggest that the use of maxillary plates improved growth outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Feeding infants with cleft conditions is of immediate concern to both the clinician and parent in the newborn period (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>). Despite this, there is little research evidence with regard to the most effective feeding intervention for such babies on growth, development and parental satisfaction. Surveys of parents of children born with a cleft lip and/or palate report some dissatisfaction with the level of care and information they receive regarding feeding, both in hospital and on discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Trenouth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trenouth 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lack of information provided to the parents may reflect the lack of data currently available describing the nature of the problem of feeding newborn babies with a cleft lip and/or palate. Only two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kogo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kogo 1997</LINK>) have measured intraoral negative pressure, which is thought to be absent or at least partially diminished when a cleft palate occurs. Other studies have alluded to altered tongue positions during swallowing (<LINK REF="REF-Campo_x002d_Paysaa-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campo-Paysaa 1987</LINK>) and altered oro-pharyngeal stages of swallowing (<LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). Most papers simply comment on behavioural sequelae such as coughing, choking, gagging, nasal regurgitation, etc (<LINK REF="REF-Styer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Styer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarren-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, accurate prevalence figures for feeding problems are difficult to obtain from the literature because there has been no prospective, longitudinal population study of the extent of the problem. We do know that Jones (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1982</LINK>) found that 25% of a cohort of non-syndromic infants with cleft lip, cleft palate and combined cleft lip and palate had poor feeding, and Spriesterbach (<LINK REF="REF-Spriestersbach-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spriestersbach 1973</LINK>) reported that 73% of infants with cleft palate had feeding problems. Epidemiological studies which can yield information about the basis and nature of feeding problems, prevalence and also risk factors (cleft type, cleft size, comorbidity, maternal education, socio-economic status, etc) may be beneficial.</P>
<P>Intervention techniques have arisen without a sound foundation. For example, we do not yet fully understand:<BR/>(a) how the structural anomaly affects the mechanics and function of sucking;<BR/>(b) how and why some infants are able to compensate/alter their sucking patterns and obtain sufficient nutrients;<BR/>(c) whether there are long term effects on feeding even after cleft repair, or whether feeding returns to normal (the belief that everything returns to normal ignores the significant motor learning that has taken place regarding sucking and swallowing over many months).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the research literature on feeding interventions is based on uncontrolled studies, expert opinion, or non-systematic review articles. To date, only five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published which investigate feeding interventions for newborns and infants under 6 months with cleft conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Brine-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Brine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darzi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darzi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). Methodological quality of these trials was variable, with no single trial meeting all six of the main quality criteria examined (randomisation, allocation concealment, blind outcome assessment, completeness of follow-up/intention-to-treat analysis, free of selective outcome reporting, free of other sources of bias).</P>
<P>Anthropometry is widely used to monitor infant growth and to estimate child nutritional status. Gorstein et al (<LINK REF="REF-Gorstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorstein 1994</LINK>) have described the three most frequently used indices as weight-for-height, height-for-age and weight-for-age, with the latter being the least preferred of the three indices. Weight-for-height is perhaps the most useful of the indices for several reasons: it is sensitive to weight change over a short time period, it is useful in identifying wasted children, and it can be used in populations where age is unknown or inaccurate. The only advantage of height-for-age over weight-for-height is for the identification of stunted children. Increasingly, child growth status, in terms of the indices mentioned, is being expressed as z-scores or sd-scores (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1990</LINK>), providing a summary of how a child's or population's measurements relate to a suitable reference population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1986</LINK>). A key advantage of the z-score is that values from a study population are likely to be normally distributed. Only two of the included RCTs presented data in this manner (<LINK REF="STD-Prahl-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prahl 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masarei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Masarei 2007</LINK>). The z-scores presented in the papers have not been displayed graphically in this review in order to make the results from the included trials more comparable. However, it is recommended that future trials do present weight-for-height z-scores.</P>
<P>Further large, high quality RCTs, with developmental and behavioural outcomes measured well into childhood, are needed to assess the effectiveness of feeding aids and support for babies with clefts of the lip, palate or lip and palate. This would allow for more conclusive findings than those presented within this systematic review due to the methodological inconsistencies of the included studies. In particular squeezable feeding bottles appear promising and should be further assessed. Multicentre studies may be useful in ascertaining larger numbers of participants, reducing the heterogeneity of the sample and providing adequate power for the investigation. Intervention studies which provide adequate data for subgroup analysis, comparing outcomes for cleft lip, cleft palate and cleft lip and palate, would be helpful. Attention needs to be given to the indices used to present data relating to child growth. Future studies also need to consider length of follow-up and ensure all studies follow infant growth at least to the age of 2 years of age to adequately control for other factors that may influence growth such as anaesthesia, illness and surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>This review attempted to provide a comprehensive assessment of multiple feeding interventions for infants with cleft lip and/or palate. The methods employed to identify studies allowed for a wide range of papers to be identified and included. However, the methodological quality of the included studies made it difficult to accurately compare studies of similar quality and with similar populations. Cleft lip, cleft palate and cleft lip and palate are three different cleft sub-phenotypes that might have a significant effect in terms of outcomes. However the included papers often did not provide enough information about the proportions of each sub-phenotype, or contain sufficient numbers of each to allow separate analysis of these groups.</P>
<P>Although the authors of this review attempted to pool the data in such a way to allow for small variations in data collection processes within each study, this is a possible area of bias. Measurements across the studies were not always collected in consistent ways, and the timings of measurements varied making it difficult to pool the data across multiple studies in a meaningful way.</P>
<P>It must also be noted that although many of the studies within the review highlighted that infants with known chromosomal abnormalities were excluded, this is always easy to assess. Particularly in the case of isolated cleft palate chromosomal abnormalities are common and it is often difficult to identify these micro-deletions that can be associated with developmental delay and impact on growth.</P>
<P>The follow-up periods of the included studies were not of sufficient length to allow for variations in growth that may be caused by confounding factors such as the impact of surgery, anaesthesia and other illnesses. Follow-up to the end of the second year of life would allow a more accurate assessment of effectiveness of the included interventions.<BR/>
