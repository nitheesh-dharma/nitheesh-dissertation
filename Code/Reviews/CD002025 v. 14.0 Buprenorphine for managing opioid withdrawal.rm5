<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of buprenorphine for managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (for example, heroin or pharmaceutical opiates).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for long-term treatment of opioid dependence. The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of opioid withdrawal difficult for most people. Buprenorphine is one of the medications used to manage withdrawal from opioid drugs. This review considered whether buprenorphine is more effective than methadone in tapered doses, or better than clonidine or lofexidine, which are other medications that have been commonly used for managing opioid withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to December 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 27 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 3048 opioid-dependent participants. For 21 studies the average age of participants was in the range 25 to 40 years &#8722; in one study the average age was 47 years, while in two studies involving adolescents, the average age of participants was in the range 17 to 20 years (3 studies did not report the average age of participants). In four studies, all or nearly all participants were male, while in three studies less than half the participants were male. In most studies males comprised between one half and three-quarters of participants, a balance that is typical of the population of people who are opioid dependent. Fourteen of the studies took place in the USA, while the remaining studies were in eight other countries. The studies compared buprenorphine with methadone (6 studies), clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies), or different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction (7 studies).</P>
<P>Fourteen studies reported funding from sources other than industry; in seven studies funding or medications were provided by a pharmaceutical company. The funding source was unclear for seven studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Compared to clonidine or lofexidine, people receiving buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal will have less severe signs and symptoms, be likely to stay in treatment longer, experience fewer side effects, and be more likely to complete the scheduled period of treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine is probably similar to tapered doses of methadone, but we are uncertain whether withdrawal symptoms resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. We are also uncertain whether rapid reduction in the dose of buprenorphine is more effective than slow reduction and whether this depends on the context of withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence to be very low to moderate for the comparison of buprenorphine versus clonidine or lofexidine, low to moderate for the comparison of buprenorphine versus methadone, and very low to low for the comparison of different rates of dose reduction. Further evidence could change the findings, particularly for buprenorphine compared to methadone and for different rates of reduction of buprenorphine dose.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of interventions using buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-15 09:12:13 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains of methodological quality. Six of these studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine and two with methadone; the other four studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction.</P>
<P>For the comparison of buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of intensity of withdrawal or adverse effects. However, information reported by the individual studies was suggestive of buprenorphine and methadone having similar capacity to ameliorate opioid withdrawal, without clinically significant adverse effects. The meta-analyses that were possible support a conclusion of no difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of average treatment duration (mean difference (MD) 1.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) &#8722;8.11 to 10.72; N = 82; studies = 2; low quality) or treatment completion rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; N = 457; studies = 5; moderate quality).</P>
<P>Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine was associated with a lower average withdrawal score (indicating less severe withdrawal) during the treatment episode, with an effect size that is considered to be small to moderate (standardised mean difference (SMD) &#8722;0.43, 95% CI &#8722;0.58 to &#8722;0.28; N = 902; studies = 7; moderate quality). Patients receiving buprenorphine stayed in treatment for longer, with an effect size that is considered to be large (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; N = 558; studies = 5; moderate quality) and were more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.06; N = 1264; studies = 12; moderate quality). At the same time there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but dropout due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15; N = 134; studies = 3; low quality). The difference in treatment completion rates translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine or lofexidine.</P>
<P>For studies comparing different rates of reduction of the buprenorphine dose, meta-analysis was possible only for treatment completion, with separate analyses for inpatient and outpatient settings. The results were diverse, and we assessed the quality of evidence as being very low. It remains very uncertain what effect the rate of dose taper has on treatment outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-23 22:11:55 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of severity of withdrawal, duration of withdrawal treatment, and the likelihood of treatment completion.</P>
<P>Buprenorphine and methadone appear to be equally effective, but data are limited. It remains possible that the pattern of withdrawal experienced may differ and that withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine.</P>
<P>It is not possible to draw any conclusions from the available evidence on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose. The divergent findings of studies included in this review suggest that there may be multiple factors affecting the response to the rate of dose taper. One such factor could be whether or not the initial treatment plan includes a transition to subsequent relapse prevention treatment with naltrexone. Indeed, the use of buprenorphine to support transition to naltrexone treatment is an aspect worthy of further research.</P>
<P>Most participants in the studies included in this review were male. None of the studies reported outcomes on the basis of sex, preventing any exploration of differences related to this variable. Consideration of sex as a factor influencing response to withdrawal treatment would be relevant research for selecting the most appropriate type of intervention for each individual.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-23 21:15:40 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs (heroin, pharmaceutical opiates) is a major health and social issue in most societies. Globally, around 0.2% of adults report unsanctioned use of opioid drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>). Despite this low prevalence of opioid use, unsanctioned use of opioid drugs contributes more to the burden of disease than other illicit psychoactive drugs. The burden to the individual user and the community of opioid dependence arises from premature mortality and disability associated with dependent use, with the greatest impact in younger populations of drug users (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2015</LINK>), transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, healthcare costs, crime and law enforcement costs, and less tangible costs of family disruption and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Mark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mark 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment is central for reducing the harms incurred by individuals and the community from opioid dependence. Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, by itself is not an effective treatment for dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Rates of completion of withdrawal treatment tend to be low, and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Broers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaillant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaillant 1988</LINK>). However, withdrawal remains a required first step for many forms of long-term treatment such as residential rehabilitation and naltrexone maintenance (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). It may also represent the endpoint of an extensive period of substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine. As such, the availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective and comprehensive treatment system.</P>
<P>The signs and symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome include irritability, anxiety, apprehension, muscular and abdominal pains, chills, nausea, diarrhoea, yawning, lacrimation, sweating, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, general weakness, and insomnia. Symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome usually begin two to three half-lives after the last opioid dose, that is, 6 to 12 hours for short-acting opioids such as heroin and morphine, and 36 to 48 hours for long-acting opioids such as methadone. Following cessation of a short half-life opioid, symptoms reach peak intensity within two to four days, with most of the obvious physical withdrawal signs no longer observable after 7 to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). As with the onset of withdrawal, the duration also varies with the half-life of the opioid used and the duration of regular use (<LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>). Opioid withdrawal syndrome is rarely life-threatening or associated with significant aberrations of mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>), but the combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of withdrawal treatment difficult for most people (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tetrault-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetrault 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:27:16 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For many years routine procedures for managing opioid withdrawal involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). This approach derived from observations that the withdrawal syndrome from methadone was milder, though longer, than that from morphine. Methadone's high oral bioavailability, efficacy, and long duration of withdrawal relief (24 to 36 hours) were additional factors that contributed to its widespread use in specialist withdrawal programmes.</P>
<P>Ambivalence to the use of a drug of dependence to treat opioid dependence, government restrictions on prescription of methadone, and consumer dislike of the protracted nature of methadone withdrawal limited, to some extent, the use of methadone for managing opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>). One widely used non-opioid alternative, the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist clonidine, can also ameliorate some signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1988</LINK>), but it is associated with adverse effects of sedation and hypotension. Dissatisfaction with methadone and clonidine drove the development of a variety of alternative approaches, in particular buprenorphine.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-24 00:33:11 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assesses the partial agonist, buprenorphine, for managing the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Research activity has primarily focused on the use of buprenorphine as an alternative medication for opioid substitution treatment, but today physicians often use buprenorphine for managing withdrawal. The rationale behind this treatment approach is that the morphine-like effects of buprenorphine will suppress the physical signs and symptoms of withdrawal, but people will only experience limited withdrawal signs and symptoms because buprenorphine is a partial agonist (<LINK REF="REF-Banys-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banys 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a complex range of variables that can potentially influence the course and subjective severity of withdrawal, including the type of opioid used, dose taken, concomitant use of other drugs including alcohol, duration of use, general physical health, and psychological factors, such as the reasons for undertaking withdrawal and fear of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1985</LINK>). Outcomes of a withdrawal episode may also be influenced by a prior period of substitution treatment, since such treatment is likely to result in a degree of stabilisation in health and social functioning that may facilitate successful withdrawal. Where information is available, we have considered the influence of these variables.</P>
<P>The first, or acute, phase of withdrawal is followed by a period of about six months of a secondary or protracted withdrawal syndrome. This protracted syndrome is characterised by a general feeling of reduced well-being, which is reflected in measurable abnormal physiological functioning. During this phase, people may periodically experience strong cravings for opioids. Some authors consider that the malaise associated with protracted abstinence is a major factor in relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Satel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satel 1993</LINK>). The protracted nature of withdrawal typically makes the dependence recovery period lengthy and responsive to a range of factors, both social and treatment related. The types of intervention offered following the acute phase of withdrawal to promote recovery and prevent relapse are substantially different from those offered for managing withdrawal and may include psychological and lifestyle counselling, support groups, and pharmacological and medical treatment. We have excluded this long-term aspect of treatment of opioid dependence from this review because of its substantially different nature.</P>

</OL>
<P>Interventions aimed at the management of acute opioid withdrawal are typically of short duration. As a result, structured psychological therapies are generally not provided as adjuncts to interventions for managing withdrawal, but the episode of withdrawal management does provide the opportunity to inform people who are opioid dependent about the options for further treatment, and to encourage them to engage in treatment appropriate to their needs. The longer the duration of treatment, the more opportunities there are for interaction between treatment services and people who are opioid dependent. The relative time in treatment is also an indicator of the relative acceptability to participants of the interventions being compared. For these reasons, we considered duration of treatment in addition to treatment completion rates.</P>
<P>It is difficult to differentiate adverse effects of treatment from the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. We defined adverse effects as clinically significant signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (such as vomiting and diarrhoea) plus any incidents that are not typical components of the opioid withdrawal syndrome (hypotension, dry mouth). Early experience with clonidine, which was developed as a hypotensive agent, was that low blood pressure was a common adverse effect of clonidine treatment. This review therefore considered the occurrence of hypotension or symptoms of hypotension, withholding doses of medication and cessation of treatment as adverse effects.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-23 20:53:49 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies according to the approach recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This was based on the evaluation of seven specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and providers, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and 'other' issues). For each study, we analysed the seven domains, described them as reported in the study and provided a final judgement on the likelihood of bias in terms of low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We based these judgements on the criteria indicated by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> and their applicability to the addiction field.</P>
<P>We considered blinding separately for subjective and objective outcomes. Lack of blinding is a source of serious risk of bias for subjective outcomes but is less significant with objective outcomes, such as completion of treatment and duration of treatment. We only considered incomplete outcome data for intensity of withdrawal and the nature and incidence of adverse effects. Retention in treatment (duration of treatment) and completion of treatment are frequently primary outcome measures in addiction research. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for a detailed description of the criteria we considered in the 'Risk of bias' assessment.</P>

<P>We did not use risk of bias as a criterion for inclusion in the review. However, we assessed the impact of risk of bias through sensitivity analyses. This involved considering the overall estimate of effect when both including and excluding studies with a high risk of bias in meta-analysis. We undertook sensitivity analyses where there were at least three studies providing data on the outcome, and where we assessed at least two of these studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias for that outcome. The only domain for which we performed sensitivity analyses was performance and detection bias in subjective outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings table</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome using the GRADE system. The GRADE Working Group developed a system for grading the quality of evidence that takes into account issues not only related to internal validity but also to external validity, such as directness of results (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables present the main findings of a review in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, they provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes.</P>
<P>The GRADE system assigns grades of evidence as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We downgraded the quality of the studies for the following reasons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Serious (&#8722;1) or very serious (&#8722;2) study limitation for risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Serious (&#8722;1) or very serious (&#8722;2) inconsistency between study results.</LI>
<LI>Some (&#8722;1) or major (&#8722;2) uncertainty about directness (the correspondence between the population, the intervention, or the outcomes measured in the studies actually found and those under consideration in our systematic review).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>For 21 studies the average age of participants was in the range 25 to 40 years. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hopper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 2005</LINK>) the average age was 47 years, while in two studies involving adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2016</LINK>), the average age of participants was in the range 17 to 20 years. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ponizovsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ponizovsky 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) did not report the average age of participants.</P>
<P>In 17 of the 27 studies most or all participants were withdrawing from heroin alone or heroin and methadone. In two studies most participants were withdrawing from heroin, but a minority were using opium (<LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nigam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nigam 1993</LINK>). One study was notable in that most participants were withdrawing from prescription opioids (57% oxycodone, 39% buprenorphine) (<LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 2013</LINK>). The remaining seven studies did not report details of the nature of opioid drugs being used, although two studies excluded people dependent on methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Bickel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bickel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2009</LINK>), and two studies compared different rates of buprenorphine taper following a period of substitution treatment with buprenorphine (<LINK REF="STD-Amass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Amass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>). Hence participants in these two studies were effectively withdrawing from buprenorphine.</P>
<P>We had intended to compare outcomes for studies involving participants withdrawing from heroin versus those withdrawing from methadone, but the nature of studies meeting the inclusion criteria did not support this analysis.</P>
<P>There was considerable variability between studies in approach to the use of non-opioid drugs. Four of the studies excluded participants abusing or dependent on any psychotropic drugs other than opioids (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janiri-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Janiri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintzeris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lintzeris 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nigam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nigam 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK> excluded alcohol dependence; <LINK REF="STD-Oreskovich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oreskovich 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2011</LINK> excluded people using drugs other than opioids if medically supervised withdrawal was required, and <LINK REF="STD-Ponizovsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ponizovsky 2006</LINK> excluded people also dependent on benzodiazepines or alcohol. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Amass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Amass 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2002</LINK> who were dependent on other drugs, in addition to opioids, underwent selective detoxification prior to the study of opioid withdrawal.

<P>Opioid use is generally more common amongst men than women. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Cheskin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cheskin 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2005</LINK>, fewer than half the participants were men. In <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>, 44% of the group treated with methadone were men, compared to 71% and 69% in the buprenorphine and clonidine groups, respectively. In four studies, authors reported that all participants were men, or they were most likely all men (<LINK REF="STD-Bickel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bickel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nigam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nigam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziaaddini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ziaaddini 2012</LINK>). The significance of sex for managing opioid withdrawal is unclear, and hence the potential confounding effect of this variability in gender composition between the studies is also unclear. None of the studies report outcomes on the basis of sex, preventing further exploration of this aspect.</P>

<P>Buprenorphine has low bioavailability when administered orally (<LINK REF="REF-Elkader-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkader 2005</LINK>). When used for treating opioid dependence, buprenorphine is most commonly administered sublingually. In early studies of buprenorphine for opioid dependence, participants received buprenorphine sublingually as a solution (<LINK REF="REF-Chawarski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chawarski 2005</LINK>). Subsequently tablet preparations were developed containing either buprenorphine alone or buprenorphine plus naloxone, a combination that is intended to reduce the risk of recreational and inappropriate use (<LINK REF="REF-Larance-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larance 2011</LINK>). More recently a film preparation containing buprenorphine plus naloxone has become available for improved placement under the tongue and reduced risk of recreational use (<LINK REF="REF-Lintzeris-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lintzeris 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nine of the 27 studies included in the review reported using sublingual buprenorphine tablets, and a further five studies used the combination buprenorphine-naloxone tablets. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2016</LINK>) commenced participants on sublingual buprenorphine tablets, and transferred them to combination buprenorphine-naloxone tablets once stable. None of the studies considered for this review used the film preparation.</P>
<P>Three studies reported administering buprenorphine as a sublingual solution (<LINK REF="STD-Amass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Amass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bickel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bickel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheskin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cheskin 1994</LINK>), and three studies administered buprenorphine as intramuscular injections (<LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janiri-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Janiri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>). Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK> had been admitted to hospital for acute medical conditions, and the intramuscular route may have been preferable in this population, but the preparations in the other studies probably reflected a lack of access to sublingual tablets at the time the studies were undertaken.</P>
<P>Six studies did not report details of the buprenorphine preparation administered (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seifert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seifert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinmann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Steinmann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of factors, including route of administration, influence the bioavailability of buprenorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Chiang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strain 2004</LINK>).

<P>The seven studies that compared different rates of dose-tapering with buprenorphine varied considerably in the treatment regimens.</P>
<P>The scheduled duration of treatment for the two studies that provided treatment on an inpatient basis (<LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hopper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 2005</LINK>) was short compared to the studies undertaken on an outpatient basis. For this reason, we separated studies according to treatment setting for analyses.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK> participants in the experimental group received 4  1.5 mg doses of buprenorphine (intramuscular) on the afternoon of day 1, and 4  1.5 mg doses (intramuscular) on the morning of day 2, giving a total dose of 12 mg. The comparison group received 3 mg (intramuscular) on day 1, tapered to 0.6 mg on day 5.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hopper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 2005</LINK> used a similarly short, high dose regimen, with one group receiving buprenorphine only on day 1 (sublingual tablet, 8 mg followed by 24 mg after 30 min). The comparison group received 32 mg of buprenorphine over three days.</P>
<P>The five studies undertaken in outpatient settings differed in the period of stabilisation on buprenorphine prior to dose-tapering, the starting dose of buprenorphine and the duration of taper.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Amass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Amass 1994</LINK>, participants were stabilised on 8 mg buprenorphine for 28 days and the dose was tapered over 12 days or 36 days.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of withdrawal treatment</HEADING>
<P>Four studies reported data on length of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> reported the average weeks in treatment, encompassing the period of inpatient treatment and subsequent naltrexone maintenance treatment. We included these data (converted from weeks to days) in the inpatient subcategory, as this was the setting for detoxification. <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2005</LINK> studied separate groups in inpatient and outpatient settings &#8722; we included both sets of data as two studies in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Oreskovich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oreskovich 2005</LINK> compared two buprenorphine regimens with clonidine. We combined the data and converted results from hours to days prior to analysis. As the studies differed in the scheduled duration of treatment, we calculated a standardised mean difference rather than directly comparing the average days in treatment.</P>
<P>Based on these four studies, participants receiving buprenorphine were likely to be retained in treatment for significantly longer than those receiving clonidine (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; N = 558; studies = 5).

Authors did not report the mean length of stay, but there was a comparison of retention in treatment at day 8, the first day on which participants in both treatment protocols had completed detoxification. The authors found no significant difference between the groups, with 65% of those who received clonidine only, and 60% of the buprenorphine group remaining in treatment.</P>

<P>These data suggest no significant difference between buprenorphine and clonidine in the incidence of adverse effects, but there are differences in the nature of associated adverse effects and potentially in the severity of adverse effects experienced.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ponizovsky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ponizovsky 2006</LINK> the presence of adverse effects was measured using the Distress Scale for Adverse Symptoms (DSAS) which comprises 22 common adverse effects, each rates 0 (none) to 4 (extreme) for severity.

<P>Three studies, all taking place in an inpatient setting, reported the number of participants stopping treatment due to adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Completion of treatment</HEADING>
<P>We present data on the number of participants who completed the study or the scheduled period of treatment in <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>. Two studies reported the number of participants who received a 50 mg dose of naltrexone (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1997</LINK>). We interpreted these data as indicating the number of participants completing withdrawal treatment, but that may represent a more stringent definition of completion than is the case for other studies. The combined result indicates an advantage for buprenorphine over clonidine in terms of completion of withdrawal treatment in both inpatient (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.89; N = 539; studies = 6) and outpatient (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.88; N = 725; studies = 6) settings. The overall result (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.06; N = 1264; studies = 12) translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 2.8 to 6.7), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine. We assessed the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study, discharge from hospital depended on the acute condition leading to admission, not by completion of withdrawal treatment &#8722; 25 of 31 participants in the study were discharged from hospital prior to completion of withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Umbricht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Umbricht 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Buprenorphine versus tapered doses of methadone</HEADING>
<P>Data comparing buprenorphine versus methadone in tapered doses for managing opioid withdrawal remains limited but are suggestive of buprenorphine and methadone having similar capacity to ameliorate opioid withdrawal, without significant adverse effects. The available data suggest there is no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of average treatment duration or rates of completion of withdrawal treatment. We assessed the quality of evidence as low to moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There remains a possibility that the pattern of withdrawal symptoms may be different when managing it with buprenorphine versus methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2001</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Seifert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seifert 2002</LINK>, withdrawal severity was rated only on days 0 (baseline), 2, 8, and 14, while both buprenorphine and methadone were tapered over 11 days. These three assessment points are not sufficient to provide a clear indication of the pattern of withdrawal. <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2002</LINK> reported withdrawal scores on a daily basis up to day 18, while buprenorphine was tapered over an average of 12 days, and methadone an average of 15 days. A feature of managed withdrawal with tapered doses of methadone is that peak withdrawal severity occurs at the end of the methadone taper (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989b</LINK>). The pattern of withdrawal severity for the group treated with methadone in <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2002</LINK> is consistent with this, showing a steady climb in severity to peak around day 15. In contrast, for the buprenorphine group, withdrawal severity is high early in treatment and declines rapidly after day 10. <LINK REF="STD-Seifert-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Seifert 2002</LINK> also reported that withdrawal scores were significantly lower in the buprenorphine group in the latter stages of treatment. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Lintzeris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lintzeris 2002</LINK> reported that after ceasing buprenorphine, 5 out of 53 experienced mild and/or transient withdrawal, and 4 of 53 reported moderately severe 'rebound' withdrawal (i.e. the re-emergence of withdrawal symptoms after ceasing use of the medication for managing withdrawal). These data suggest that most individuals treated with tapered doses of buprenorphine do not experience rebound withdrawal after cessation of buprenorphine. The finding that buprenorphine has similar capacity as methadone for suppressing withdrawal signs and symptoms is consistent with findings in relation to maintenance treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2014</LINK>). Overall, however, more information is required on the patterns of withdrawal associated with tapered doses of buprenorphine and methadone in order to draw conclusions on the relative effectiveness of these drugs in terms of amelioration of the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Buprenorphine versus alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists</HEADING>
<P>The withdrawal scores and descriptive reporting of the withdrawal syndrome experienced by participants support a conclusion that buprenorphine is more effective than alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists in ameliorating the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, both in terms of the peak average withdrawal score and the average daily withdrawal score over the withdrawal episode. We assessed the quality of evidence as low to moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Available data suggest that, compared to alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists, buprenorphine is associated with greater retention in treatment, as indicated by a longer mean duration of treatment, in both inpatient and outpatient settings, with moderate quality of evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The clinical significance of a longer period of time in treatment is that it increases the opportunity for interventions to encourage engagement in further treatment following the episode of managed withdrawal.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between buprenorphine and alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine) in terms of the number of participants experiencing adverse effects. The nature of adverse effects experienced appears to differ, with dizziness, dry mouth, and lethargy being particularly common with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists and headache being most prominent with buprenorphine, while dropout from treatment because of adverse effects was somewhat more likely with alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists. The small number of events and the small number of studies providing data led us to assess the quality of evidence on adverse effects as low to very low (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Completion of withdrawal treatment is significantly more likely when managing withdrawal with buprenorphine compared to an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, in either an inpatient or an outpatient setting. The overall result translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine or lofexidine. We assessed the quality of evidence as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on engagement in postdetoxification treatment is limited, but four of the five studies reporting information suggest somewhat higher rates of engagement in further treatment following withdrawal managed with buprenorphine versus clonidine or lofexidine. The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Ziaaddini-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ziaaddini 2012</LINK>, where rates of engagement in naltrexone treatment following withdrawal were similar between buprenorphine and clonidine groups. In contrast, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Raistrick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raistrick 2005</LINK> suggest higher rates of initiation of naltrexone treatment following withdrawal managed with buprenorphine versus an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different rates of dose reduction</HEADING>
<P>Based on the two studies undertaken in an inpatient setting with short periods (five days or less) of treatment with buprenorphine, it appears that the rate of taper of the buprenorphine dose may have no significant effect on the intensity of withdrawal or the completion of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hopper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 2005</LINK>). However, the small number of studies and the differing nature of the inpatient settings (a hospital ward in <LINK REF="STD-Assadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Assadi 2004</LINK>, and a residential treatment facility in <LINK REF="STD-Hopper-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 2005</LINK>) make any findings highly uncertain (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies undertaken in outpatient settings compared buprenorphine regimens of longer duration (up to 56 days). Meta-analysis of withdrawal scores was not possible, but qualitative comments made by the authors of the studies suggest that there is a more marked increase in withdrawal associated with more rapid rates of tapering of the buprenorphine dose. There were no data on the average duration of treatment, and most studies did not comment on adverse effects. It seems unlikely for there to be differences in the nature or incidence of adverse effects based on the rate of taper of the buprenorphine dose. There was considerable variability between these four studies in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment and abstinence at completion, with low quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Two of the four studies were small, exploratory studies, reporting limited data (<LINK REF="STD-Amass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Amass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 2013</LINK> were larger studies but produced differing results: <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2009</LINK> found that completion of withdrawal treatment was more likely with a more rapid taper of the dose of buprenorphine, while <LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2016</LINK> found that completion of withdrawal treatment was more likely with a slower taper of the dose of buprenorphine. <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2016</LINK> involved adolescents, tapered buprenorphine over 28 or 56 days, and found that the frequency of clinic attendance also affected completion rates. In <LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 2013</LINK>, the use of buprenorphine to manage withdrawal was the first phase of the study. In the second phase, study participants received naltrexone maintenance treatment (plus buprenorphine placebo). Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2009</LINK> were offered naltrexone treatment as aftercare, but it was not incorporated into the study protocol as a standard component of treatment. The findings in relation to abstinence at completion of the buprenorphine dosing regimen are similarly divergent.</P>
<P>These findings leave the question of whether buprenorphine dose should be tapered rapidly or slowly unanswered and introduce the possibility that it may depend on the context of withdrawal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-15 09:45:22 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most (14 of 26) of the studies included in this review compared buprenorphine with clonidine (13 studies) or lofexidine (1 study), usually in an inpatient setting (10 studies), for managing withdrawal from heroin alone or heroin and methadone, in relatively short episodes of treatment (3 to 13 days). In this context, the finding that buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine in ameliorating the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, prolonging the duration of treatment, and increasing the likelihood of completion of treatment, is reasonably robust.</P>
<P>Fewer studies (six) compared buprenorphine versus methadone in tapered doses, while the treatment settings were more diverse, and the scheduled duration of treatment tended to be longer (up to 21 days). Historically, methadone was widely used in withdrawal management with a short-term goal of abstinence, particularly in outpatient settings, but currently the predominant use of methadone is in opioid substitution treatment where the immediate aims are retention in treatment, reduction of illicit opioid use and harms related to opioid use, and improvement of the quality of life, with abstinence a longer-term goal (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). The small number of studies comparing buprenorphine and methadone for managing opioid withdrawal is likely to be a reflection of the predominant use of methadone in opioid substitution treatment.</P>
<P>The small number of studies comparing different dose tapering schedules of buprenorphine, and the diverse findings, indicate that there is still much to learn about how to maximise the effectiveness of buprenorphine when it comes to managing opioid withdrawal in various settings and contexts. There is still very little information about managing withdrawal after a period of substitution treatment with buprenorphine, or indeed methadone, and postwithdrawal arrangements, such as transition to naltrexone, may affect preference for rapid or slow rate of dose taper.</P>

<P>Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine in reducing the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, retaining patients in withdrawal treatment, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal treatment. Buprenorphine may be associated with less dropout due to adverse effects. This finding holds for both inpatient and outpatient settings, particularly for withdrawal from heroin. The use of buprenorphine to manage withdrawal may also be associated with higher rates of engagement in postdetoxification treatment.</P>
<P>Buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses appear to have similar efficacy in managing opioid withdrawal, but limited data leave open the possibility that the pattern and timeframe of withdrawal experienced may differ.</P>
<P>It is not possible to draw any conclusions from the available evidence on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose or on factors that might determine a preference for rapid or slow rate of dose taper. It is possible that postwithdrawal arrangements, such as transition to relapse prevention treatment with naltrexone, may affect preference for the rate of taper of the buprenorphine dose during withdrawal.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-15 09:50:47 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review that compared buprenorphine with reducing doses of methadone were predominantly undertaken in inpatient settings. One of the advantages of both buprenorphine and methadone for managing opioid withdrawal is the possibility of extending the episode into substitution treatment if the individual finds it too difficult to achieve abstinence. This makes buprenorphine and methadone particularly suited to outpatient settings, where there is a greater risk of illicit opioid use during treatment. However, the use of buprenorphine and methadone in this way would blur any distinction between withdrawal management and substitution treatment. Given that both buprenorphine and methadone have been shown to be effective for long-term opioid substitution treatment, the value of research comparing the two medications in treatments with a short timeframe is questionable.</P>
<P>It is not possible, on the basis of the studies included in this review, to assess the effectiveness of buprenorphine for managing withdrawal from methadone or pharmaceutical opioids versus heroin. It is of interest that most of the studies comparing buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine involved participants withdrawing from heroin, whereas most of the studies comparing buprenorphine with methadone involved participants who were all withdrawing from other opiates. The transition from methadone to buprenorphine can be associated with precipitated withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). This is generally managed by delaying commencement of buprenorphine until the emergence of withdrawal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2014</LINK>), but this approach adds some complexity to the use of buprenorphine for managing methadone withdrawal. Given this, more information on the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine for managing withdrawal from heroin compared to methadone and other opioid drugs would be of value.</P>
<P>A notable feature of the studies included in this review is the diversity of treatment regimens, with maximum doses ranging from 0.3 mg to 3.6 mg as intramuscular injections, and from 1.2 mg to 16 mg as sublingual tablets. Furthermore, other approaches have been and are being investigated. These include the use of a single, high dose (32 mg) of buprenorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Ang_x002d_Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang-Lee 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kutz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutz 2002</LINK>), depot preparations of buprenorphine (<LINK REF="STD-Sigmon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sigmon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sobel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobel 2004</LINK>), and preparations for transdermal delivery of buprenorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Lanier-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanier 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanier 2008</LINK>). These approaches may offer ways of providing a gradual taper of buprenorphine dose with minimal supervision and are of potential value in outpatient settings. However, controlled trials have yet to test their effectiveness for managing opioid withdrawal.</P>
<P>Many aspects of the treatment protocol, including doses, frequency, and duration of buprenorphine administration, require further research to determine the most effective way to use buprenorphine for managing opioid withdrawal. Researchers should assess effectiveness in terms of objective signs and subjective symptoms that are typical of the acute phase of withdrawal, the nature of residual signs and symptoms that are not effectively suppressed by buprenorphine, the occurrence of adverse effects, and the completion of withdrawal treatment, using objective criteria such as negative urine tests (particularly for outpatient withdrawal) and/or naloxone challenges. Studies should take into account the influence of variables such as the route of administration for heroin use (inhalation or intravenous), the nature and severity of dependence (including heroin versus methadone), the setting in which withdrawal occurs, and the linkage to further treatment (such as naltrexone maintenance).</P>
