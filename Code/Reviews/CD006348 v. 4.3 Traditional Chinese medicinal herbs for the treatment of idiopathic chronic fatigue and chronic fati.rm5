<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-13 05:46:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-13 01:08:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 20:50:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fatigue may be described as a pervasive sense of tiredness or lack of energy that is not related exclusively to exertion. Fatigue may result from behavioral problems such as excess physical or mental activity, sleep deprivation, and poor diet or a range of medical conditions including infection, and cardiovascular, metabolic, connective tissue and endocrine disorders (<LINK REF="REF-De-Merlier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Merlier 2003</LINK>). Fatigue may be of known or unknown aetiology and ranges in duration from short-term to chronic. The more severe forms of fatigue include idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>). The aetiology of ICF/CFS is as yet unexplained, although numerous theories have been proposed and investigated. ICF/CFS has been identified by many names throughout its documented history; current terminology also varies depending on global region and diagnostic criteria. Some of the names that may be used to describe ICF/CFS or its subtypes include neurasthenia, post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and chronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome (CFIDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Wessely-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessely 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>CFS is characterised by severe disabling fatigue and a combination of four additional symptoms that may include impairments in cognitive or neurological function, sleep dysfunction, musculoskeletal pain, and endocrine or immune dysfunction. Additionally, alternative medical and psychiatric causes must have been ruled out, and the condition must have been present for at least six months (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>). ICF meets all of the criteria for CFS except for the need for four additional symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>). The prognosis of ICF and CFS is often poor. Longitudinal studies have reported that less than 30% of ICF and 10% of CFS patients fully recover (<LINK REF="REF-Joyce-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joyce 1997</LINK>). The prevalence of ICF and CFS in primary care has been reported at 9% and 2.6% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Wessely-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessely 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>ICF/CFS is associated with considerable disability and public health burden. The impact of these conditions is not only physical in nature but extends to psychological, social, emotional, and economic dimensions as well. Approximately 26% of ICF and 37% CFS patients are unable to work (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 1996</LINK>). Cost estimates in Britain have determined that each case of ICF/CFS in adults cost an average of £1906 over three months in informal health care and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-McCrone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrone 2003</LINK>).Similar estimates in the US reported annual individual and national losses of $20 000 and $9.1 billion (USD) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no definitive cure for ICF/CFS. Due to the unclear etiology, diagnostic uncertainty, and the heterogeneity of these populations, there are also no firmly established treatment recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>), although treatment guidelines are available in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Turnbull-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnbull 2007</LINK>). Treatment options that are used in clinical practice are directed toward relieving symptoms and improving function, and include pharmacological, immunological and antiviral agents, cognitive/behavioral therapies and physical therapies. Few clinical studies have been published for any of these options (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>). Recent evaluation of the levels of evidence for the various treatment options reported that with the exception of one pharmacologic agent for immune dysfunction, all of the treatments reviewed ranked at the lowest or second lowest levels of evidence (expert opinion of an individual or committee, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the limited treatment options offered by conventional Western medicine, the lack of evidence of effectiveness and safety for those options, and the occurrence of side effects common to conventional medications it is not surprising that sufferers of chronic fatigue use a range of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 2003</LINK>). CAM treatments that have been documented in ICF/CFS populations include massage, megavitamins and nutritional supplements, herbals, acupuncture and homeopathy, although supporting evidence for these therapies is also limited. Few clinical trials have been conducted for CAM therapies, and those that have been published are contradictory (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>), inconclusive, or have not yet been replicated (<LINK REF="REF-Wessely-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessely 1998</LINK>). Several of the CAM therapies that have been used for ICF/CFS fall under the domain of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-13 01:08:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>TCM is a health care system that evolved in China over a period of thousands of years. TCM is estimated to be used by over one quarter of the world's population, and as "a complete system of medicine, it has been selected by the World Health Organization for worldwide propagation to meet the health care needs of the twenty-first century" (<LINK REF="REF-Flaws-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaws 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The approach to health and healing differs from conventional Western medicine in that disease is believed to be the result of imbalance and disharmony between organ systems in the body and between the body and the environment. In addition, blockage in or deficiency of the body&#8217;s vital energy (known as qi) may result in illness. The goal then is to restore balance, harmony, and flow and to strengthen and support the body's innate healing capacities using therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, diet modification, Tui-na massage, therapeutic exercise, and medicinal products, including herbs. Treatment may include one or more of the available therapies and is customized and tailored to the needs of the individual patient. The aetiology of disease is not relevant to treatment, which is instead based on the presentation of patterns of symptoms. Patterns of symptoms may be as numerous as the patients who present them and are not tied to disease classifications. Patients with the same disease classification may present different patterns while patients with different diseases may present the same patterns.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of potentially useful herbs, as well as differences between TCM schools of thought and practice, and the natural variations in CFS patient symptoms, it is beyond the scope of this review to describe all the possible herbs or formulations that might be used in practice. Many TCM texts (old and new) provide treatment details for fatigue based on patient presentation; in one such text, herbs commonly used to &#8216;invigorate qi&#8217; include ginseng, astragalus root, dioscorea rhizome, poria, common curculigo, and hairy deer-horn as well as glycyrrhiza root, atractylodes rhizome, Chinese jujube, Mornda root and Himalayan teasel root. Herbs that have been recently studied through clinical research for CFS and related symptoms include single herbs such as ginseng root, poria, glycyrrhiza root, angelica root, and peony root, as well as established formulations (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-13 00:17:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Successful treatment of chronic conditions is reputed to be a strength of TCM (<LINK REF="REF-Huizing-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huizing 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2002</LINK>). Descriptions of chronically fatiguing illnesses can be found in a TCM text that is 2000 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 1994</LINK>). More recently, textbooks used for TCM training outline conditions that include ICF and CFS and the methods used to treat them (<LINK REF="REF-Maciocia-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciocia 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Becker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Flaws-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaws 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maciocia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciocia 2004</LINK>). Similarly, summary reports of treatment of chronic fatigue with TCM specifically describe common symptom patterns for CFIDS and CFS, and the corresponding approaches that are used to treat them (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>). Acupuncture, moxibustion, diet therapy, and medicinal products, including herbs, are among the therapies described.</P>
<P>There is a vast body of literature, dating back thousands of years, on the subject of Chinese medicinal products. Numerous texts have collected this information and a recent compilation, <I>The Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicinal Substances</I>, published in 1977, identified 5767 medicinal substances, of which 4773 came from plants. Through clinical experience, this list has been narrowed to 400-600 herbs in daily use (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1998</LINK>). The use of Chinese medicinal herbs specifically for the treatment of fatigue was the topic of a recent publication that provides a comprehensive review of TCM e-books. This review compares modern definitions of CFS to ancient descriptions and symptoms of fatigue conditions and details herbs used for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>Diagnosis and treatment in TCM does not readily translate into terms understood in Western medicine. Goals for treatment of CFS may include removal of dampness or heat, tonifying of various systems, and modification of qi, yin, and yang. Mechanisms of action of TCM herbs is an active area of research but few definitive answers are yet available. Patients, especially in the West, often use TCM herbs without having a clear understanding of how they many be helped, relying instead upon the knowledge and experience of their TCM practitioner. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 20:19:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ICF/CFS are postulated to be the result of a complex and mulifactoral etiology (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>), which, combined with the changing nature of symptoms over the course of disease, makes targeting of treatments very difficult. Since definitive aetiology, syndrome classification and static symptomology are not required for TCM treatment, exploration of the evidence regarding efficacy and safety is warranted.</P>
<P>Despite the popularity of TCM therapies, rigorous evaluations of the safely and effectiveness of TCM therapies for various conditions have, until recently, been lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jing 2009</LINK>). Based on the historical reports of use for chronic fatigue, existence of current treatment protocols and the need for effective treatment, the evidence associated with TCM herbal products for the treatment of ICF and CFS will be systematically evaluated.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 19:46:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous studies of TCM interventions for chronic fatigue, many of which were described as randomized, were found, however, no studies that met all inclusion criteria were identified. Upon assessment, two common reasons for exclusion were identified. The first reason was the comparison of two active treatments, neither having been previously tested for chronic fatigue. The second reason was the inappropriate use of the term &#8216;randomized&#8217; to describe allocation of patients to groups. Patient choice or order of enrolment was often used for treatment allocation in these so-called &#8220;randomized trials&#8221;, while other studies were found to be retrospective in nature.</P>
<P>What we conclude from this review is that although studies in this topic area are being conducted, methodological flaws prevent inclusion and synthesis of the results, limiting their usefulness in guiding treatment. Serious flaws in the conduct and reporting of clinical studies conducted in China have been identified, both for conventional medicine and TCM (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>). The extent of this problem is alarming and needs to be immediately addressed. The Chinese Cochrane Center has initiated steps intended to address these flaws, but in the meantime systematic review authors should be cautious in including Chinese studies based solely on published information.</P>
<P>Despite the utilization of TCM herbs for chronic fatigue, a solid evidence base for or against this treatment approach is lacking.</P>

<P>Strengths of this review include the use of extensive search terms and multiple databases, including two Chinese-language databases, to ensure that the search was comprehensive. In addition, use of author interviews to verify methodology ensured that invalid studies were not mistakenly included. Limitations include the widespread lack of complete reporting by study authors.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 21:34:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the lack of studies which meet inclusion criteria, forming conclusions about practice is not possible. RCT evidence, as defined in this review, does not currently support the use of TCM herbs for ICF/CFS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-13 01:03:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methodological improvements, such as use of placebo/sham or a therapy that is known to be effective, rather than another unproven therapy, and use of unbiased methods for treatment allocation in future studies is required for meaningful results from controlled studies, and would facilitate subsequent data synthesis.</P>
<P>Improvements in reporting are also strongly urged. Guidance on these may be found in the CONSORT statements (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2006</LINK>). Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to assess promising treatments and guide practice in the area of chronic fatigue.</P>

<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>Data will be extracted independently by two review authors using a standardised data extraction form; disagreement will be resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>The following information will be extracted: author; year, country and language of publication; funding source; objectives; study design; participant characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity, number of participants who were eligible, enrolled and completed the study; diagnostic criteria and procedures; presence of intention-to-treat analysis; presence and method of randomization, blinding and allocation concealment; numbers and reasons for withdrawals and dropouts; details of TCM and SOC treatments including number and length of treatment, dose of herbal; type of control; qualifications of practitioners; presence of co-morbid disorders or concurrent medication; details of each outcome measured as well as assessment tool(s) and assessor(s); measure of treatment effect; measure of compliance; and adverse events.</P>
<P>If necessary, principal authors will be contacted for further details of each study.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Methodological quality will be independently assessed by two review authors, using the Cochrane Collaboration &#8217;risk of bias&#8217; tool, which assesses sources of bias including methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and collection and reporting of outcomes. Disagreement will be resolved by discussion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>Dichotomous data will be presented as relative risk (of improvement), along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The number needed to treat (for improvement) and number needed to harm (for adverse events) will also be determined for statistically significant outcomes.</P>
<P>Continuous data will be presented as weighted mean differences (for common measurement units) or standardized mean differences (for differing measurement units and different scales), along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B>
</P>
<P>For studies with comparable treatment groups, data for studies with more than one active treatment arm will be entered separately into the meta-analysis and the control arm data will be evenly divided as much as possible between entries.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
</P>
<P>In instances where information appears to be missing, study authors will be asked to provide the information. In cases where SDs are unavailable and not appropriated from the authors, SDs will be obtained using a method appropriate to the situation, as outlined in Wiebe et al (<LINK REF="REF-Wiebe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiebe 2006</LINK>). For studies that report only per protocol analyses, and where sufficient information is available, intention to treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted. For missing dichotomous data, in sensitivity analyses best/worst case scenarios will be calculated in order to determine minimum effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity will be quantified with the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic describes the proportion of variance due to between-study variance (rather than within-study variance). Where there are eight or more studies included in a comparison, meta-regression, performed in Stata, will be carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>). In the event of less than eight studies per sub-group, Deek's Chi-square test for heterogeneity will be used (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting bias</B>
<BR/>Publication bias will be assessed visually using funnel plots, and quantitatively assessed using weighted regression (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Random effects models will be used for the primary analyses, as a more conservative estimate of effect than fixed effect models.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses will be carried out on the following categories:<BR/>1. subtype of chronic fatigue (ICF versus CFS)<BR/>2. age (paediatric versus adult)<BR/>3. severity of fatigue before treatment<BR/>4. duration of fatigue before treatment<BR/>5. primary investigator's diagnostic or inclusion criteria<BR/>6. outcome measurement tool</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses will be carried out on study quality score. In a further sensitivity analysis, we will apply intention-to-treat principles with loss to follow-up data.</P>
