<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Interventions for treating functional dysphonia in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Functional dysphonia is characterised by an abnormal quality of voice in the absence of an identifiable lesion. People in occupations where voice use is central, like teachers, are more at risk of developing functional dysphonia. The causes of voice disorders are still being debated. There is also no consensus on the best method of evaluating voice, although many consider auditory voice quality assessment as a gold standard measure. Because functional dysphonia is a non-organic voice disorder there is no indication for surgical or medical interventions, and it is treated with behavioural (i.e. voice) therapy. Voice therapy usually consists of a combination of direct and indirect treatment techniques. Direct techniques focus on the underlying physiological changes needed to improve an individual's technique in using the vocal system whereas indirect techniques concentrate on contributory and maintenance aspects of the voice disorder (such as lack of knowledge).</P>
<P>We conducted a systematic search of the literature on treating functional dysphonia in adults. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and combined their results.</P>
<P>A combination of direct and indirect voice therapy is effective in improving vocal functioning when compared to no intervention. The achieved results may still be apparent after a year.</P>
<P>Most of the studies are small and of low methodological quality and further research is warranted.<BR/>
</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Poor voice quality due to functional dysphonia can lead to a reduced quality of life. In occupations where voice use is substantial it can lead to a loss of employment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to treat functional dysphonia in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (PubMed, 1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2 2006), CINAHL (1983 to 2006), PsychINFO (1967 to 2006), Science Citation Index (1986 to 2006) and the Occupational Health databases OSH-ROM (to 2006). The date of the last search was 5<SUP>th</SUP> April 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions evaluating the effectiveness of treatments targeted at adults with functional dysphonia. For work-directed interventions interrupted time series and prospective cohort studies were also eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified six randomised controlled trials including a total of 163 participants in intervention groups and 141 controls. One trial was high quality. Interventions were grouped into 1) Direct voice therapy 2) Indirect voice therapy 3) Combination of direct and indirect voice therapy and 4) Other treatments: pharmacological treatment and vocal hygiene instructions given by phoniatrist.</P>
<P>No studies were found evaluating direct voice therapy on its own. One study did not show indirect voice therapy on its own to be effective when compared to no intervention. There is evidence from three studies for the effectiveness of a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy on self-reported vocal functioning (SMD -1.07; 95% CI -1.94 to -0.19), on observer-rated vocal functioning (WMD -13.00; 95% CI -17.92 to -8.08) and on instrumental assessment of vocal functioning (WMD -1.20; 95% CI -2.37 to -0.03) when compared to no intervention. The results of one study also show that the remedial effect remains significant for at least 14 weeks on self-reported vocal functioning (SMD -0.51; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.14) and on observer-rated vocal functioning (Buffalo Voice Profile) (WMD -0.80; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.46). There is also limited evidence from one study that the number of symptoms may remain lower for a year. The combined therapy with biofeedback was not shown to be more effective than combined therapy alone in one study nor was pharmacological treatment found to be more effective than vocal hygiene instructions given by phoniatrist in one study. Publication bias may have influenced the results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence is available for the effectiveness of comprehensive voice therapy comprising both direct and indirect therapy elements. Effects are similar in patients and in teachers and student teachers screened for voice problems. Larger and methodologically better studies are needed with outcome measures that match treatment aims.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-25 17:33:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Voice disorders are generally characterised by abnormalities in pitch, loudness and/or quality of the voice that can limit the effectiveness of oral communication (<LINK REF="REF-Ramig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramig 1998</LINK>). Recent definitions of a disordered voice stress the ability of the voice to fulfil the speaker's social and occupational requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sataloff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sataloff 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stemple-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stemple 1995</LINK>). Due to the difficulties of classifying voice disorders in a systematic way, there is no universally accepted classification system for voice problems (<LINK REF="REF-Oates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 2004</LINK>). Traditionally, two major classes of voice disorder have been identified: organic and functional (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcus-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcus 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Functional disorders are characterised by an abnormal quality of voice in the absence of an identifiable lesion. Some clinicians label them as idiopathic, indicating that there is no known cause, while others view them as resulting from the individual's improper use of his or her voice (<LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>). The improper use of voice (also known as vocal misuse) refers to functional voicing behaviours (e.g. excessive shouting or loud talking) and/or functional misuse of vocal components (respiration, phonation, resonance, pitch, loudness and rate) that can contribute to the development of laryngeal pathologies (<LINK REF="REF-Stemple-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stemple 1995</LINK>). When the classification into functional versus organic emphasises the aetiology of the problem (vocal strain or excessive muscular tension), minor tissue changes such as vocal-fold thickening and vocal nodules are often considered functional (<LINK REF="REF-Boone-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 1987</LINK>) or behavioural (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcus-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcus 1986</LINK>). Therefore, in a strict sense dichotomous classification is undeniably problematic and overly simplistic. In this review we define functional dysphonia as an impaired voice sound and/or reduced vocal capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seifert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seifert 2005</LINK>) with a possible concomitant diagnosis of minor pathologies of vocal fold cover (nodules, polyps, oedema) that are direct results of either vocal misuse or result from trauma caused to vocal fold tissues by phonatory behaviour.</P>
<P>The prevalence of voice disorders in the general adult population has been suggested to be between 3% and 9% in the USA and at about 4% in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Verdolini-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdolini 2001</LINK>). In the UK up to 40,000 patients with dysphonia are referred to voice therapy every year (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>). Professional voice users such as teachers and singers are at significantly higher risk of developing a voice disorder compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>). It has been estimated that at least in developed countries, a well functioning voice is an essential tool for a third of the entire adult working population (<LINK REF="REF-Vilkman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilkman 2004</LINK>). In Poland, occupational voice problems ranked highest among all occupational diseases in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Szeszenia_x002d_D.-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szeszenia-D. 2005</LINK>). In a group of 1262 voice patients, the prevalence of vocal pathologies that could be considered as functional dysphonia (no visible pathology) or as being direct results of traumatising phonatory behaviour (vocal nodules, oedema, polyps) was 57.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Herrington_x002d_Hall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrington-Hall 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The voice is a multidimensional function that, like physical strength, cannot be measured with any one single scale or test (<LINK REF="REF-Hirano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirano 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartl 2005</LINK>). Measures of voice have therefore been developed to cover widely different perspectives including, for example: aerodynamic, visual and auditory perceptual, physiological and acoustic measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK>). To increase comparability of the results of individual studies, it has been suggested that all studies of vocal treatment effectiveness should perform an extensive battery of tests (<LINK REF="REF-Dejonckere-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dejonckere 2001</LINK>). On the other hand, in order to ensure that the results are clinically relevant it has been suggested that the outcome measures should be matched to treatment goals and to efficacy criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK>). For some time now, the patient's own views regarding judgements of the benefits of treatment have been acknowledged as also being important (<LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1995</LINK>). A number of patient self-report questionnaires, such as the Voice Handicap Index (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1999</LINK>), the Voice-Related Quality of Life (<LINK REF="REF-Hogikyan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogikyan 1999</LINK>), the Vocal Performance Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1992</LINK>) and the Voice Activity and Participation Profile (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2001</LINK>) have been developed to measure the subjective impact of voice problems.</P>
<P>In this review we chose self-reported measures of voice handicap, voice symptoms and voice-related quality of life as primary indicators of treatment effectiveness. This is because of the variation between individuals as to how a particular voice disturbance can be perceived to affect their communication or ability to fulfil social and occupational requirements. All other measures of vocal or laryngeal performance are considered as secondary outcomes, along with measures of sickness absence and return to work.</P>
<P>When it comes to the treatment of functional dysphonia, most experts agree that surgical or medical interventions are not indicated (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>). Voice therapy is considered effective for the treatment of voice disorders caused by vocal misuse (<LINK REF="REF-Stemple-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stemple 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Colton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 2006</LINK> states that: "In general, the goal of voice therapy is to restore the best voice possible, a voice that will be functional for purposes of employment and general communication". There are numerous different therapy techniques available for the treatment of patients with dysphonia (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK>). These techniques fall into two main categories:</P>
<P>1) Indirect treatment techniques that concentrate on psychosocial aspects such as patient education (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1985</LINK>), auditory training (<LINK REF="REF-Boone-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fawcus-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcus 1986</LINK>) and vocal hygiene programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1987</LINK>);<BR/>2) Direct treatment techniques that concentrate on mechanical or physical aspects such as the yawn-sigh method (<LINK REF="REF-Boone-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 1993</LINK>), establishing optimal pitch (<LINK REF="REF-Boone-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 1983</LINK>) and laryngeal manipulation (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies of the effectiveness of interventions for preventing the onset or relapse of a voice disorder have also been conducted, and since such measures are taken in the absence of a diagnosed voice disorder they have been dealt with in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Ruotsalainen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruotsalainen 2007</LINK>). In this review we proposed to establish whether interventions aimed at treating adult patients diagnosed with functional (non-organic) dysphonia are effective when compared to no intervention or to alternative interventions.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1) To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating functional (non-organic) dysphonia compared to no intervention or an alternative intervention.</P>
<P>2) To categorise interventions aimed at treating patients diagnosed with functional (non-organic) dysphonia.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled studies or cluster-randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatments targeted at individuals with functional dysphonia. For environmental or work-related treatment interventions, it is much more difficult to randomise when the intervention is applied at the group level. For this type of intervention we also considered for inclusion prospective cohort studies (otherwise known as controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies or quasi-experimental studies).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies in which the participants were adults (16 or over) who had been diagnosed as having functional / non-organic dysphonia, which means that they are experiencing one of the following two symptoms: </P>
<P>1) an impaired voice sound;<BR/>2) reduced vocal capacity. </P>
<P>The voice changes throughout life. In childhood the morphology of vocal fold tissues keeps changing and during puberty the larynx grows (<LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>). The three connective tissue layers of the lamina propria, despite being apparent already during puberty, continue to become more differentiated until the age of 16 or 17 (<LINK REF="REF-Colton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 2006</LINK>). In advanced age some age-related changes (e.g. ossification, atrophy, dystrophy and oedema) affect phonation (<LINK REF="REF-Jasper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasper 2000</LINK>). However, it is the physiological rather than the chronological age that has a strong impact on how well the larynx functions in phonation (<LINK REF="REF-Titze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titze 1994</LINK>). In this study we consider patients older than 16 years as adults. For practical reasons, we also included studies in which a minority of participants (less than 50%) may have been diagnosed with minor tissue changes of vocal fold cover (nodules, polyps, oedema) that are regarded as a result of vocal misuse.</P>
<P>We excluded studies in which any of the participants had been diagnosed as having any of the following: </P>
<UL>
<LI> a voice disorder associated with local nervous system involvement (e.g. spasmodic dysphonia, essential laryngeal tremor, vocal fold paralysis); </LI>
<LI> neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, Tourette's, essential tremor, paralysis);</LI>
<LI> organic disease or trauma (e.g. keratosis, contact ulcers, papillomas, laryngeal granulomas and inhalation, thermal etc. traumas);</LI>
<LI> the paediatric (e.g. with congenital anomalies) or the geriatric voice;</LI>
<LI> carcinoma or other tumours;</LI>
<LI> gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We also excluded studies in which participants had been diagnosed with a hearing impairment which may affect auditory discrimination.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included studies with any intervention aiming to treat patients diagnosed with functional (non-organic) dysphonia. We categorised interventions as: </P>
<P>1) Direct voice therapy meaning that the therapy is applied directly to the voice production apparatus; <BR/>2) Indirect voice therapy meaning therapy that is applied to other mental or bodily structures or functions that influence voice production; <BR/>3) Combination of direct and indirect voice therapy;<BR/>4) Other treatments. </P>
<P>We compared interventions with no intervention and, when possible, with alternative interventions.</P>

<P>We searched MEDLINE (PubMed, 1950 to March 2006), EMBASE (embase.com, 1974 to March 2006), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2006), CINAHL (OVID, 1983 to March 2006), PsychINFO (webSPIRS, 1967 to February 2006), Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science, Thomson, 1986 to March 2006) and the Occupational Health databases OSH-ROM (webSPIRS, to February 2006). The search string for randomised controlled trials is based on <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK> and the string for non-randomised studies on <LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 2005</LINK>. Since the opportunities for naming and classifying voice disorders and their various treatments are so abundant, the searches were developed with the aim of maximum sensitivity at the expense of specificity. The date of the last search was 5<SUP>th</SUP> April 2006.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-25 17:44:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review, it was clear that allocation concealment could not be an issue since the nature of treatments for voice disorders renders it impossible for the patients to be unaware of whether or not they are receiving active treatment. We nonetheless assessed whether allocation was concealed for those assessing the outcome, when it came to secondary observer-rated outcomes. Two authors (JR and JS) independently assessed trial quality using the quality criteria mentioned in the Cochrane Handbook for the Systematic Review of Interventions. This consisted of an appraisal of the studies in terms of their randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding procedures as well as attrition suffered. See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for a listing of the judgements that we made in terms of these four criteria. Studies were rated as high quality if they were found adequate in terms of all four quality criteria (or three in cases where blinding was not an issue). For the appraisal of cohort studies, we were going to use a validated instrument (<LINK REF="REF-Slim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slim 2003</LINK>). No cohort studies were however included in this review. Disagreements were settled through discussion.</P>

<P>For interventions directed at individuals, we used only randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions. For work- or environment-directed interventions that are applied at the group level we were going to include also prospective cohort studies but none were identified that met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The decision to pool quantitatively was based first on clinical homogeneity. Clinically homogeneous studies were defined as those with similar populations, interventions and outcomes measured at the same follow-up point. We pooled studies with sufficient data, judged to be clinically homogeneous, with RevMan 4.2.5 software. The scoring of a scale was reversed for the purposes of pooling if a high score denoted a good outcome (e.g. Voice-Related Quality of Life) instead of more pronounced dysphonia.</P>
<P>A rating system, based on the Levels of Evidence, was used to summarise the strength of scientific evidence of the effects of the treatment.

<I>Study selection<BR/>
</I>
</B>From the initial set of 5937 references identified by the systematic searches, a set of 48 potentially eligible studies were identified. These were then scrutinised further with regard to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Altogether 40 studies were excluded (see 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table) leaving a total of eight studies. However, we noticed that two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 2004</LINK>) actually reported results of the same study so we excluded the one published later. The first was published in Czech and the later one in English. We felt that there was no reason to favour the latter just because of language. We also found out from the author himself that two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>) actually used the same participants. We included the later one where more participants were added to the sample used in the previous study. Thus, our final sample consisted of six studies (see 'Characteristics of included studies' table).</P>
<P>Additional information regarding study details and/or statistical data was sought from six authors and was received from four. One of the authors provided statistical data that had not been published in his article.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Study designs<BR/>
</I>
</B>All six of the included studies were randomised controlled trials of person-directed interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Country and time period<BR/>
</I>
</B>All of the included studies were conducted in Europe: three in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, one in Denmark and one in Finland. One of the included studies was conducted in 1999 and five in 2001 or later.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Type of settings and participants<BR/>
</I>
</B>All of the interventions were carried out in clinical settings. In four of the studies the participants were consecutive patients in a speech and language therapy clinic. In <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> the participants were teachers with self-reported symptoms who were recruited and in <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK> they were student teachers who were screened for inclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sample sizes<BR/>
</I>
</B>The total number of participants in the various intervention groups was 163, and in the control groups 141. The number of participants in the smallest study groups was less than 20 in three studies, between 20 and 60 in two studies, and more than 60 in one study (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>). This one study was the only one that had conducted <I>a priori</I> power calculations to ensure that experimental groups were large enough (i.e. there would be sufficient statistical power) to detect significant differences.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Interventions<BR/>
</I>
</B>We found the following types of interventions:<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>1. Direct voice therapy<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</B>No studies were found that evaluated the effectiveness of direct therapy alone. Direct techniques focus on the underlying physiological changes needed to improve an individual's technique in using the vocal system. Direct voice therapy usually consists of an individually tailored combination of some of the following techniques: specific laryngeal relaxation, yawn-sigh method, chewing technique, altering tongue position, diaphragmatic breathing, co-ordination of breathing with phonation, establishing and maintaining appropriate laryngeal tone, pitch variation and control, reduction of vocal loudness, elimination of glottal attack, establishing optimal pitch, voice 'placing', developing optimal resonance and maintenance and generalisation of optimal phonatory control.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Indirect voice therapy<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</B>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>) looked at indirect voice therapy alone. Indirect techniques concentrate on the contributory and maintenance aspects of the voice disorder (such as lack of knowledge). This usually consists of an individually tailored combination of some of the following: patient education, reassurance, general relaxation, counselling, auditory training, elimination of abuse/misuse, voice diary, vocal hygiene program, avoidance of irritants, environmental awareness and voice conservation advice.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Combination of direct and indirect voice therapy<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</B>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>) examined the effectiveness of a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) looked at the added effect of patient feedback using trans-nasal flexible laryngoscopy (TFL). TFL is a tool that is widely used for diagnosis but can also be used to give a patient direct feedback on how treatment is affecting the behaviour of his or her vocal cords.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Other treatments</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK>) compared the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment with vocal hygiene instructions given by phoniatrist. Pharmacological treatment consisted of treatment as deemed appropriate for allergy, infection, reflux or environmental irritants (e.g. dust or noise).<I>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK>) measured Voice-Related Quality of Life (<LINK REF="REF-Hogikyan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogikyan 1999</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK>) used the Voice Symptom Severity scale (<LINK REF="REF-Deary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deary 2003</LINK>). One study used a questionnaire concerning the prevalence of seven vocal symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for a description of the scales used, their minimum and maximum values and what they mean.</P>

<B>2.1. Secondary outcomes: observer-rated measures<BR/>
</B>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>) measured voice quality with the GRBAS scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hirano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirano 1989</LINK>) whilst <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> used his own overall severity rating scale. One study (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) used the Buffalo Voice Profile (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1987</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) performed laryngeal examinations. One study measured vocal fry and pitch (<LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.2. Secondary outcomes: instrumental measures<BR/>
</B>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) performed acoustic analyses. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>) measured fundamental frequency and/or intensity.</P>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) compared two active interventions with one another.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Acceptability of treatment</I>
</B>
<BR/>As to drop-outs prior to randomisation or participants declining participation we found information on this topic in three of the six included studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK> four out of 24 subjects (17%) withdrew before randomisation. No information is given as to reasons why or about their personal characteristics. In <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> one patient declined to enter the study and was subsequently treated outside of the project. In <LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK> there is a discrepancy in figures so that according to the text 18 patients were randomised but in the table of patient characteristics there are only 16 patients in the two groups. It is impossible to say if two patients were excluded or if it is a typing mistake. In general it seems that participation in treatment trials appears to be acceptable for functional dysphonia patients. We do not think this has had an effect on our results in relation to external validity.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow up<BR/>
</I>
</B>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) conducted only before and immediately after intervention measurements. In fact, <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> apparently had done measurements immediately after the intervention but he only reported four-week follow-up scores and so these were entered as immediately after intervention data. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>) followed up the long-term effectiveness of the interventions employed. The length of follow up differed from 14 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) to one year (<LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>) although in the latter case only information from one symptom questionnaire was available instead of data from all the measurements.</P>

<P>The method of randomisation was adequate in two studies that employed computer generated random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>). In one study, allocation was by rotation which was considered inadequate (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>). In another study, after contacting the authors, it appeared that participants had assigned themselves into groups by drawing lots from a hat (<LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>) which was also considered inadequate. We did not get information on the randomisation procedure of the other two studies which were therefore listed as unclear (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>When it comes to the treatment of functional dysphonia the concealment of allocation into intervention and control groups is not an issue for participants as they cannot help but notice if they are receiving treatment or not. However, <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK> did not report if the randomisation procedure was concealed from the researchers.</P>
<P>All studies reported some descriptive data comparing the study groups after allocation thus portraying the acceptability of the randomisation procedure. <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> reported that the groups were comparable for mean age, gender, laryngeal features and subjective and objective voice variables. <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK> reported baseline comparability only for mean age, whilst the remaining four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beranova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beranova 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) reported also that some of the following items were comparable at baseline: age range, male to female ratio, laryngeal diagnosis, average duration of problems, mean onset of problems and years of teaching.</P>

</B>3.1 Primary outcome: Self-report measures of vocal functioning<BR/>A combination of direct and indirect voice therapy is effective in improving vocal functioning (SMD -1.07; 95% CI -1.94 to -0.19) when compared to no intervention and when measured with the Vocal Performance Questionnaire (VPQ) and the Voice-Related Quality of Life scale (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>). When we transformed the effect size back to a score on the VPQ this yielded a mean difference of -11.3. This covers 25% of the range of the VPQ scale. There was considerable heterogeneity in this meta-analysis of direct and indirect interventions combined. Possible reasons for the heterogeneity are publication bias and differences in responsiveness to change of the scales used and in methodological quality of studies. It cannot be due to differences in sample (e.g. vocal loading) because <LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> used consecutive patients and <LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> used volunteer teachers and their results were nonetheless quite similar. The difference between <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> and the other two studies is probably due to higher methodological quality which has led to more realistic results.</P>
<P>3.1.2 Long-term follow up of self-reported vocal functioning<BR/>The results of <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> show that the intervention group's vocal performance remained better than the control group's at 14 weeks' follow up (SMD -0.51; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.14). According to the results of <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK> the intervention group's number of voice-related symptoms also remained lower for a year.</P>
<P>3.2 Secondary outcome: Observer-rated measurement of vocal quality<BR/>Buffalo Voice Profile<BR/>A combination intervention has no initial effect on voice quality (WMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.51 to 0.11) when compared to no intervention and when measured with the Buffalo Voice Profile immediately following the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>). However, after 14 weeks of follow-up the same measurement becomes significant meaning that the voice quality of patients in the intervention group had improved (WMD -0.80; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.46).</P>
<P>GRBAS - Grade<BR/>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK> show the combination of direct and indirect voice therapy as being effective in improving vocal functioning (WMD -13.00; 95% CI -17.92 to -8.08) when compared to no intervention and when measured with GRBAS overall Grade.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> shows that a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy is not effective in improving vocal functioning when compared to no intervention and when measured with pitch perturbation immediately following intervention (WMD 0.00; 95% CI -0.53 to 0.53) or after 14 weeks of follow up (WMD 0.50; 95% CI -0.04 to 1.04).</P>
<P>Amplitude perturbation (shimmer)<BR/>According to the results of <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy is effective in improving vocal functioning when compared to no intervention and when measured with amplitude perturbation immediately following intervention (WMD -1.20; 95% CI -2.37 to -0.03) but not at 14 weeks of follow up (mean difference -0.40; 95% CI -1.61 to 0.81).</P>

<B>
<I>Subgroup analyses<BR/>
</I>
</B>Because interventions might work differently with groups with heavy vocal load we looked separately at studies that included only workers. There were two studies that screened teachers or teacher students for vocal problems (<LINK REF="STD-Gillivan_x002d_Murphy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gillivan-Murphy 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Simberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simberg 2006</LINK>). The severity of problems in these studies was about 25% of the maximum attainable unfavourable score. This was slightly lower than the patient studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) with 58% and 33% respectively. The outcomes were comparable between patient and teacher studies. Both teacher studies had a positive outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Publication bias<BR/>
</I>
</B>We included studies that compared any intervention with no intervention control because we felt that these would yield similar results. The number of studies is too low for drawing any valid conclusions from a funnel plot.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The meta-analyses in this review show that there is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy on vocal functioning when compared to no intervention. There is also moderate evidence from one study that the remedial effect of a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy as measured with patient-reported vocal performance or with observer-rated perceptual assessment (Buffalo Voice Profile) remains significant for at least 14 weeks. There is limited evidence from another study that the number of symptoms may remain lower for a year.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK> states that direct and indirect modes of intervention are not mutually exclusive as some indirect treatment is usually also incorporated in direct treatment. He writes that indirect approaches are based on the assumption that inappropriate phonatory behaviour is a symptom of excessive demands on the voice, abusive behaviours, personal anxiety and tension levels and a lack of knowledge regarding healthy voice production. Direct voice therapy is based on the assumption that the patient with functional dysphonia has adopted an incorrect and potentially damaging mode of voice production. Direct techniques aim to identify the inappropriate pattern of phonation and to enable the patient to correct her phonatory function. </P>
<P>This categorisation of interventions into direct and indirect modes is only one way to describe the contents of voice therapy. There are also many other ways to divide voice therapy approaches. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Stemple-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stemple 2000</LINK> has divided voice therapy into symptomatic, psychogenic, hygienic, eclectic and physiological approaches. <LINK REF="REF-Boone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 2005</LINK> has categorised voice therapies into cognitive, gestalt-holistic, resonant therapy, vocal function exercise, visualisation and symptomatic therapy approaches. It is important to remember that all categorisations of the various ways in which the voice can be treated are somewhat arbitrary and that therapists will in any case use a combination of methods to meet the individual needs of each patient (<LINK REF="REF-Boone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boone 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was mostly poor. Most randomised controlled trials were small and in all but two of the included randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rattenbury-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rattenbury 2004</LINK>) the method of randomisation was not reported or not valid. It was also difficult to get a good impression of the concealment of allocation from researchers. We assumed that outcomes that were measured by questionnaire were reported blind to the researchers but we could not be certain about this assumption. The reporting of some studies was of low quality as well which is reflected in having to contact the authors for further information. According to our classification of the studies, only one of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) was high quality in terms of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and dealing with attrition. The results of this high quality study are consistent with the overall conclusions of this systematic review. We did not find any studies of work-directed/environmental interventions that satisfied our inclusion criteria. </P>
<P>To make sure we did not overlook any relevant evidence we also present an overview of published controlled non-randomised trials of person-directed voice treatment interventions (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Popovici-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Popovici 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sliwinska_x002d_K.-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sliwinska-K. 2002</LINK>) had results that are in line with the conclusions of the randomised trials meaning that voice therapy is effective in both teachers and in patients. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-Real-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia Real 2002</LINK>) found a therapeutic benefit for hydration with or without voice training and another study (<LINK REF="STD-Mendoza_x002d_Lara-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mendoza-Lara 1990</LINK>) found that EMG biofeedback training was effective. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1986</LINK>), did not find any significant differences between EMG biofeedback training and progressive relaxation. No trials were found with results clearly refuting the effectiveness of voice therapy or with results showing harmful effects.</P>
<P>Since most of the studies were small and reported positive outcomes it is conceivable that there may have been publication bias involved. Language bias was corrected for by not having language restrictions in the systematic search strategy and by translating articles written in languages that the authors were not proficient in. Only two of the six non-randomised controlled trials initially considered for inclusion had been published in English, another two were published in Spanish, one in Polish and one in Romanian.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Clinical relevance</I>
</B>
<BR/>Even though the result of the meta-analysis was significant and it covered 25% of the range of the Vocal Performance Questionnaire after transformation, we cannot be sure how this is related to the clinical relevance of the changes achieved in the studies. There is no generally accepted change in the two self-report measures used (Vocal Performance Questionnaire and Voice-Related Quality of Life) that would be regarded as clinically relevant. Studies are needed to determine what is the relation between a change score on the questionnaires and an important amount of change in outcome as rated by patients (cf. <LINK REF="REF-Stratford-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratford 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Comparison with other reviews</I>
</B>
<BR/>There are no previous reports of systematic reviews or meta-analyses available in the literature that are concerned with voice therapy or interventions for treating functional dysphonia. Previous narrative literature reviews or overviews (<LINK REF="REF-Carding-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carding 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ramig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramig 1998</LINK>) have identified altogether a total of 87 articles, published between 1960 and 2001, that have evaluated the effectiveness of voice therapy. According to <LINK REF="REF-Oates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 2004</LINK>, 12 of the 87 published studies can be categorised as randomised controlled trials. Half of these have investigated treatment methods for patients with Parkinson's disease whilst the remainder have evaluated the accent method in patients with various aetiologies, vocal function exercises in subjects with normal voice and in teachers. Only two of the studies included in these previous reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Carding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) have studied the effectiveness of voice therapy for functional dysphonia. Both studies were included in this review. It is also important to note that the definition of functional dysphonia is not synonymous across studies. Functional dysphonia, psychogenic dysphonia, mechanical dysphonia, muscle tension dysphonia, functional voice disorder, hyperfunctional voice, hyperfunctional dysphonia and non-organic dysphonia have all been used to describe dysphonia in the absence of organic pathology. The latest addition to this abundance of terminology is Verdolini's concept of phonotrauma. It adds greatly to the difficulty of comparing and combining studies when they are seemingly dealing with different issues.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>A combination of direct and indirect voice therapy should be considered as a primary or best available intervention method for functional dysphonia at the moment. The diagnosis 'functional dysphonia' does not, however, in itself reveal what aspects of vocal or speech production (pitch, loudness, intonation, phonation, tempo, breathing, resonance or overall tension) needs to be modified. The therapist must choose the aims and the specific techniques of voice therapy accordingly. Screening and subsequently treating teachers and student teachers is a feasible approach and yields positive results. Before widespread implementation can be recommended better quality studies are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the high volume of dysphonia treatment, more research evaluating the effects of treatment is needed. Our review contains one high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-MacKenzie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacKenzie 2001</LINK>) only which indicates a need for more high quality studies. These future studies should include randomisation of participants to intervention and control groups and have sufficient statistical power to detect a mean change of ten points on the Vocal Performance Questionnaire. Having access to only small numbers of participants can be overcome by organising a multi-centre study. As participants, persons with a high vocal load should particularly be included. The interventions should involve both direct and indirect techniques but according to a well designed protocol. The comparison should still be a no intervention, observation only control group, or if this is deemed unacceptable a minimal intervention only. Assuming that the interventions are aiming at improving vocal performance, outcome should be measured with a validated questionnaire such as the Voice Handicap Index (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1999</LINK>) and be blind for researchers and care-providers. To be able to better judge the outcome, research is needed to determine a clinically relevant change on these questionnaires. Even though trans-nasal flexible laryngoscopy (TFL) assisted treatment was not more effective than a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy, it might be more efficient. This should be studied in an economic evaluation.</P>
