<P>Tinnitus can be described as the experience of sound in the ear or in the head. Subjective tinnitus is not heard by anyone else. At present no particular treatment for tinnitus has been found effective in all patients.</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy was originally developed as a treatment for depression and then also used for anxiety, insomnia and chronic pain. It is a form of psychological treatment that uses relaxation, remodelling thoughts and challenging situations to improve the patient's attitude towards tinnitus.</P>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess whether cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in the management of patients suffering from tinnitus.</P>
<P>Eight trials (468 participants) are included in this review. Data analysis did not demonstrate any significant effect in the subjective loudness of tinnitus. We found, however, a significant improvement in the depression associated with tinnitus and quality of life (decrease of global tinnitus severity), suggesting that cognitive behavioural therapy has a positive effect on the way in which people cope with tinnitus.</P>
<P>Further research should use a limited number of validated questionnaires in a more consistent way and with a longer follow up to assess the long-term effect of cognitive behavioural therapy in patients with tinnitus.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in Issue 1, 2007 of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>This is one of a number of tinnitus reviews produced by the Cochrane Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Disorders Group, which use a standard Background. The following paragraphs ('Description of the condition') are based on earlier work in the following reviews and reproduced with permission: <LINK REF="REF-Baldo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2010</LINK>.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-07-30 11:42:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. For the patient it may be trivial or it may be a debilitating condition (<LINK REF="REF-Luxon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luxon 1993</LINK>). The quality of the perceived sound can vary enormously from simple sounds such as whistling or humming to complex sounds such as music. The patient may hear a single sound or multiple sounds. Tinnitus may be perceived in one or both ears, within the head or outside the body. The symptom may be continuous or intermittent. Tinnitus is described in most cases as subjective - meaning that it cannot be heard by anyone other than the patient. While, for the patient, this perception of noise is very real, because there is no corresponding external sound it can be considered a phantom, or false, perception. Objective tinnitus is a form of tinnitus which can be detected by an examiner, either unaided or using a listening aid such as a stethoscope or microphone in the ear canal. This is much less common and usually has a definable cause, such as sound generated by blood flow in or around the ear or unusual activity of the tiny muscles within the middle ear. Tinnitus may be associated with normal hearing or any degree of hearing loss and can occur at any age.</P>
<P>It is important to distinguish between clinically significant and non-significant tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK>) and several different classifications have been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Dauman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 1991</LINK>). Dauman, for example, makes a distinction between 'normal' (lasting less than five minutes, occurring less than once a week and experienced by most people) and 'pathological' tinnitus (lasting more than five minutes, occurring more than once a week and usually experienced by people with hearing loss).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Almost any form of disorder involving the outer, middle or inner ear or the auditory nerve may be associated with tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Brummett-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brummett 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1981</LINK>). However, it is possible to have severe tinnitus with no evidence of any aural pathology. Conversely, tinnitus can even exist without a peripheral auditory system: unilateral tinnitus is a common presenting symptom of vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), which are rare benign tumours of the vestibulo-cochlear nerve. When these neuromas are removed by a translabyrinthine route, the cochlear nerve can be severed. Despite the effective removal of their peripheral auditory mechanisms, 60% of these patients retain their tinnitus postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Baguley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baguley 1992</LINK>). This suggests the fundamental importance of the central auditory pathways in the maintenance of the symptom, irrespective of trigger.</P>
<P>Many environmental factors can also cause tinnitus. The most relevant and frequently reported are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>acute acoustic trauma (AAT) (for example, explosions or gunfire) (<LINK REF="REF-Christiansson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christiansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melinek-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melinek 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mrena-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mrena 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temmel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temmel 1999</LINK>);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>Over 50 years ago, Heller and Bergman demonstrated that if 'normal' people (with no known cochlear disease) were placed in a quiet enough environment, the vast majority of them would experience sounds inside their head. They concluded that tinnitus-like activity is a natural phenomenon perceived by many in a quiet enough environment (<LINK REF="REF-Heller-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 1953</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mazurek has shown that pathologic changes in the cochlear neurotransmission, e.g. as a result of intensive noise exposure or ototoxic drugs, can be a factor in the development of tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Mazurek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazurek 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 'neurophysiological model' of tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Jastreboff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jastreboff 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jastreboff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jastreboff 2004</LINK>) it is proposed that tinnitus results from the abnormal processing of a signal generated in the auditory system. This abnormal processing occurs before the signal is perceived centrally. This may result in 'feedback', whereby the annoyance created by the tinnitus causes the individual to focus increasingly on the noise, which in turn exacerbates the annoyance and so a 'vicious cycle' develops. In this model tinnitus could therefore result from continuous firing of cochlear fibres to the brain, from hyperactivity of cochlear hair cells or from permanent damage to these cells being translated neuronally into a 'phantom' sound-like signal that the brain 'believes' it is hearing. For this reason tinnitus may be compared to chronic pain of central origin - a sort of 'auditory pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Briner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briner 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relationship between the symptom of tinnitus and the activity of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system has been emphasised. The limbic system mediates emotions. It can be of great importance in understanding why the sensation of tinnitus is in many cases so distressing for the patient. It also suggests why, when symptoms are severe, tinnitus can be associated with major depression, anxiety and other psychosomatic and/or psychological disturbances, leading to a progressive deterioration of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1993</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Epidemiological data reports are few. The largest single study was undertaken in the UK by the Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research and was published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK>). This longitudinal study of hearing questioned 48,313 people; 10.1% described tinnitus arising spontaneously and lasting for five or more minutes at a time and 5% described it as moderately or severely annoying. However, only 0.5% reported tinnitus having a severe effect on their life. This is another of the paradoxes of tinnitus: the symptom is very common but the majority of people who experience it are not particularly concerned by it. These figures from the UK are broadly consistent with data collected by the American Tinnitus Association (ATA) which suggests that tinnitus may be experienced by around 50 million Americans, or 17% of the US population (<LINK REF="REF-ATA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATA 2004</LINK>). Data also exist for Japan, Europe and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Sindhusake-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindhusake 2003</LINK>), and estimates suggest that tinnitus affects a similar percentage of these populations, with 1% to 2 % experiencing debilitating tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Seidman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidman 1998</LINK>). The Oregon Tinnitus Data Archive (<LINK REF="REF-Oregon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oregon 1995</LINK>) contains data on the characteristics of tinnitus drawn from a sample of 1630 tinnitus patients. The age groups with the greater prevalence are those between 40 and 49 years (23.9%) and between 50 and 59 years (25.6%).</P>
<P>Olszewski showed in his study that the risk of tinnitus increases in patients over 55 years old who suffer from metabolic conditions and cervical spondylosis (<LINK REF="REF-Olszewski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olszewski 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Firstly a patient with tinnitus may undergo a basic clinical assessment. This will include the relevant otological, general and family history, and an examination focusing on the ears, teeth and neck and scalp musculature. Referral to a specialist is likely to involve a variety of other investigations including audiological tests and radiology. Persistent, unilateral tinnitus may be due to a specific disorder of the auditory pathway and imaging of the cerebellopontine angle is important to exclude, for example, a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) - a rare benign tumour of the cochleo-vestibular nerve. Other lesions, such as glomus tumours, meningiomas, adenomas, vascular lesions or neuro-vascular conflicts may also be detected by imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. Many patients who complain of tinnitus, and also have a significant hearing impairment, will benefit from a hearing aid. Not only will this help their hearing disability but the severity of their tinnitus may be reduced.</P>
<P>A wide range of therapies have been proposed for the treatment of tinnitus symptoms. Pharmacological interventions used include cortisone (<LINK REF="REF-Koester-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koester 2004</LINK>), vasodilators, benzodiazepines, lidocaine and spasmolytic drugs. The use of anticonvulsants in treating tinnitus is the subject of a forthcoming Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Hoekstra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoekstra 2009</LINK>). Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for tinnitus. However, two reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Baldo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2007</LINK>) showed that there is no indication that tricyclic antidepressants have a beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Although a number of studies have suggested that Ginkgo biloba may be of benefit in the treatment of tinnitus (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holger 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rejali-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rejali 2004</LINK>), a Cochrane Review showed that there was no evidence that it is effective where tinnitus was the primary complaint (<LINK REF="REF-Hilton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilton 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can improve oxygen supply to the inner ear which it is suggested may result in an improvement in tinnitus, however a Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to support this (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other options for the management of patients with tinnitus include transcranial magnetic stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 2009</LINK>), tinnitus masking (use of 'white noise' generators) (<LINK REF="REF-Hobson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobson 2007</LINK>), music therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Argstatter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argstatter 2008</LINK>), reflexology, hypnotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) including acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-30 11:42:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a structured, time-limited psychological therapy. It is usually offered on an outpatient basis with between eight and 24 weekly sessions. It involves the patient using behavioural and cognitive tasks to modify their response to thoughts and situations.</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy is based on the principle that core beliefs, usually developed in childhood and often arising from a specific incident, provide a pattern of assumptions. Specific mood states or events similar to the original or critical incident can set up thought patterns which reinforce the core beliefs. These patterns influence behavioural and emotional responses giving rise to symptoms, which may be cognitive, behavioural or somatic.</P>
<P>Tinnitus may be conceived as a failure to adapt to a stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Hallam-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallam 1984</LINK>) and in that sense may be considered to be analogous to anxiety states.</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy involves collaborative empiricism (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>) in which patient and therapist view the patient's fearful thoughts as hypotheses to be critically examined and tested. This is achieved by (a) generating an understanding of the link between thoughts and feelings arising from an event and using this information to understand the core beliefs and (b) modifying these cognitions and the behavioural and cognitive responses by which they are normally maintained. Education, discussion of evidence for and against the beliefs, imagery modification, attentional manipulations, exposure to feared stimuli and relaxation techniques are used in the therapy. Behavioural and cognitive assignments which test beliefs are used. The potential pitfalls and obstacles are identified and achievable goals are set so that a successful and therefore therapeutic outcome is experienced.</P>
<P>Originally developed as a treatment for depression, there are now a wide range of psychological conditions for which cognitive behavioural therapy has an evidence-based rationale including anxiety, insomnia and chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hawton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawton 1989</LINK>). The use of relaxation, cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and exposure to exacerbating situations in order to promote habituation may benefit tinnitus patients, as may the treatment of associated psychological conditions.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-16 13:45:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The criteria for quality assessment were based on the recommendations of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, version 4.2.1, Section 6 (updated December 2003). We assessed the quality of selected studies for the following characteristics:</P>
<P>Adequacy of the randomisation process and of allocation concealment:<BR/>A - adequate (e.g. centralised randomisation by a central office);<BR/>B - unclear (e.g. apparently adequate concealment but without other information in trial);<BR/>C - inadequate (e.g. alterations in method or any allocation that could be potentially transparent).</P>
<P>Attrition bias:<BR/>A - adequate (trials where an intention-to-treat analysis is possible and drop-out rate was less than 20% in all groups);<BR/>B - unclear (trials where drop-out rate was more than 20% or great heterogeneity in drop-out rate between groups was observed);<BR/>C - inadequate (lack of reporting on drop-out rate and intention-to-treat analysis is not possible).</P>
<P>Detection bias:<BR/>Blinding of investigators who assessed the outcomes of interventions is relevant to this research, in that the outcome measures have great subjective components (severity of tinnitus and/or associated depression). For the purpose of this review, it was also important to evaluate the adequacy, the development and the standardisation of the questionnaires used in the trials. For this reason adequacy of studies was classified as:</P>
<P>A - adequate (trials in which blinding of investigators assessing outcomes was adequate; the utilisation of questionnaires was clearly shown; the questionnaires used were well-known and/or standardised);<BR/>B - unclear (trials in which blinding of investigators is not adequately described and/or the utilisation of questionnaires was not clearly shown; the questionnaires used were not well-known and/or not standardised);<BR/>C - inadequate (trials in which blinding of investigators was clearly not performed).</P>
<P>We graded studies A, B or C for their overall methodological quality. We used study quality in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-11-16 13:46:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Data analysis was by intention-to-treat. For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and number needed to treat (NNT). For continuous data, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
<P>A pooled statistical analysis of treatment effects proceeded only in the absence of significant clinical or statistical heterogeneity. When obtaining the outcome of change we used the correlation obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Zachriat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zachriat 2004</LINK> (complete data set, correlation = 0.69) to model the outcomes for those studies that reported measures at baseline and endpoint only.</P>
<P>The main analysis was an examination of severity (subjective loudness) of tinnitus and its effect on depression and quality of life, during and after the period of treatment.</P>

<P>Twenty-seven studies were identified following our search, from which eight studies (comprising 468 participants) met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Most of the studies compared cognitive behavioural therapy to a waiting list control and/or other intervention/s, namely educational, yoga or other psychotherapeutic treatment, in two to four study arms. The assessment tools used in these studies varied greatly, but could be divided in three main groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>audiological;</LI>
<LI>psychometric questionnaires and well-being scales (such as Tinnitus Questionnaire and Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire); and</LI>
<LI>subjective score in a tinnitus diary (loudness, tinnitus awareness and tinnitus control etc.).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy treatment consisted of six to 11 group sessions (six to eight individuals) of 60 to 120 minutes duration, with a qualified psychologist or student psychologists under supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Rief-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rief 2005</LINK>) or the use of a self-help book and weekly therapist contact (<LINK REF="STD-Kaldo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaldo 2007</LINK>). Self-report questionnaires and diaries (between eight and 12) were used to measure outcomes at pre-, post-treatment and follow-up periods (i.e. three, six, 12 and 18/21 months). Reporting of patients lost during treatment and follow up was good with total drop-out varying from 4.65% to 21.66%, which would be more than adequate for these types of trials.</P>
<P>All studies aimed to report results at baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and at follow-up periods that varied from three to 18 months, however after the initial treatment, the waiting list groups also received CBT thus invalidating any further follow-up comparisons for the purpose of this review. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00f6_ner_x002d_Herwig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kröner-Herwig 2003</LINK>) collected follow-up data on the treatment group only (CBT) as their hypothesis was that the treatment effect would be maintained. In this trial, the authors claim that the improvement on the Tinnitus Questionnaire score (quality of life) was maintained at six months and deteriorated slightly but not significantly at 12 months follow up.</P>
<P>As there were no data in the comparison group in this study and because of the reasons mentioned above for the rest of the studies there are no long-term follow-up results available to compare in this review.</P>

Allocation concealment was adequate in most studies, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00f6_ner_x002d_Herwig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kröner-Herwig 1995</LINK>) divided the treatment group into two arms to have a more balanced four-arm study (comparing them to yoga and waiting list control), however this was taken into account when extracting data from this study, using a combined mean and standard deviations.</P>
<P>The inclusion/exclusion criteria were clearly defined in all studies. The participants' demographics were comparable throughout all the studies with the exception of a male preponderance (86%) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Eight trials comprising 468 participants were included in this review.</P>
<P>We established in our protocol that there would be a primary outcome measure: (1) subjective tinnitus loudness, and two secondary outcome measures: (2) subjective and objective improvement of the symptoms of depression and mood disturbances associated with tinnitus, and (3) evaluation of quality of life for patients (Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire or other validated assessment method).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-30 11:44:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in the management of patients suffering from tinnitus. As tinnitus itself is usually a subjective experience, our aim throughout the review was to look at subjective improvement in tinnitus and its effect on mood (depression) and overall quality of life.</P>
<P>We chose reduction in tinnitus loudness as our primary outcome as this is the principal goal patients are seeking and it is the eventual aim of many clinical interventions.</P>
<P>A large number of assessment tools (eight to 12) were used in each individual trial, so they generated an even larger list of outcome variables when some subsections of questionnaires or diaries were analysed independently. We used the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ; <LINK REF="REF-Hallam-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallam 1988</LINK>) and the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ; <LINK REF="REF-Kuk-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuk 1990</LINK>) as standardised and validated instruments to measure global tinnitus severity and its effect on quality of life, and the also validated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1988</LINK> and when not available, the validated Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D, German translation ADS, <LINK REF="REF-Radloff-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radloff 1977</LINK>, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - depression (HADS - depression; <LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>) and the Depression scale ("Depressivitäts Skala", <LINK REF="REF-Zerssen-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerssen 1975</LINK>), to provide a measure of depression in participants before and after their intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tinnitus loudness</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review has found evidence that CBT is unlikely to be effective in improving subjective tinnitus loudness. We feel this is principally because CBT is unlikely to have an effect on any of the postulated pathophysiological causes of tinnitus (e.g. cochlear neurotransmission, central auditory neural pathway). We did not expect to find any effect of behavioural treatment on subjective tinnitus loudness. The aim of behavioural treatment for tinnitus is not to reduce tinnitus loudness but to modify one of three response systems (behaviour, cognition and physiological reactivity) as suggested by the Jastreboff neurophysiological model.</P>
<P>In the absence of a 'cure' for any particular symptom, the role of any health intervention is to improve the patient&#8217;s overall condition. In this regard any improvement in quality of life or depression scores in someone who suffers from tinnitus may be considered to be an effective treatment. We found a significant improvement in the scores for both depression and quality of life (decrease of global tinnitus severity) of the participants, suggesting that CBT contributes positively to the management of tinnitus. This effect was observed for comparisons of CBT versus waiting list group (depression) and comparisons of CBT versus waiting list and versus other interventions (quality of life).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Depression</HEADING>
<P>The inclusion of more studies in this updated review has reduced the uncertainty around the estimated effect of CBT on depression associated with tinnitus. The authors of two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00f6_ner_x002d_Herwig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kröner-Herwig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weise 2008</LINK>) that used depression as study tools found no significant intra- and inter-group changes, with low baseline scores in the depression scales. The authors believe this left little room for improvement and subsequently the treatment had little overall effect. However, the inclusion of additional trials in the update of this review demonstrates that although the overall effect size is maintained (from SMD 0.29 to 0.37), the confidence intervals have considerably narrowed thus causing the effect to become significant.</P>
<P>In our previous review we argued that depression was mainly a significant co-morbidity in the subgroup of 'severe' tinnitus sufferers and that as these patients are a small proportion of tinnitus sufferers this could explain the failure of these trials to show any overall significant effect of CBT on tinnitus. However, the pooled results in this update now show that there is a clear improvement in the depression scores of tinnitus sufferers in general, supporting the conclusions of other authors who have found CBT to be consistently effective in the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Gelder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelder 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of all the trials included in this review only two (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaldo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaldo 2007</LINK>) made clear the exclusion criteria for patients with a high score on the depression scales (BDI &gt; 22, or score of &gt; 2 for the 'hopelessness' or 'suicidal ideation' question in <LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2005</LINK>; HADS-Anxiety or Depression subscales score &gt; 18 in <LINK REF="STD-Kaldo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaldo 2007</LINK>). This could introduce bias in the selection process so we performed a sensitivity analysis, removing these two studies from the meta-analysis of the pooled data. The result was the same significant positive effect on depression score when CBT was compared to no treatment (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.54, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). These two studies were not involved in the comparison between CBT and other interventions.</P>
<P>Could our findings suggest anything other than an effect of CBT on depression scales in people with tinnitus? This may well be the case, but if patients are subjectively improved by an intervention then the intervention is likely to be in their interest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>For quality of life, the overall effect of CBT compared to waiting list control group is significantly larger. There is a clinically significant improvement in the sensation of well-being. It must be noted, however, that the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Weise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weise 2008</LINK> trial, which is larger than the other trials and also uses CBT plus biofeedback together in the treatment group, potentially had an added effect on the overall pooled result. This trial has an impact on the heterogeneity of the results of CBT versus waiting list group on quality of life (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%). For this reason there is uncertainty about the size of the overall effect on quality of life, although it appears to be positive. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Weise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weise 2008</LINK> from the meta-analysis shows that the overall effect on depression and quality of life remains unaffected: still significant and in the same direction (depression: SMD 0.38 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.65, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%); quality of life: SMD 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.03, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

<P>In this 2010 update of the review we have increased the number of included trials from six to eight, providing us with enough information to fulfil our review objective.</P>
<P>The participants invited to take part in these studies were recruited from the general population through newspaper, internet or other media adverts (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00f6_ner_x002d_Herwig-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kröner-Herwig 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00f6_ner_x002d_Herwig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kröner-Herwig 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weise-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weise 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zachriat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zachriat 2004</LINK>), attending the outpatient department (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>) or a combination of both methods (<LINK REF="STD-Kaldo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaldo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rief-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rief 2005</LINK>). These participants were homogeneously distributed between the different groups of the studies and, with respect to age, sex and the various degrees of severity of both tinnitus and depression associated with tinnitus, could be considered to be representative of the typical patient that attends an outpatient clinic.</P>
<P>It was impossible to analyse long-term follow up in this review as in all trials that use waiting list control groups, the participants in these groups end up receiving the same treatment after the initial waiting period. This prevents us from drawing any conclusions about the long-term effect of CBT for tinnitus.</P>
