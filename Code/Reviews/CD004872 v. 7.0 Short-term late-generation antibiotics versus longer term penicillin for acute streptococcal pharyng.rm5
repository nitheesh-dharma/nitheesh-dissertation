<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-30 06:57:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Streptococcal (strep) throat infection is very common. A 10-day course of penicillin is prescribed mainly to protect against the complication of acute rheumatic fever, which can occur approximately 20 days after streptococcal throat and cause damage to the heart valves. Cases of acute rheumatic fever have dropped dramatically in high-income countries. Newer antibiotics taken for a shorter duration, may have a comparable effect to penicillin taken for 10 days.</P>
<P>We summarized medical literature regarding the effect of two to six days of oral antibiotics (short duration) in treating children with streptococcal throat infection, compared with 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration). We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis. The short duration treatment resulted in better compliance but more side effects. All side effects were self-limiting: mostly mild to moderate diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Three studies reported the rate of long duration complications with no statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 3 out of the 20 included studies followed the participants for a sufficient duration to be able to study the prevalence of complications of GABHS pharyngitis. Although these three studies had a total of 8135 participants, results were too under-powered to draw any conclusions on differences in complication rates. This means our conclusion is not applicable in low-income countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is high. Another limitation is that the primary studies evaluated different antibiotics for variable durations (three to six days). Also, studies were of limited quality. Finally, although the shorter antibiotic duration appeared to be effective and more convenient, it is more expensive than the standard duration 10 days of penicillin. However, one must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy.</P>
<P>Three to six days of oral antibiotics for children with streptococcal throat infection is a safe treatment with a comparable effect to the standard duration of 10 days of penicillin. However, our results must be interpreted with caution in low-income countries where acute rheumatic fever is still a problem.</P>

<P>We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long-term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-30 06:47:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-15 14:41:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Sore throat is one of the most common symptoms that primary health care physicians have to deal with (<LINK REF="REF-Nandi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nandi 2001</LINK>) and group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause. Fifty per cent of cases are in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Bisno-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisno 1997</LINK>). Although patients recover without antibiotic therapy, treatment is sometimes advised to hasten clinical resolution, prevent suppurative sequelae and decrease the incidence of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Bisno-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisno 1997</LINK>). Rheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated group A streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and leads to pancarditis (inflammation of the heart layers). Chronic rheumatic heart disease leads to cardinal anatomic changes of the valve including leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-29 19:13:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treating GABHS pharyngitis, including penicillin and its congeners (such as ampicillin, amoxicillin and semi-synthetic penicillins) as well as many cephalosporins, macrolides and clindamycin (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004872.pub2/full#CD004872-bbs2-0027">Bisno 1997</A>). Penicillin is often chosen because of its proven efficacy, safety, narrow spectrum and low cost. Oral penicillin for 10 days is still recommended as standard of care, because of past concern for maximum protection against acute rheumatic fever (the principal and original reason for using antibiotics for sore throat). However, a shorter duration of newer antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, has been shown to have comparable efficacy and has the advantage of overcoming beta lactamase producing organisms, as well as a longer half life, as with azithromycin. The incorporation of potentially more costly treatments in the era of health care reform must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-03-30 06:47:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is difficult to comply with a 10-day antibiotic course. If we summarize the available evidence and show that a short duration antibiotic course is efficacious in treating GABHS pharyngitis, this will make treatment much more convenient to the patient and will improve compliance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-23 16:56:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A 10-day course of antibiotics has variable patient compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>), possibly because symptomatic improvement is often achieved within 24 to 48 hours of starting therapy. Patient (or parent) motivation to complete the recommended 10 day duration of penicillin diminishes rapidly after two to three days. Greater convenience to patients may result in improved compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>); and reduced failure rate (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1997</LINK>), complications (<LINK REF="STD-Tack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1997</LINK>) and returns to the physician (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 2000a</LINK>); and overall cost (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1997</LINK>).</P>

The time to fever resolution was reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aujard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aujard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kafetzis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kafetzis 2004</LINK>). Both studies favored the short duration group. In the first study, the short duration group had a mean duration of fever of 2.04 days compared with 2.38 days in the standard duration group, while in the second study the durations were 2.82 days and 3.1 days, respectively (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.14) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Late clinical recurrence</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies assessed the risk of late clinical recurrence. The majority of the studies performed follow-up four weeks after completion of treatment, with a range from two weeks to one year in one study. The risk of late clinical recurrence was not statistically different between short duration and standard duration groups (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Bacterial eradication is important in order to reduce the chance of recurrence and GABHS complications, especially acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. All included studies assessed risk of early (1 to 10 days) bacteriological treatment failure.

The risk of late bacteriological recurrence was significantly worse in the short duration treatment groups (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48). However, when eliminating the studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg), which performed much worse than other short duration regimens (OR 3.62, 95% CI 2.66 to 4.92), the two treatment groups were no longer statistically different (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22).</P>

<P>Only three studies reported post-GABHS pharyngitis complications. In the <LINK REF="STD-Adam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 2000a</LINK> study, 5 out of 4482 participants with a 12-month follow-up period developed complications. In the short duration treatment group three participants developed acute rheumatic fever and one developed glomerulonephritis. In the standard duration treatment group one patient developed glomerulonephritis.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Schaad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schaad 2002</LINK> study, two participants in the short duration treatment group developed proteinuria or glomerulonephritis and six participants in the standard duration treatment group developed proteinuria and/or glomerulonephritis or reactive arthritis. These findings disappeared without treatment within one to three weeks.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Scholz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Scholz 2004</LINK> study, one patient in the standard duration treatment group developed glomerulonephritis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-30 06:57:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On a global scale, group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In low-income countries rheumatic fever remains an endemic disease with an annual incidence ranging from 100 to 200 per 100,000 school-aged children and is a major cause of cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Olivier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivier 2000</LINK>). The global burden of disease caused by GABHS is not known. A report by the Centre for International Child Health, University of Melbourne, reviewed recent population-based data in order to estimate the burden of GABHS diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Carapetis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carapetis 2005</LINK>). The report highlighted deficiencies in the available data and found that there are at least 517,000 deaths annually due to severe GABHS diseases (for example, acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and invasive infections). The prevalence of severe GABHS disease is at least 18.1 million cases, with 1.78 million new cases each year. The greatest burden is due to rheumatic heart disease, with a prevalence of at least 15.6 million cases, with 282,000 new cases and 233,000 deaths each year. The burden of invasive GABHS diseases is unexpectedly high, with at least 663,000 new cases and 163,000 deaths each year. The report states that there are more than 111 million prevalent cases of GABHS pyoderma and over 616 million cases of GABHS pharyngitis per year.</P>
<P>The incidence of rheumatic fever has declined in high-income countries since the 1950s and now has an annual incidence of around 0.5 cases per 100,000 children of school age. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever in the United States, particularly over the past 50 years has decreased substantially. The reason for this is unclear. It has been proposed that certain M types of GABHS include strains that are particularly rheumatogenic and that others are non-rheumatogenic. <LINK REF="REF-Shulman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 2006</LINK> compared the M type distribution of GABHS recovered from children in Chicago, Illinois with acute pharyngitis between 1961 and 1968 to that of GABHS recovered from Chicago children and children from across the United States between 2000 and 2004, with attention to changes in M types that were previously associated with rheumatogenic strains. Shulman found rheumatogenic types comprised 49.7% of 468 pharyngeal isolates between 1961 and 1968 but only 10.6% of 450 Chicago isolates and 17.9% of 3969 isolates nationwide between 2000 and 2004 (P &lt; 0.001). These data support the concept of rheumatogenic strains of GABHS and indicate that the marked decrease in the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in the United States over the past four decades is correlated with the replacement of rheumatogenic types by non-rheumatogenic types in cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis in children. The reasons underlying the observed change in distribution of M types remain to be explained (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard duration 10 days of penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis is difficult to comply with. We have shown in this systematic review that a short duration (three to six days) of oral antibiotics has comparable efficacy to the standard 10-day duration of oral penicillin. The two regimes showed comparable results, including time to resolution of fever and sore throat, risk of early clinical and bacteriological treatment failure, late clinical and bacteriological recurrence and risk of complications. The short duration treatment was superior with regard to compliance. Low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg/day) for three days was significantly inferior to standard duration treatment and other short duration treatments with regard to bacteriological eradication. There were more side effects with the short duration treatment, however, all were self-limiting and mainly mild to moderate vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.</P>
<P>We were struck by the wide range of antibiotic regimens studied. Fourteen different antibiotic regimens were tried in the 20 studies that met our inclusion criteria. In addition, short duration treatment included regimens as brief as three days.</P>
<P>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 3 out of the 20 included studies followed the participants for a sufficient duration to be able to study the prevalence of complications of acute GABHS pharyngitis (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schaad 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Scholz 2004</LINK>). Although these three studies had a total of 8135 participants, results were too under-powered to draw any conclusions on differences in complication rates. This means our conclusion is not applicable in low-income countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is high. Another limitation is that the primary studies were heterogeneous. They studied different antibiotics for variable durations (three to six days). Also, studies had limited quality. Finally, although the shorter antibiotic duration appeared to be effective and more convenient, it is more expensive than the standard duration 10 days of penicillin. However, one must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-16 12:06:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment had shorter periods of fever and throat soreness and lower risk of early clinical treatment failure. There was no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure, or late clinical recurrence, however, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment group, although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg) were eliminated. Three studies reported long duration complications with no statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>The outstanding uncertainty is in the difference of the risk of late complications. In areas where the risk of rheumatic heart disease is high, the risk may outweigh the benefit of improved convenience and compliance with short duration antibiotics.</P>

<P>Large, international blinded randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up for at least 12 months will be very valuable to compare the difference in complication rates between short duration and standard duration antibiotic regimes in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of three to six days of newer antibiotic therapy was comparable to that of the standard 10 days of penicillin; a regimen that has a high non-compliance rate.</P>

<P>We found most articles using a unified terminology for the late clinical and bacteriological outcomes, which was different to the terminology we initially used in the protocol. We used &#8220;late clinical and bacteriological failure&#8221;, while most studies used &#8220;late clinical and bacteriological recurrence&#8221;, which is a more accurate term, since failure was defined mostly as &#8220;persistence after treatment&#8221; while recurrence is &#8220;return of the initial clinical or bacteriological infection after an initial resolution&#8221;. We felt that it would be more appropriate to adopt the same late outcome terminology used by most original studies: "late clinical and late bacteriological recurrence". This change of terminology on its own did not lead to a change in the outcome data, however, we removed the &#8220;recurrence&#8221; outcome, as it is now redundant.</P>
<P>In the protocol we planned to assess heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. However, due to the limited number of trials that assessed the same drug for short treatment we focused on the overall effect. In the <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> section we included the effect per drug for four subsets of studies based on the type of short duration antibiotic used: azithromycin 10 mg/kg, azithromycin 20 mg/kg, clarithromycin and cefuroxime.</P>
