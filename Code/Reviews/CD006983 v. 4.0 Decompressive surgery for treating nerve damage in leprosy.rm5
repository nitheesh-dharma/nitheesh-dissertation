<P>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease. Leprosy bacteria cause damage to skin and peripheral nerves which may result in nerve function impairment and disability. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage although its effect is uncertain. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review and examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Two years from the start there was very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between people treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. No additional trials were identified when searches were updated in 2010 and 2012. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone. Well-designed RCTs are needed to establish the effectiveness of the combination of surgery and medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacillus <I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>. Leprosy bacilli are spread in tiny droplets from the nose or mouth from infected and untreated individuals. When the immune system fails to respond effectively to the antigens of the bacilli, leprosy will develop. Leprosy bacilli may directly or indirectly cause damage. Often, the first sign of leprosy is a skin lesion. Damage to peripheral nerves may cause symptoms such as loss of sweating, sensation and muscle strength. Leprosy appears in various clinical forms, dependent on the response of the immune system. Some people have only a few skin lesions and the number of bacilli is relatively small. This is classified as paucibacillary (PB) leprosy. Other people may have many skin lesions with multiple nerves involved and a high number of bacilli in their body and are then classified as having multibacillary (MB) leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Leprosy can be effectively treated with a combination of antibiotics (rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine). Since the introduction of this multidrug therapy (MDT), the number of people with leprosy has decreased substantially. At the beginning of 2007 the reported prevalence was about 225,000 individuals worldwide. This is the registered number of people on MDT treatment. The number of newly detected people reported was approximately 259,000 in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>The body's immune response to the antigens of the leprosy bacilli may cause periods of inflammation in the skin and peripheral nerves and sometimes also in other organs: so-called 'reactions'. There are two types of potentially nerve damaging reactions: a type 1 or reversal reaction (RR) and a type 2 reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Reactions may occur before, during and after MDT and are the main cause of nerve damage and consequently of impairment in leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-ILEP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Nerve damage may develop slowly and is often unnoticed until very late. It is often the symptoms of a reaction that force people to seek medical help (<LINK REF="REF-Job-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Job 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Leprosy is a most important disabling disease. The World Health Organization estimated the number of people living with physical disabilities due to leprosy at two to three million worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>) in spite of the low official prevalence figure. Despite a fast declining trend in the number of newly detected people with leprosy, the decline in the number of people living with physical disabilities is much slower. In the near future, we can still expect about one million people to be affected by leprosy disability (<LINK REF="REF-Meima-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meima 2008</LINK>). People affected by leprosy, especially those with visible deformities and disabilities, fear discrimination and stigmatisation. These people may experience severe social and psychological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Heijnders-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijnders 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leekassa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leekassa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rafferty-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafferty 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids, especially prednisolone, are used as first-line treatment of severe reversal reactions and nerve damage in leprosy. They work by controlling the acute inflammation and relieving the pain (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2000</LINK>). The earlier corticosteroids are given after the onset of nerve damage, the more likely permanent nerve function impairment will be prevented (<LINK REF="REF-Becx_x002d_Bleumink-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becx-Bleumink 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naafs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 1996</LINK>). Prednisolone seems to be a very effective drug, but it has some shortcomings. Long-term therapy may cause serious adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer, cataract or psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Richardus-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugumaran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugumaran 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). A considerable proportion of people treated for severe reversal reactions and nerve damage does not benefit from standard corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schreuder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreuder 1998</LINK>). The long-term benefit of corticosteroids for treating nerve damage is still uncertain and trials establishing the optimal regimen and effectiveness are needed (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Veen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Veen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other immunosuppressant drugs for treating severe reversal reactions and nerve damage have been tested or are under examination, such as azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Marlowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlowe 2004</LINK>) and ciclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sena-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sena 2006</LINK>). It is plausible that these drugs may be effective for treating nerve damage, but evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is very limited.</P>
<P>Decompressive surgery or neurolysis as treatment for nerve damage has been used for several decades. The objective of this surgery is to relieve mechanical compression, due to oedema caused by neuritis, of the affected nerve. Decompression is done by incision of the thickened nerve sheath (epineurium) where the nerve is enlarged and often tender on palpation. This incision is often of a considerable length at the place before entering the fibro-osseous tunnel which, during surgery, also needs to be opened. Results from non-randomised studies of surgery have been widely published (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Brandsma-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandsma 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carayon-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Carayon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaise-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dandapat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dandapat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Droogenbroeck-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Droogenbroeck 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramarorazana-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramarorazana 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1989</LINK>), but there is little evidence from RCTs that surgery is better than medical treatment alone (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebenezer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenezer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pannikar-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pannikar 1984</LINK>). Decompressive surgery is not recommended without medical treatment. Indications for surgery are mainly based on common practice but are not well-defined. These may include the presence of nerve abscess, nerve pain or nerve function impairment that does not respond to medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Chaise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malaviya-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaviya 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palande-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palande 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Decompressive surgery is frequently used for treating nerve damage in leprosy. The effect of surgery, especially in the long term, is uncertain and it is unclear whether surgery is more beneficial than medical treatment alone. While this review focused on evidence from RCTs, it was expected that only a few RCTs would have been conducted in this area. Therefore, the results were also considered in the light of non-randomised evidence in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section.</P>

<P>1. Improvement in sensory nerve function one year after registration, as determined and defined by the original authors.</P>
<P>Sensory nerve function was assessed with five graded nylon filaments or a ball-point pen. We adapted the scores as defined by Van Brakel et al (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Brakel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Brakel 2005</LINK>). For testing with graded nylon filaments, sensory nerve function impairment was diagnosed if the monofilament threshold was increased from normal by three or more points for any nerve. One point was given for each level that the monofilament threshold was increased from normal at each test site. The points were added for each nerve. Normal thresholds used were 200 mg for the hand and 2 g for the foot. If the score for any nerve decreased by three or more points from the baseline score, the nerve was considered as improved. When a non-graded test was used, such as the ball-point pen test, a nerve was diagnosed as impaired if two or more test sites did not feel the stimulus. Improvement for any nerve was defined as two or more test sites feeling the stimulus, compared to the baseline measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Brakel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Brakel 2003</LINK>). Improvement was a dichotomous outcome variable (improvement or not).</P>
<P>2. Improvement in motor nerve function one year after registration, as determined and defined by the original authors.</P>
<P>Improvement in motor nerve function was assessed with the modified MRC grading scale (<LINK REF="REF-Brandsma-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandsma 1981</LINK>).

The end point closest to three months (one to six months) was used for short-term benefit and the end point closest to two years (± one year) was used for long-term benefit. The long-term data were considered the primary endpoint but we considered the short-term data in order to detect rapid onset of improvement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (NvV and JHR) checked the titles and abstracts identified from the searches. If it was clear that the study did not refer to a RCT of surgical decompression for treating nerve damage in leprosy, we excluded it. The same two review authors independently assessed the full text version of each remaining study to determine whether it met the pre-defined selection criteria. Any differences of opinion were resolved through discussion within the review team.

<UL>
<LI>the method of generation of the randomisation sequence;</LI>
<LI>the method of allocation concealment - considered 'adequate' if the assignment could not be foreseen;</LI>
<LI>whether participants, personnel and outcome assessors were blinded;</LI>

<P>The trial compared oral prednisolone plus medial epicondylectomy and external nerve decompression (surgery group) with oral prednisolone alone (medical group) in participants with ulnar neuritis of less than six months duration (n = 57 participants with 75 nerves). One year after admission results of sensory nerve function were available for 31 nerves in the surgery group and 31 nerves in the medical group. Improvement was measured as either a mean change score between baseline and end of follow-up or the proportion of nerves with improvement. Sensory testing was done with a No.3 and No.6 nylon thread (approximately 200 mg and 5 g, respectively). Fifteen sites on the ulnar nerve distribution area were tested. The score for each nerve depended on the number of sites felt. The score was 15 when all sites were felt with the 200 mg thread, and zero when no site was felt with either thread. Sensory improvement was defined as a positive difference between the final and initial score. Mean differences between the baseline score and the score at the end of one year were compared for the two treatment groups. Results were available for 29 nerves in the surgery group and 28 nerves in the medical group. After one year the mean difference was 2.08 (95% CI 0.28 to 3.88) in the surgery group and 2.00 (95% CI 0.06 to 3.94) in the medical group, indicating a mean improvement in both. The improvement was slightly greater in the surgery group but the mean difference 0.08 (95% CI -2.45 to 2.61) between the two groups was not significant (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

Results of motor nerve function were available for 31 nerves in the surgery group and 31 nerves in the medical group. Improvement was measured as either a change score between baseline and end of follow-up or as the proportion of nerves improved. Motor nerve function of the ulnar nerve was assessed with the MRC grading scale. The maximum score for each muscle was five and for the whole nerve 15. Motor improvement was defined as a positive difference between the final and initial score. Mean differences between the baseline score and the score at the end of one year were compared for the two treatment groups. Results were available for 29 nerves in the surgery group and 28 nerves in the medical group. After one year the mean difference was 3.08 (95% CI 2.12 to 4.04) in the surgery group and 2.26 (95% CI 0.21 to 4.31) in the medical group indicating a mean improvement in both.

<P>The trial compared oral prednisolone plus epineurotomy and external nerve decompression (surgery group) with oral prednisolone alone (medical group) in participants with neuritis of less than six months duration (n = 31 participants). The trial measured sensory nerve function improvement of ulnar, median and posterior tibial nerves and motor nerve function improvement of ulnar, median and common peroneal nerves two years after treatment. Results were available for 46 nerves in the surgery group and 47 nerves in the medical group. Improvement was measured as a change score between baseline and end of follow-up and converted into median improvement. For example, a median improvement of 25% means that 50% of the data had greater than 25% improvement and 50% of the data had less than 25% improvement. Sensory testing was done with five graded Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (50 mg, 200 mg, 2 g, 4 g, 10 g) and according to a protocol described by Pearson (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1982</LINK>).<I> </I>Sensory improvement was defined as a positive difference between the final and initial score.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>Decompressive surgery is frequently used in the management of nerve damage in leprosy, but evidence from RCTs for the effect of decompressive surgery is scarce.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability and quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Two RCTs were available for this review. One trial compared the added benefit of medial epicondylectomy over corticosteroids for participants with ulnar neuritis of less than six months duration (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenezer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenezer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pannikar-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pannikar 1984</LINK>). The other trial compared the added benefit of longitudinal epineurotomy over corticosteroids for participants with ulnar, median, common peroneal or posterior tibial nerve involvement of less than six months duration (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK>). The interventions and outcomes were too heterogeneous to be combined in a meta-analysis. The numbers of participants included in the trials were small and did not allow for subgroup analysis. The variability between studies and the limitations in study design and sample size made it difficult to draw any robust conclusions.</P>
<P>None of the trials found a significant difference in improved nerve function between surgery and medical groups after a follow-up of one or two years. This result may have been biased by the selection criteria used for inclusion of patients and nerves. Only a small proportion (about 10%) may benefit from decompressive surgery and show improvement after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Naafs-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naafs 2008</LINK>). The other nerves need no decompression. By taking all nerves together, results may be diluted and the conclusion clouded.</P>
<P>The two trials had some drawbacks. One major drawback of both trials was that they sometimes used more than one nerve from individual patients in the analyses thereby considering the outcomes from each nerve independently. The trial of Pannikar and Ebenezer included 18 patients with ulnar nerve damage on both sides (bilateral involvement). The right side was allocated to the group drawn by random selection and the left side was allocated to the other group. The final results reflect the outcomes of all nerves. No separate analysis was done using only one independent outcome from each patient. Original data were not available. <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK> included 31 patients with 93 nerves in total. It is unclear how many nerves each patient contributed. The final results reflect the outcomes of all nerves. No separate analysis was done using only one independent outcome from each patient. Original data were not available. The results from these studies should be treated with considerable caution, because results from a patient contributing outcomes from more than one nerve will be treated, in the analysis, as having more weight as a patient contributing only one nerve.</P>
<P>Other limitations of the Pannikar study were that randomisation was done by alternation, which is considered an inadequate randomisation procedure. With regard to loss to follow-up, 23% of the participants were lost to follow-up after one year and 32% after two years. No reasons for these losses were reported and no intention-to-treat analysis was performed.</P>
<P>The randomisation procedure and loss to follow-up (6%) were considered adequate in <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK>. Outcomes were expressed as median improvement. No numbers or original data were available to calculate mean differences or RRs making comparison and interpretation of the results difficult. Subgroup analyses showed no difference in median improvement between operated or non-operated nerves with respect to type of leprosy (lepromatous or non-lepromatous), type of antibacillary drug therapy (mono or multi), type of nerve function impairment (motor or sensory), and duration of neuritis (zero to three months or three to six months). There were significant differences for pain relief and severity of the neuritis before surgery. Operated nerves had higher median pain relief compared to non-operated nerves. In the group with considerable loss of nerve function the operated nerves had higher median improvement compared to non-operated nerves.</P>
<P>The occurrence of adverse effects was not adequately reported in the trials. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1999</LINK>) excluded a participant with haemorrhage during the course of the trial, but it was unclear whether this was due to the intervention. The literature reviewing decompressive surgery in leprosy often does not take adverse effects into account, but stresses the importance of having adequate techniques and instruments and competent surgeons to prevent unfavourable outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourrel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourrel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 2004</LINK>). Complications of decompressive surgery in general may be painful scars, wound problems, haematoma, infection and damage to nerves, arteries or tendons (<LINK REF="REF-Malaviya-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaviya 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoma 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the trials included quality of life measures or cost-effectiveness calculations which could be useful indicators of the effectiveness of interventions.</P>

<P>Many published and unpublished non-randomised studies have examined the effect of decompressive surgery for treating nerve damage in leprosy. While the two RCTs give insufficient evidence in favour of decompressive surgery in addition to steroid treatment, most non-randomised studies report beneficial effects of decompressive surgery. Relief of nerve pain and tenderness is the most frequently and consistently reported benefit. Nerve function improvement is frequently reported, but the response to surgery seems to depend on several factors, such as severity and duration of neuritis before surgery, the type of leprosy, the nerve involved and the surgical technique used. Nerves which are partially damaged, have neuritis of less than six months duration and are associated with multibacillary (MB) leprosy show better results (<LINK REF="REF-Chaise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malaviya-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaviya 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palande-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palande 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandya-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandya 1983</LINK>). Studies examining the effects of surgery reported sensory improvement varying from about 38% to 97% and motor improvement varying from about 26% to 63% (<LINK REF="REF-Antia-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antia 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brandsma-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandsma 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaise-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaise-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaise-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaise 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Husain-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Husain-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malaviya-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaviya 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palande-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palande 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandya-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandya 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramarorazana-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramarorazana 1995</LINK>). Comparison of these studies is difficult due to differences in surgical techniques used, duration and severity of neuritis, type of leprosy, follow-up time, and outcome measures.</P>
<P>Several non-randomised studies compared operated versus non-operated nerves. One study evaluated nerve function in nine individuals with neuritis of less than six months duration.Three patients underwent ulnar nerve decompression, three patients received corticosteroid therapy for ulnar neuritis and three patients underwent median nerve decompression. The study found an average nerve function improvement of 35% for ulnar nerve decompression (n = 3), 32% for steroid treatment of eight weeks (n = 3) and 18%, for median nerve decompression (n = 3) six months after surgery or start of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies examined surgery alone versus surgery plus steroids. One study compared medial epicondylectomy alone (n = 7) with medial epicondylectomy plus steroids (n = 7) given two weeks postoperatively for ulnar neuritis of less than one month's duration. After a five-month follow-up motor improvement was not better in the group receiving additional steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Oommen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Oommen 1979</LINK>). Another study compared neurolysis (n = 21) with neurolysis in combination with perineural corticosteroid injections (n = 18) for ulnar neuritis of less than six months duration. The injections were administered around the thickened nerve after surgery and two and three weeks later. One year after surgery the mean difference between final and initial nerve function score was 14 for the surgery only group and 21 for the surgery plus steroids group (<LINK REF="STD-Dandapat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dandapat 1991</LINK>). The third study compared decompressive surgery alone (n = 59) with surgery plus steroids (n = 25) given for three to four months for sensory impairment of the posterior tibial nerve of varying duration. Satisfactory recovery of nerves with duration of anaesthesia of less than six months was 61% in the surgery group and 83% in the surgery plus steroids group four weeks after surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study compared operated nerves with contralateral non-operated nerves. Prior to surgery all participants had received three months of steroid treatment. The most affected nerves underwent surgical decompression and were compared with the contralateral non-operated nerves one year or more after surgery. Of the more than 100 nerve decompressions four operated nerves had decreased nerve function after one year of follow-up. The other operated nerves had unchanged or improved nerve function one year after surgery. It is unclear how many of the contralateral non-operated nerves improved or deteriorated (<LINK REF="STD-Droogenbroeck-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Droogenbroeck 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>After losses to follow-up, another study compared operated nerves (n = 195) of 95 patients with non-operated nerves of 96 patients, matched for type of leprosy, age and duration of sensory loss but not randomised, on changes in sensation. Participants in whom no improvement of sensory nerve function was found after a standard steroid treatment (40 mg prednisolone daily for three weeks after which the dosage was reduced by 5 mg per week) were included in the study. Between 27% and 66% of the nerves had definite improvement two years after surgery compared to 7% of the non-operated nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Theuvenet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theuvenet 2006</LINK>). Improvement was more likely if the sensory loss had been present for a shorter time.</P>
<P>Studies from Carayon et al favour surgery plus medical treatment above medical treatment alone (<LINK REF="STD-Carayon-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Carayon 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carayon-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Carayon 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carayon-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Carayon 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management in acute nerve damage in leprosy, are recommended by the WHO and are widely available. But corticosteroids have some shortcomings. The effects of corticosteroids in the long term remain uncertain and a considerable proportion of people treated for nerve damage do not benefit from corticosteroid treatment. Long-term therapy may cause serious adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer, cataract or psychosis. Spontaneous improvement or recovery of nerve function in untreated or placebo treated individuals has been reported and needs more investigation. The limitations of corticosteroids urge the need to find alternative therapeutic approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Veen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Veen 2007</LINK>). Surgery alone as therapy for treating neuritis is not recommended, but there is discussion about whether the combination of surgery and medical treatment (e.g. steroids) will give better results than medical treatment alone and there is a call for appropriate trials examining this question (<LINK REF="REF-Bourrel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourrel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malaviya-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malaviya 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 2004</LINK> ).<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-08 15:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Very low quality evidence from the two RCTs is insufficient to draw robust conclusions about the effect of decompressive surgery for treating nerve damage in leprosy. Two trials examining the added benefit of surgery over steroids for neuritis of less than six months duration did not show significantly better outcomes with steroids plus surgery than steroids alone in the long term. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery for treating nerve damage in leprosy are not well documented.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-08 15:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There is a need to identify factors which will predict a favourable response to decompressive surgery or groups of patients or nerves that will be likely to benefit from surgery. Future RCTs should be well-designed to establish the usefulness and effectiveness of the combination of decompressive surgery and medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone. New trials should pay more attention to non-clinical aspects, such as costs and impact on quality of life, because these are highly relevant indicators for both policy makers and participants.</P>
