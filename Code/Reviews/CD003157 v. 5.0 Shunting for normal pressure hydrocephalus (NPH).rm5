<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt to remove fluid is effective in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but potentially treatable cause of dementia. Since the condition was first described in 1965, it has conventionally been treated by placement of a shunt to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain. No trial has yet compared the placement of a shunt versus no shunt in a randomized controlled manner. Nor have the long-term outcomes of treated and untreated normal pressure hydrocephalus been compared. There is, therefore, no evidence for the use of shunts in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-04 11:31:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) (<LINK REF="REF-Hakim-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 1965</LINK>) is a rare but potentially treatable cause of dementia. The clinical triad is the presence of dementia, difficulty with gait (in particular, a tendency to walk with short steps), and urinary incontinence. These features occur in many other dementias but in NPH, radiological imaging of the brain shows the presence of enlarged ventricles with relative preservation of the cerebral cortex. The cerebrospinal fluid which surrounds the brain is contained within a membrane called the arachnoid. The fluid is continually produced from a collection of blood vessels lying in the cerebral ventricles (cavities within the brain) and then flows over the surface of the brain and is reabsorbed back into the veins within the skull through tiny projections of the arachnoid into the veins, known as arachnoid granulations. It is currently believed that in NPH there is a failure of reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid through the arachnoid granulations. This may occur as a consequence of previous infection or haemorrhage in the subarachnoid space, but in many cases it is due to thickening of the arachnoid membrane, idiopathic fibrosing meningitis, which is a condition of unknown cause. Whatever the underlying cause, a pressure gradient builds up between the intraventricular system and the fluid surrounding the brain surface. Eventually, CSF formation diminishes so that a stable state is reached but the CSF pressure is reset at a high normal level, or with intermittent waves of high pressure. The increased pressure is thought to be the cause of damage to nerve cells and tracts in the brain.</P>
<P>Treatment is based upon the presumption that provision of a CSF diversion device from the ventricles will lead to normalization of the pressure difference and thereby to stability or improvement in symptoms and signs. The CSF is drained through a tube (shunt) from the brain ventricles either directly into the blood stream in the heart or into the peritoneal space surrounding the abdominal organs, where it is reabsorbed into the blood. This form of treatment is currently accepted practice in cases of obstructive hydrocephalus where there is blockage of CSF flow from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space surrounding the cerebrum. Insertion of a permanent CSF diversion device requires an operative procedure under general anaesthesia. The procedure can only be performed by a trained surgeon. Possible adverse outcomes can include operative complications such as bleeding or infection of the shunt or wound site, failure of the shunt due to blockage or breakage of the shunt tubing, and over-shunting resulting in a low pressure state with headache, ventricular shrinkage and the development of subdural fluid accumulations.</P>
<P>A recognised difficulty is the confirmation of the diagnosis and selection of those patients who will benefit from the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1997</LINK>). A diagnosis is often suspected when the typical clinical triad is combined with the radiological finding of ventricles enlarged disproportionately to the degree of cerebral atrophy. Additional methods used have included: monitoring of CSF pressure over prolonged periods to detect intermittent rises in pressure above normal (the A waves of Lundberg); responses of CSF pressure to subarachnoid infusions of normal saline (saline is injected by means of a lumbar puncture into the CSF lying beneath the arachnoid membrane); radionucleotide cisternography (a radioactive liquid is injected via lumbar puncture into the subarachnoid space) showing reflux into the ventricles with delayed pericerebral diffusion; and drainage of large amounts of CSF with observation for detecting signs of temporary clinical improvement.</P>

<P>To determine the effectiveness of shunting procedures in promoting stability or improvement in the neurological symptoms and signs of NPH.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials involving permanent shunt procedures in NPH.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>As there are no formalized diagnostic criteria, participants considered to have the clinical features of NPH (dementia, gait dyspraxia, and incontinence) and radiological signs (ventricular enlargement disproportionate to the degree of cerebral atrophy), and to have had other possible causes of dementia ruled out, will be included. Exclusion criteria would include the finding of an alternative cause for the clinical features or the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus. </P>

<P>Implantation of permanent ventriculo-peritoneal or ventriculo-atrial CSF shunts.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Stability or improvement in the clinical symptoms and signs of NPH as determined by the trialists and continuing for at least one year. Outcome measures are to include: <BR/>(i) the presence or absence of incontinence; <BR/>(ii) improvement in scores obtained on validated neuropsychological tests (such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)); <BR/>(iii) increase in speed of walking (measured in metres per second); <BR/>(iv) Clinician's Global Impression of Change. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-09 12:21:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>As yet, there is no published trial of shunting versus no shunt. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Boon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boon 1998</LINK> is reported and quotes data from the same participants in two other papers (<LINK REF="STD-Boon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Boon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tans-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tans 1999</LINK>); it was a randomized controlled trial comparing the pressure sensitivity of two types of shunting device. <LINK REF="STD-Tans-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tans 1999</LINK> mentioned that those individuals with evidence of co-existent cerebrovascular disease who were shunted had poorer functional outcomes than those who had no evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Further comparison of shunt type is contained in the article by <LINK REF="STD-Pollack-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pollack 1999</LINK> and in a letter reply from <LINK REF="STD-Czosnyka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Czosnyka 2000</LINK>, and in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Keifer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Keifer 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2006-b" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2006 b</LINK>. The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2006-a" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2006 a</LINK> looked at the effects of different opening pressure settings in the valves used in implanted shunts in patients with NPH, but there was no control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Black-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1980</LINK> presented a retrospective review of the outcome of placement of a CSF shunt in 62 patients who underwent the operation. Improvement in functional grading was seen in 33%, but there was no control group.</P>
<P>The only randomized trial of shunt placement versus a control group without shunt has been presented as phase I of an ongoing clinical trial exploring the effects of this treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 2000</LINK>). A larger confirmatory study is planned.</P>
<P>An attempt to predict likely responders to shunt placement in NPH was published by <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1994</LINK>. There was no randomization and no control group. The aetiology of the NPH syndrome in the 15 participants was given as stroke in three, trauma in five, and unknown in the others. Eight patients out of 15 who had shunts 'responded' although the level of response was not indicated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK> presented results of shunting in NPH in patients where the decision for shunting had been made on the basis of initial response of gait to temporary CSF drainage.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2007</LINK> carried out neuropsychological testing in patients with NPH before and after temporary CSF drainage, and showed that those who had no improvement in tasks of verbal memory were less likely to show a response to shunting.</P>

<P>The efficacy of shunting in the treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus has not yet been evaluated in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The exact definition of the syndrome varies between researchers. From the above trials, it can be seen that inclusion of individuals with enlarged cerebral ventricles involves many diverse causes. This makes evaluation of trials difficult. Co-existent diseases, such as cerebrovascular disease, which could cause a clinical syndrome of dementia indistinguishable from that of the classical NPH syndrome was permitted in some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duplessis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Duplessis 1991</LINK>). The trials published so far have simply compared the functional outcome of different shunts or the prediction of outcome by pre-operative test lumbar drainage. No trial has yet compared the placement of a shunt versus no shunt in a randomized controlled manner. Nor have the long-term outcomes of treated and untreated NPH been compared. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2006-c" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2006 c</LINK> looked at the clinical outcome in 51 patients with NPH treated by shunt insertion after an average of 34 months follow-up: an excellent, good or satisfactory outcome was recorded in 67% of patients, however, this was not a randomized trial of treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials that shunting is effective or ineffective in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is need for a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of shunting in the treatment of NPH.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2008-04-04 11:30:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>According to the CSF hydrodynamic mechanism that I suggest on www.med-lavrencic.si/raziskava.htm, there could be severe complications in using a shunt from CSF space to extracraniovertebral location for a patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Namely, there is most probably a last barrier starting at around 30 mmHg of ICP that prevents further progressive volume expansion of brain or its blood volume in the pathophysiological phase of intracraniovertebral volume homeostasis. At this ICP, the CSF formation and CSF removal stops while CSF stasis physically prevents any further decrease of CSF volume and further intracranial volume imbalance. By applying a shunt that enables CSF drainage beyond 30 mm Hg of ICP, there is no ultimate barrier and extreme intracranial volume imbalance (at very high ICP) could cause severe consequences (for example, when a patient with shunt experiences traumatic brain injury or stroke that causes higher ICP than 30 mm Hg). This complication differs from shunt overdrainage syndrome with decreased ICP (a slit ventricles syndrome or a very low ICP syndrome). Comment from Darko Lavrencic (28 September 2002).</P>

<P>The authors reply that the high pressures in the CSF that you are concerned with do not occur in NPH and are, therefore, not dealt with in the review. Reply added 24 April 2003.</P>
