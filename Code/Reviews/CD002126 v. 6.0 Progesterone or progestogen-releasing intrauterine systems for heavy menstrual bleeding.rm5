<TITLE>Use of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for heavy menstrual bleeding</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-09 10:47:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>This Cochrane review has evaluated whether the levonorgestrel&#8211;releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and whether it is safe and acceptable.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Heavy or excessive menstrual bleeding is a common problem in women before they reach the menopause. Women who feel that their menstrual bleeding is excessive will have reduced quality of life and are likely to seek medical help. A wide variety of treatments, of variable effectiveness, are available for women with heavy bleeding. These include oral tablets, such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-fibrinolytic drugs, the contraceptive pill and drugs containing progestogen. Surgery, either hysterectomy (removal of the womb) or endometrial ablation (removal of the inner lining of the womb) are also commonly used, often when drug treatments are ineffective. A less invasive alternative to these options is the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system, a device placed inside the womb, which regularly delivers small amounts of progestogen and can also be used for contraception.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>This review contains 21 RCTs conducted up to July 2014 that included 2082 participants with heavy menstrual bleeding. Evidence obtained is current to January 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>Almost all the studies assessed the effects of the LNG IUS and conclusions refer only to this device. The LNG IUS was more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding and improving quality of life than oral medication. Satisfaction with treatment was not assessed in enough trials to know whether this was better with LNG IUS. The evidence suggested that the LNG IUS and techniques used to remove the inner lining of the womb were similarly effective at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding and improving quality of life and satisfaction and the two treatments had similar failure rates. The LNG IUS caused higher rates of some side effects, such as breast tenderness, bloating, weight gain and ovarian cysts, but this did not seem to cause women to stop taking their treatment. The LNG IUS was not as effective as hysterectomy in reducing menstrual blood loss but improvements in quality of life were similar. Although many women trying the LNG IUS eventually went on to have a hysterectomy for their heavy menstrual bleeding, the LNG IUS appeared to have lower overall costs than either endometrial ablation or hysterectomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>Many of the trials in this review were small (&lt;100 participants) and some were at high risk of bias. Ratings for the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison ranged from very low to high. Limitations in the evidence included inadequate reporting of study methods and inconsistency. One large trial compared the LNG IUS with hysterectomy over a 10-year period and a number of other trials made assessments two years after starting treatment, so we have some information on the long-term effects of treatments. Future research needs to measure satisfaction.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:45:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women and it accounts for 12% of all gynaecology referrals in the UK. Heavy menstrual bleeding is clinically defined as greater than or equal to 80 mL of blood loss per menstrual cycle. However, women may complain of excessive bleeding when their blood loss is less than 80 mL. Hysterectomy is often used to treat women with this complaint but medical therapy may be a successful alternative.</P>
<P>The intrauterine device was originally developed as a contraceptive but the addition of progestogens to these devices resulted in a large reduction in menstrual blood loss. Case studies of two types of progesterone or progestogen-releasing systems, Progestasert and Mirena, reported reductions of up to 90% and improvements in dysmenorrhoea (pain or cramps during menstruation). Insertion, however, may be regarded as invasive by some women, which affects its acceptability as a treatment. Frequent intermenstrual bleeding and spotting is also likely during the first few months after commencing treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-19 13:24:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>To determine the effectiveness, acceptability and safety of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in achieving a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-09 10:47:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>All randomised controlled trials of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained by electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Library,</I> the specialised register of MDSG, MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January 2015), CINAHL (inception to December 2014) and PsycINFO (inception to January 2015). Additional searches were undertaken for grey literature and for unpublished trials in trial registers. Companies producing progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices and experts in the field were contacted for information on published and unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials in women of reproductive age treated with progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices versus no treatment, placebo, or other medical or surgical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding within primary care, family planning or specialist clinic settings were eligible for inclusion. Women with postmenopausal bleeding, intermenstrual or irregular bleeding, or pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:45:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Potential trials were independently assessed by at least two review authors. The review authors extracted the data independently and data were pooled where appropriate. Risk ratios (RRs) were estimated from the data for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes were reduction in menstrual blood loss and satisfaction; in addition, rate of adverse effects, changes in quality of life, failure of treatment and withdrawal from treatment were also assessed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-28 17:21:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We included 21 RCTs (2082 women). The included trials mostly assessed the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) (no conclusions could be reached from one small study assessing Progestasert which was discontinued in 2001) and so conclusions are based only on LNG IUS. Comparisons were made with placebo, oral medical treatment, endometrial destruction techniques and hysterectomy. Ratings for the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison ranged from very low to high. Limitations in the evidence included inadequate reporting of study methods and inconsistency.</P>
<P>Seven studies compared the LNG IUS with oral medical therapy: either norethisterone acetate (NET) administered over most of the menstrual cycle, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (administered for 10 days), the oral contraceptive pill, mefenamic acid or usual medical treatment where participants could choose the oral treatment that was most suitable. The LNG IUS was more effective at reducing HMB as measured by the alkaline haematin method (MD 66.91 mL, 95% CI 42.61 to 91.20; two studies, 170 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 81%, <I>low quality evidence</I>) or by Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC) scores (MD 55.05, 95% CI 27.83 to 82.28; three studies, 335 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 79%, <I>low quality evidence</I>), improving quality of life and a greater number of women continued with their treatment at two years when compared with oral treatment. Although substantial heterogeneity was identified for the bleeding outcomes, the direction of effect consistently favoured the LNG IUS. There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions on satisfaction. Minor adverse effects (such as pelvic pain, breast tenderness and ovarian cysts) were more common with the LNG IUS.</P>
<P>Ten studies compared the LNG IUS with endometrial destruction techniques: three with transcervical resection, one with rollerball ablation and six with thermal balloon ablation. Evidence was inconsistent and very low quality with respect to reduction in bleeding outcomes and satisfaction was comparable between treatments (low and moderate quality evidence). Improvements in quality of life were experienced with both types of treatment. Minor adverse events were more common with the LNG IUS overall, but it appeared more cost effective compared to thermal ablation within a two-year time frame in one study.</P>
<P>Three studies compared the LNG IUS with hysterectomy. The LNG IUS was not as successful at reducing HMB as hysterectomy (<I>high quality evidence</I>). The women in these studies reported improved quality of life, regardless of treatment. In spite of the high rate of surgical treatment in those having LNG IUS within 10 years, the LNG IUS was more cost effective than hysterectomy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 14:01:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) is more effective than oral medication as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). It is associated with a greater reduction in HMB, improved quality of life and appears to be more acceptable long term but is associated with more minor adverse effects than oral therapy.<BR/>When compared to endometrial ablation, it is not clear whether the LNG IUS offers any benefits with regard to reduced HMB and satisfaction rates and quality of life measures were similar. Some minor adverse effects were more common with the LNG IUS but it appeared to be more cost effective than endometrial ablation techniques.</P>
<P>The LNG IUS was less effective than hysterectomy in reducing HMB. Both treatments improved quality of life but the LNG IUS appeared more cost effective than hysterectomy for up to 10 years after treatment.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-07 05:37:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common problem in women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Shapley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapley 2004</LINK>) and has a measurable effect on their quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). It can also lead to iron deficiency anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>), which can be life threatening in the most severe cases (<LINK REF="REF-Moragianni-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moragianni 2007</LINK>). The prevalence of HMB typically ranges from 9% to 14% in studies that assessed menstrual loss objectively or from 20% to 52% in studies based on subjective assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>HMB, also known as menorrhagia, is clinically defined as menstrual blood loss greater than or equal to 80 mL blood loss per menstrual cycle which can be objectively measured by the alkaline haematin test (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>) but this measurement of menstrual loss is impractical in routine practice. Another, more indirect, method of measuring menstrual loss is the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) which was first reported in 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>). This method is highly variable with sensitivity ranging from 58% to 97% and specificity ranging from 52% to 89% (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>); it is undertaken by the patient herself and has been more commonly used in research in the last decade than the objective alkaline haematin method. However, in practice, the woman's perception of her own menstrual loss is considered the key determinant in her referral and indeed subsequent treatment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:47:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The primary objective of treating HMB is to reduce the amount of menstrual blood loss and to improve quality of life. Hysterectomy has traditionally been considered the definitive treatment for HMB and it has been one of the most commonly performed operations in women, with HMB being a leading indication (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>). Although hysterectomy is invariably 100% successful in treating HMB and is associated with high success rates, it is major surgery with a relatively high incidence of short-term complications such as bleeding, infection and wound healing problems, together with a lengthy postoperative recovery period. There have been recent indications that the use of hysterectomy for HMB is declining from previous levels; in an analysis of inpatient hysterectomy rates in the United States between 1998 and 2010, hysterectomy for HMB increased to 274,473 in 2002 and then decreased to 195,231 in 2010 (a decline of 28.9%) (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2013</LINK>). Given that HMB is a benign condition, many women prefer a less invasive surgical option that conserves the womb (uterus). Endometrial resection and ablation procedures involve the destruction of the endometrium (inner lining of the womb) and the underlying basal glands by various means. These methods are safer than hysterectomy but also can cause complications and there is a high rate of further surgical treatment long term (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2013</LINK>). Thus, alternative medical therapy with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery is an attractive alternative. A wide variety of medications are available to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding but there is considerable variation in practice and uncertainty about the most appropriate therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1996</LINK>). Many of these treatments, both hormonal and non hormonal, are first line options, with surgery only being used when medical therapy is ineffective or unsuccessful.</P>
<P>The intrauterine device has primarily been used as a method of contraception. Progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems were initially introduced in an effort to reduce intrauterine device expulsion. It became apparent that prolonged use of these systems, when used for contraception, was associated with a profound reduction in menstrual blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berqvist-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berqvist 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Progestasert was the first hormonally impregnated device releasing 65 µg of progesterone per day; it required re-insertion approximately yearly but was discontinued in 2001. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) (Mirena, Bayer Healthcare) has been available to manage heavy menstrual bleeding in the United States since 2009 and even earlier than this in Europe. It is available in more than 100 countries worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Inki-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inki 2007</LINK>) and has been used by more than 9 million women (<LINK REF="REF-Mansour-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 2007</LINK>). It is a T-shaped device which releases LNG (a potent 19 testosterone-derived progestin) directly into the uterine cavity at a rate of 20 µg/day over a five-year time period and is associated with a profound reduction in menstrual blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2010</LINK>). However, insertion is an invasive procedure which may not be acceptable to some women. The device is broader than copper-bearing systems and insertion may require local anaesthesia and dilation of the cervical canal in nulliparous or peri-menopausal women. A disadvantage of the device is frequent and variable intermenstrual bleeding and spotting during the first few months of use (<LINK REF="REF-Suvisaari-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suvisaari 1996</LINK>). It is also an expensive intervention should its use be discontinued earlier than the five-year lifespan for which it is licensed as an effective contraceptive. Discontinuation may be because of pelvic discomfort or dissatisfaction with the side effects.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:47:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Local hormone delivery results in high levonorgestrel levels in the endometrial tissue but systemic circulation levels are low. These effects can appear as early as one month after insertion making it an effective method of non surgical management of HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>). Locally released hormone leads to endometrial thinning, glandular atrophy (decreased size of glands), and inflammation. It leads to a reduction in HMB of more than 80% over three to six months treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2005b</LINK>) and perceived subjective reduction in HMB is similar to that achieved after endometrial ablative treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The LNG IUS has been compared favourably to other medical treatments for heavy cyclical blood loss (<LINK REF="STD-Milsom-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 1991</LINK>). It improves dysmenorrhoea and may reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, particularly in those under the age of 25 years, by thickening the utero-cervical mucus. Twenty per cent of the women using the LNG IUS were amenorrhoeic after one year's use whilst still continuing to ovulate (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1994</LINK>). It also appears to have reduced the number of women undergoing hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2005b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:47:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>HMB or menorrhagia is a common gynaecological condition and has an enormous effect on quality of life of affected women, and on the healthcare system. In the United States, the direct and indirect cost of management of HMB is approximately USD 1 billion and USD 12 billion, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). Medical management with oral agents includes a variety of hormonal and non hormonal therapies with variable effectiveness and tolerability. This has led women to seek surgical procedures such as endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. Given the risk of complications with all surgery and the high probability of further surgery in women undergoing endometrial destruction, it is important to seek an alternative effective, acceptable and safe treatment for HMB. Since the previous publication of this review in 2005, a number of studies have been conducted to compare the progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine system with other treatment modalities. Therefore, it was important to review these new studies with the aim of improving clinical practice.</P>

<P>For the 2015 update of the review, two review authors (AL and JR) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Studies were assessed for allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and personnel and separately of assessors), completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other bias (such as comparability of groups at baseline or other potential source of bias). Each domain was graded as either low risk of bias, unclear or high risk of bias. Source of funding for each study was also noted in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, although this is not a part of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached.</P>
<P>For previous versions of the review, at least two review authors (AL and IC) independently assessed the included studies for method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, methods of dealing with incomplete data and presence of intention-to-treat analysis and power calculations, and source of funding.</P>
<P>'Risk of bias' assessments are included for each study in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and for each outcome the overall risk of bias (for each study) for all studies included in the comparison contribute to the overall quality of evidence for the outcome (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g., treatment failure or amenorrhoea rates), we used the number of events in the two groups to calculate Mantel Haenszel risk ratios (RRs), together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where there was a statistical difference between the two groups, we calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTB and numbers needed to treat to harm (NNTH) (estimates of the number of women we would need to receive treatment in order for one woman to receive the benefit or harm).</P>
<P>For continuous data (e.g., PBAC bleeding score), we calculated mean differences (MD), with 95% CIs, between treatment groups. Ordinal data (e.g., quality of life scores) were treated as continuous data. Continuous data were only included in the meta-analysis if the underlying distribution of the measurement appeared normal. Data were roughly checked for skewness by calculating the ratio of the mean to its standard deviation; where this value was less than 1, the data were reported in tables as descriptive data. Tables were also used when authors reported their results as a median plus range or when trial results were incomplete (e.g., measures of variance could not be extracted).</P>
<P>In some trials, change scores (from baseline) were reported in preference to, or as well as, final values after treatment. These data were also included in the meta-analysis. Where data were not reported in numbers in the text of the publications, data were estimated from figures or graphs.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We planned to include only first phase data from cross-over trials, but no cross-over trials were included in the review.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, where possible, and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the authors of the included studies, where necessary. Where these were unobtainable and imputation or calculation were not feasible, only the available data were analysed.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a meaningful summary. Where studies were pooled in meta-analysis, heterogeneity (variation) between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points and their overlap and, more formally, by checking the results of the I<SUP>2</SUP> value (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This quantity describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Interpretation of a given degree of heterogeneity will differ according to whether the estimates show the same direction of effect.</P>
<P>A rough guide to interpretation of the I<SUP>2</SUP> value is as follows (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>0% to 40% might not be important;</LI>
<LI>30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Where considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 90%) was identified from the analyses, the data were not pooled but the individual summary effect estimates were displayed in forest plots without totals.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of trials. As there were fewer than 10 studies contributing to each outcome, the use of a funnel plot to further explore the potential for reporting bias and small-study effects was not possible.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:51:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>If the included studies were sufficiently similar, we pooled their results in meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We presented results in the review using a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity; otherwise a random-effects model was presented. The following comparisons were made:</P>
<UL>
<LI>IUS versus placebo;</LI>
<LI>IUS versus any other medical treatment;</LI>
<LI>IUS versus endometrial ablation;</LI>
<LI>IUS versus hysterectomy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These comparisons were stratified by follow-up interval, where necessary; outcomes were assessed up to 12 months after initiation of treatment or greater than 12 months for outcomes such as satisfaction and treatment failure. Otherwise, data were reported at the end of study.</P>
<P>An increase in the risk of the IUS intervention of a particular outcome which may be beneficial (e.g., satisfaction with treatment) is displayed graphically in the forest plots to the right of the centre line; otherwise, a decrease in the risk (e.g., adverse events) is displayed in the forest plots to the left of the centre line.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:52:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Where data were available, we conducted subgroup analysis to determine the separate evidence for the following outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>individual adverse events (e.g., nausea, vaginitis);</LI>
<LI>method of assessing menstrual blood loss (alkaline haematin or PBAC scores);</LI>
<LI>quality of life domain scores (e.g., physical functioning, general health);</LI>
<LI>menstrual bleeding assessments (amenorrhoea, hypomenorrhoea, eumenorrhoea or improvement in bleeding).</LI>
</UL>
<P>When we detected substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%), we explored possible explanations by checking the data, examining clinical and methodological differences between the studies and conducting post hoc sensitivity analyses. We considered any substantial heterogeneity that was identified, especially when there was a variation in the direction of the effect, in our interpretation of the results.</P>

This table evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (improvement in HMB and satisfaction) and also for failure of treatment, using GRADE criteria (study limitations (i.e. risk of bias), consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias). Judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate or low) have been justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome.</P>

<P>Prior to the 2015 update, 10 randomised controlled trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review. From the 27 potentially relevant studies identified in the 2015 update, 12 met the criteria for inclusion, and four further studies were additional publications (with longer follow-up) for studies already included with the review. Two other studies are ongoing and have not yet reported results (<LINK REF="STD-Herman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHiPP-2013" TYPE="STUDY">SHiPP 2013</LINK>) and three studies are waiting assessment. One study that had been included prior to the 2015 update <LINK REF="STD-Lahteenmaki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lahteenmaki 1998</LINK>) was excluded because it was no longer considered relevant; the list of outcomes in the review were reduced and this study no longer measured any relevant outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants were mostly recruited either from gynaecology clinics or referred by general practitioners but some women referred themselves by responding to advertisements. In a few trials, women had been scheduled for hysterectomy and in seven trials, women had failed first line medical therapy. A majority of trials excluded women with fibroids of any kind or either those greater than a certain diameter or those large enough to distort the uterine cavity. One research group investigated the effects of treatments separately in women with fibroids (but excluding submucous fibroids of any size distorting the uterine cavity or intramural or subserous fibroids greater than 5 cm in diameter) and women without any evidence of fibroids (in two separate publications). Many studies required women to have completed their families. Menstrual blood loss was usually confirmed by the alkaline haematin method or Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC) scores prior to the initiation of treatment in consecutive menstrual cycles but in two trials, women were eligible if they considered their menstrual blood flow excessive. In one trial, participants complaining of HMB were only included if they had confirmed adenomyosis, but in two other trials adenomyosis was an exclusion criteria. One trial investigated the effects of treatments for HMB in women taking anticoagulant medication after cardiac valve replacement.</P>

<P>All of the trials except one used the LNG IUS (Mirena) that releases 20 µg/day of levonorgestrel.

This small trial did not evaluate group differences statistically and although randomised, groups were not comparable at baseline.

In trials where the LNG IUS was compared with surgery (balloon, rollerball or transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE)), treatment failure was defined as an increase of HMB or no improvement in haemoglobin levels, major change in treatment (either expulsion or removal of LNG IUS or initiation of alternative treatment (either medical or surgical)) or PBAC score &gt;/= 75 and re-surgery in the surgical group or removal of LNG IUS.</P>

Other quality of life instruments in the included studies that measured specific aspects of quality of life, such as sexual functioning and anxiety were not eligible for the review.</P>
<P>Adverse events were measured in 11 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kittelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kittelsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Malak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozdegirmenci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdegirmenci 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soysal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soysal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TALIS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TALIS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tam-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tam 2006</LINK>). These were mostly measured incidentally and were secondary outcomes in the trials. A few trials also measured discontinuation from the study because of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kittelsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kittelsen 1998</LINK>). Some adverse events were not directly compared because they were associated specifically with the mode of treatment, for example, bowel perforation in hysterectomy or expulsion rate of the LNG IUS.</P>
<P>Costs were compared between groups in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TALIS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TALIS 2006</LINK>); one comparing costs of LNG IUS with hysterectomy and the other with thermal balloon ablation.</P>
<P>Duration of follow-up varied between the included studies. The single placebo controlled study had minimal follow-up of three months.Trials comparing the LNG IUS with various types of medical treatment ranged from two months to two years follow-up. This latter trial, ELIPSE, is planning to monitor participants for five and 10 years. Over half of the trials comparing the LNG IUS with endometrial ablation had 12 months follow-up, one had six months follow-up and the remaining three trials had two, three and five years follow-up. Two of the trials comparing hysterectomy with the LNG IUS had 12-month follow-up; in the remaining trial, conducted in Finland, participants were monitored for 10 years. Outcomes from trials with minimal follow-up should be considered with caution. From the case series studies, it is known that menstrual irregularity may be problematic in the first months after insertion of the LNG IUS (<LINK REF="REF-Suvisaari-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suvisaari 1996</LINK>); thus, assessment of this method after two or three months may give a misleadingly poor outcome.</P>
<P>Some of the outcomes from the studies could be pooled in the meta-analysis. Other outcomes could not be pooled because the data were heavily skewed or measures of variation were not reported and individual participant data were not available for transformation.</P>

<P>All trials were considered at high risk of bias for blinding; mostly it was not feasible to blind participants to the differing nature of the interventions. As a majority of the primary outcomes were self-reported by the participants, this means that assessments also were generally unblinded. These studies were considered at high risk of bias for these domains because knowledge of treatment could have influenced the responses made. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2012</LINK>) attempted to blind participants until randomised allocation was completed. Surgeons and assessors were blinded to allocation but the participants scored the PBAC instrument, quality of life and postoperative pain and the knowledge of treatment may have influenced their responses.</P>

<P>Compared with medical treatment, the progestogen-releasing IUS was associated with significantly reduced menstrual bleeding in most trials measuring this outcome.</P>
<P>Where summary effect measures could be calculated, treatment with the LNG IUS was associated with a significantly greater percentage reduction from baseline by the alkaline haematin method when compared to the oral contraceptive pill (MD 66.91 mL, 95% CI 42.61 to 91.20; two studies, 170 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 81%), or by PBAC scores (MD 55.05, 95% CI 27.83 to 82.28; three studies, 335 women; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 79%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Two of the trials in this pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sayed-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sayed 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shabaan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shabaan 2011</LINK>) also reported significantly reduced menstrual blood loss at the end of study with LNG IUS compared to the combined oral contraceptive, although substantial heterogeneity meant they couldn't be pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four other studies where the data could not be pooled confirmed the significant benefits found with the IUS (four studies with alkaline haematin measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irvine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Irvine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaunitz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kaunitz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>) and one with PBAC score measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Reid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2005</LINK>)); one study found that menstrual fluid loss was significantly reduced with LNG IUS and one other study found a non significant trend towards higher rates of amenorrhoea with LNG IUS. These analyses considered any comparison of the LNG IUS with either medical therapy as a whole, given that women often are given choices of the most appropriate medical treatment, according to their personal circumstances/preference, mefenamic acid or oral progestogens. With regard to data on the delivery method of progestogens (intrauterine device versus oral treatment), two trials compared the LNG IUS with either a long course oral progestogens, norethisterone acetate (NET) or 10-day MPA; in the LNG IUS versus NET comparison, there was no evidence of a significant difference in reduction of HMB but LNG IUS was more successful at reducing HMB than MPA (administered for 10 days).

A large good-quality pragmatic trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2013</LINK>) that compared the LNG IUS with medical treatment (patients randomised to medical treatment received the treatment that was most appropriate to their needs) reported significant improvements in quality of life for a number of domains at two years follow-up (MMAS summary score, SF36 individual scores and EQ5-D), except for mental health (SF36) and EQ5D descriptive scale (<LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>One large study reported no statistical difference in the rate of serious side effects between groups and there was no statistical difference in the prevalence of most individual side effects. However, the LNG was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of pelvic pain (RR 2.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 7.18; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; three studies, 784 women), breast tenderness (RR 2.85, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.29; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; three studies, 244 women) and ovarian cysts (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.21; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; three studies, 784 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>).

<P>One large study reported on the proportions of women who were still on treatment at two-year follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2013</LINK>). The reasons for discontinuation included adverse effects, lack of efficacy, personal reasons, lack of tolerability and menopause. Women with the LNG IUS were significantly less likely to withdraw from treatment within the two years than those allocated to medical treatment (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.70; NNTB = 4, one study, 571 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exploration of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Substantial heterogeneity was identified when studies were pooled for assessment of reduction in HMB. Two trials at high overall risk of bias measured menstrual blood loss at the end of the study in two different groups of participants: those with no fibroids and those with fibroid-related HMB by two different methods, alkalin haematin and PBAC scores. Although the summary estimates varied for HMB outcomes, the direction of effect always favoured the LNG IUS. The comparator was mostly the oral contraceptive pill but one study also compared the LNG IUS with MPA, an oral progestogen. The benefits found with LNG IUS in the forest plots were confirmed by studies at low risk of bias, which were not able to be pooled. There were generally too few studies to perform many sensitivity analyses. Adverse events were mainly recorded by studies at low risk of bias. For one outcome, withdrawal from treatment because of adverse events, the removal of a study at unclear overall risk of bias did not affect the findings. Thus, sensitivity analyses suggested that the findings were not influenced by trial quality, or women's fibroid status. We planned a sensitivity analysis restricting inclusion to LNG IUS studies only, but since only studies of LNG IUS were considered in this update, the planned sensitivity analyses were not performed.</P>

When menstrual bleeding was categorised in terms of its flow (amenorrhoea, hypomenorrhoea etc), there was no evidence of a difference in amenorrhoea or hypomenorrhoea rates after treatment between groups, but eumenorrhoea rates were significantly higher in women undergoing ablation (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.00; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 61%; three studies, 160 women) and improvement in bleeding pattern was significantly more likely in women with the LNG IUS (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.41; I<SUP>2</SUP>=40%; three studies, 172 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).

There was no evidence of a significant difference in most of the quality of life domains, with the exception of significantly improved general health (MD -14.40, 95% CI -22.63 to -6.17; one trial 33 women), social functioning (MD -6.70, 95% CI 12.82 to -0.58; one trial, 33 women), emotional role limitation (MD -10.10, 95% CI -17.03 to -3.17, one trial, 33 women) and mental health (MD -11.20, 95% CI -17.08 to -5.32, one trial, 33 women) in participants having endometrial ablation when compared to LNG IUS in one trial measuring the SF36. In three other trials also measuring SF36, no significant differences in domains between groups was identified, except for role limitations due to physical functioning; this was significantly improved in the ablation when compared to the LNG IUS group in one trial. Another trial assessed outcomes at five years (<LINK REF="STD-de-Souza-2010" TYPE="STUDY">de Souza 2010</LINK>). It found that physical and emotional wellbeing, assessed by participants as responses to a questionnaire, were significantly improved in those having LNG IUS compared to endometrial ablation but no differences were found in psychological wellbeing, as assessed by the Psychological General Wellbeing Index.</P>

<P>One trial published in 2006 found that the expected cost of treatment with LNG IUS was NZD 1241 compared to NZD 2418 for balloon ablation.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exploration of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>There were insufficient studies contributing to each outcome to undertake many sensitivity analyses. Where these could be performed, some differences were noted. In the forest plot measuring PBAC score at 12 months, substantial heterogeneity was demonstrated in the two studies measuring this outcome, one at low risk and the other at unclear risk of bias. When the study at unclear risk of bias was excluded, the PBAC score was significantly improved in women undergoing ablation when compared with LNG IUS. This finding was supported by the findings from the other study at low risk of bias which could not be pooled. The reported findings were not influenced by the type of endometrial ablation that was undertaken, or by whether the women had fibroids. Substantial heterogeneity was also identified in satisfaction rates in the subgroup, from one to five years follow-up. Both studies were at high overall risk of bias and the comparator was thermal balloon ablation. However, one of these studies measured satisfaction five years after treatment was initiated, while the other used different questioning after two years follow-up. Differences in the timing of the outcome and the questions asked may explain the discrepant findings between the two trials. As the included studies only assessed the LNG IUS, it was not possible to undertake the planned sensitivity analysis restricting to only studies of LNG IUS.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:57:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review has assessed the effectiveness and safety of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) in 20 studies with 2052 participants (an additional small trial of the first hormonally impregnated device, Progestasert (now discontinued) was at high risk of bias and did not present between-group differences). The LNG IUS was compared with placebo in one trial, with medical treatments in seven trials, with endometrial ablation in 10 trials and with hysterectomy in three trials.</P>
<P>The LNG IUS was compared with placebo in women having cardiac valve replacement and their heavy menstrual bleeding was considered a potential side effect of their use of anticoagulant medications. Although the LNG IUS was associated with a reduced menstrual blood loss after six months of approximately 100 Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC) points, the mean score (155.6) after treatment was still considered within the range of heavy menstruation. Quality of life and satisfaction were not measured, so it is not possible to determine whether women found the treatment beneficial.</P>
<P>There was low level but consistent evidence that the LNG IUS improved bleeding outcomes and was less likely to fail when compared with a range of medical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), although there was insufficient evidence to determine whether this influenced satisfaction. Two studies by the same authors confirmed that the benefits in reduction of HMB with the LNG IUS were found in both fibroid-related and idiopathic HMB when compared with the oral contraceptive pill but both of these studies were at high overall risk of bias. It is important to note that participants with fibroid-related menorrhagia were excluded if they had submucous fibroids of any size distorting the uterine cavity or intramural or subserous fibroids greater than 5 cm in diameter. The improvement in quality of life was significantly greater with LNG IUS compared to either usual medical treatment or the oral contraceptive pill, except for measures of mental health. Women were also more likely to be continuing with their LNG IUS treatment at two-year follow-up than those undergoing usual medical treatment. Some side effects (pelvic pain, breast tenderness and ovarian cysts) were more common with the LNG IUS.</P>
<P>When the LNG IUS was compared with endometrial ablative methods, evidence was mixed and inconsistent and mostly of low or very low overall quality. There was no evidence of a significant difference in bleeding outcomes, satisfaction, quality of life or rate of failure between treatments. The LNG IUS was more likely to cause breast pain, weight gain, bloating and acne or greasy skin, all adverse progestogenic effects. One trial conducted in New Zealand suggested that the LNG IUS was more cost effective than thermal balloon ablation.</P>
<P>The evidence from trials comparing the LNG IUS with hysterectomy was either high or moderate overall quality for the primary outcomes. Women having a hysterectomy had significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in comparison to those using the LNG IUS, but hysterectomy was less cost effective when compared to those having the LNG IUS, in spite of the high rate of hysterectomy in the LNG IUS group at long-term follow-up (46% in 10 years in one trial); quality of life and satisfaction were increased regardless of randomised treatment. One of the three studies included women with adenomyosis; in this study, quality of life was improved with both hysterectomy and the LNG IUS. Adverse event profiles differed: hysterectomy was associated with more wound infection and back pain and the LNG IUS increased the incidence of ovarian cysts.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:57:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The review included 21 studies that compared the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system with placebo, medical treatment, endometrial ablation or hysterectomy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Some of the women in the trials had fibroid-related bleeding (excluding large intramural/subserous fibroids and submucous fibroids causing distortion) and in others the heavy bleeding was associated with conditions such as adenomyosis or anticoagulant therapy. The effectiveness of the LNG IUS on bleeding outcomes was assessed in various ways: objectively by the alkaline haematin method, semi-objectively by scores on the PBAC or according to definitions of menorrhagia or hypomenorrhoea. The findings with respect to HMB seemed consistent regardless of the method of measurement.</P>
<P>Reduction of HMB should correlate with improving quality of life. In the United Kingdom, NICE has provided a working definition of HMB based on quality of life, rather than measured blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). It defines HMB as "excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with a woman's physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms" and emphasises that treatment should aim at improving quality of life measurements. Treatment with the LNG IUS generally improved health-related quality of life measurements, irrespective of the quality of life instrument used and this treatment improved quality of life when compared to medical treatment, and was at least as satisfactory as surgery, either endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. Few studies measured satisfaction and generally this did not differ between treatments.</P>
<P>LNG IUS was associated with a number of progestagen-related adverse events in the included studies but there was no evidence that these effects resulted in increased withdrawal from treatment. Incidence of ovarian cysts was increased but these were generally symptomless and had a high rate of resolution (<LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only two studies measured comparative costs; one compared the LNG IUS with thermal balloon ablation (<LINK REF="STD-TALIS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">TALIS 2006</LINK>) and the other compared the LNG IUS with hysterectomy for up to 10 years follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Hurskainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurskainen 2001</LINK>). The LNG IUS was generally more cost effective when compared to surgery. In the latter trial, at 10 years follow-up, 46% of the women allocated to the LNG IUS eventually underwent hysterectomy but the discounted direct and indirect costs remained substantially lower than in the hysterectomy group.</P>
<P>Many of the trials in this review were small (&lt;100 participants) and some were at high risk of bias which means findings are sometimes inconsistent. One large trial compared the LNG IUS with hysterectomy over a 10-year period and a number of other trials made assessments two years after starting treatment, so we have some information on the long-term effects of treatments. Future research needs to measure satisfaction.</P>

Limitations in the evidence included inadequate reporting of study methods and heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Overall, the risk of bias in the included trials varied. All of the trials were had unblinded participants, mostly because of the nature of the interventions. Although the primary bleeding outcome was sometimes measured objectively, in some trials, women were still required to estimate their bleeding by filling in a pictorial chart and it was not possible to exclude the likelihood that knowledge of their treatment influenced their responses. Over half of the included studies reported adequate allocation procedures and allocation concealment but less than half either had minimal missing data or used measures to prevent bias from attrition and lost to follow-up.

<P>Efforts were made to retrieve all eligible studies by implementing a comprehensive search strategy which included searches for grey literature, but it is not possible to exclude the likelihood that some unpublished studies were missed.

Procedures to reduce other potential bias in the review process, such as duplicate selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were followed.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:57:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Most studies comparing medical treatments for HMB have concluded that the LNG IUS is the most effective option, with the additional advantage that it offers contraception (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) and the progestogen component of menopausal hormone therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Somboonporn-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somboonporn 2011</LINK>). Reviews have generally concluded that the LNG IUS offers a considerable advantage to other medical treatments in reducing HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matteson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matteson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>), with median percentage reductions often exceeding 90%, certainly in the short term, but these reviews have not been able to determine whether the benefits persist long term and whether these translate into reduced adverse events. The long-term results of the ECLIPSE trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2013</LINK>), included in this review, may be able to provide answers. This large trial found that the LNG IUS improved quality of life when compared to usual medical treatment for up to two years and a large observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2014</LINK>), undertaken in several countries in the Asia Pacific region, also found that both satisfaction with treatment and quality of life measures were greater in women using the LNG IUS when compared to oral medical treatments (antifibrinolytics, oral progestins or the contraceptive pill), although both groups achieved benefits over time. Another review (<LINK REF="REF-You-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2006</LINK>) reported that LNG IUS was 20% less costly than oral medical treatment (mainly because of the high proportion of women in this latter group requiring additional surgical treatment) and also more effective.</P>
<P>With respect to minimal surgery, two systematic reviews have suggested that the LNG IUS appears to be at least as effective as endometrial ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2009</LINK>) (although Middleton acknowledges that evidence is limited), with similar failure rates and quality of life.</P>
<P>Agreement is more mixed with regards to comparisons with hysterectomy which generally focus on quality of life and costs; these studies are strongly influenced by the perspective of the health system in the country of origin. One cost effectiveness review with a UK perspective (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>) concluded that hysterectomy was the preferred strategy for the first treatment of HMB when three options were compared: hysterectomy, endometrial ablation and LNG IUS. Although hysterectomy was more expensive, it produced more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for hysterectomy when compared with LNG IUS being GBP 1440 per additional QALY. The results were highly sensitive to the utility values used in the analysis. Another review (<LINK REF="REF-You-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2006</LINK>), using a healthcare Hong Kong perspective, concluded that hysterectomy was the most effective option (comparison of hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, LNG IUS and medical therapy) with the highest cost. The incremental cost per additional QALY gained by hysterectomy was USD 23,500. The hysterectomy group gained a higher number of QALYs than LNG IUS, oral medical treatment and endometrial ablation groups 99%, 99% and 98% of the time and was more costly than the other three groups over 85% of the time. Another UK cost utility study (<LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2007</LINK>) compared the five-yearly cost of LNG IUS followed by hysterectomy, LNG IUS followed by endometrial ablation, immediate endometrial ablation by either thermal balloon or microwave and hysterectomy. LNG IUS followed by endometrial ablation dominated all the alternative treatments. By contrast, a review (<LINK REF="REF-Ganz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganz 2013</LINK>), using a US payer perspective, concluded that the LNG IUS resulted in the lowest treatment costs and the fewest number of hysterectomies performed over five years compared with all other initial strategies and resulted in the most QALYs gained among non surgical options. Initial treatment with LNG IUS was the least costly and most effective option for women desiring to preserve their fertility. The discrepancy between the findings of these reviews is likely to relate to differences in the methods used and the cost input. However, assuming a USD 50,000 per QALY, LNG IUS treatment was either the dominant or a cost effective strategy and its overall associated costs were lower than those of other treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:57:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline in heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women, including selected women with fibroids. It appears to be more effective than oral medical therapies and results in better quality of life outcomes. It is not clear whether this translates into improved satisfaction but women appear to be less likely to withdraw from treatment by two years. There is very limited and low-quality evidence that LNG IUS appeared to have similar effectiveness to endometrial ablation methods and quality of life outcomes were similar. LNG IUS is associated with adverse events such as breast or pelvic pain and bloating when compared with other treatments, which are not directly comparable to the adverse events encountered with surgery. Both the LNG IUS and hysterectomy improved health-related quality of life, which was most apparent within the five years after treatment. Although many women treated with LNG IUS eventually had hysterectomy (up to 46% within 10 years), the LNG IUS remained cost effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-07 04:57:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Further research is required to compare specific types of endometrial destruction techniques with the LNG IUS. Trials should plan for long-term follow-up (at least five years which is the licensed life span of LNG IUS for contraception) and should focus on measuring satisfaction, and acceptability of the treatment options and quality of life of women with HMB.</P>

<P>The 2015 update amended the list of included outcomes (from the protocol) as follows:</P>
<P>The following outcomes specified in the protocol were deleted: Duration of MBL in days, number of sanitary pads per cycle, acceptability of treatment and mortality. Duration of menstrual blood loss and number of sanitary pads per cycle were excluded as there is no evidence of a correlation between the extent of blood loss and these outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>). The outcome, acceptability of treatment, was considered to be too similar to satisfaction with treatment. Mortality was considered a rare event that was unlikely to be measured in studies.</P>
<P>One study that had been included prior to the 2015 update (<LINK REF="STD-Lahteenmaki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lahteenmaki 1998</LINK>) was excluded because it no longer measured any of the amended outcomes.</P>
