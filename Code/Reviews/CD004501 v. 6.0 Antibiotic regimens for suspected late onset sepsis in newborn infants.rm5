<P>Antibiotics for newborn infants that might have blood infections when more than 48 hours old. Blood infection (sepsis) can make newborn infants seriously ill or even kill them. Sepsis in newborns more than 48 hours old is called late onset neonatal sepsis; it is usually caused by bacteria, and sometimes by fungal infection. Doctors often give antibiotics if they suspect this dangerous condition as it can be difficult to tell if a newborn has late onset neonatal sepsis. Certain antibiotics given for this condition can have serious side effects, including antibiotic resistance, which can result in worse infection. This Cochrane review examined which antibiotics are best for treating late onset neonatal sepsis, in terms of effectiveness and side effects. The authors searched the medical literature and found only one study that met all the criteria the authors were looking for. This study, from 1988, enrolled 28 newborn infants. Some of the newborns received a beta lactam antibiotic by itself while others got the beta lactam plus another antibiotic, an aminoglycoside. There were no significant differences between the two kinds of antibiotic treatment in this study. The Cochrane review authors concluded that there is not enough research to recommend one kind of antibiotic treatment over another for late onset neonatal sepsis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Late onset neonatal sepsis (systemic infection after 48 hours of age) continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Early treatment with antibiotics is essential as infants can deteriorate rapidly. It is not clear which antibiotic regimen is most suitable for initial treatment of suspected late onset sepsis. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of different antibiotic regimens for treatment of suspected late onset sepsis in newborn infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 - Dec 2004), EMBASE (1980 - Dec 2004) and CINAHL (1982 - Dec 2004), electronic abstracts of Pediatric Academic Society meetings (1996 - Dec 2004) and previous reviews including cross references (all articles referenced).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials comparing different initial antibiotic regimens in neonates with suspected late onset sepsis were evaluated.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both reviewer authors screened abstracts and papers against the inclusion criteria, appraised the quality of and extracted data from papers. For dichotomous outcomes, treatment effect was expressed as relative risk and risk difference with 95% confidence intervals. NNT was calculated for outcomes for which there was a statistically significant reduction in risk difference. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen studies were identified as possibly eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies were excluded as they did not separate data for early and late onset infection. Two studies are still awaiting assessment. Only one small study, in 24 neonates, was included in this review. It compared beta-lactam therapy with a combination of beta lactam plus aminoglycoside. The study did not meet our prespecified criteria for good methodological quality. In babies with suspected infection there was no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.23) or treatment failure (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.23). Antibiotic resistance was assessed and there were no cases in either group. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is inadequate evidence from randomised trials in favour of any particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of suspected late onset neonatal sepsis. The available evidence is not of high quality. Although suspected sepsis and antibiotic use is common, quality research is required to specifically address both narrow and broad spectrum antibiotic use for late onset neonatal sepsis. Future research also needs to assess cost effectiveness and the impact of antibiotics in different settings such as developed or developing countries and lower gestational age groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 10:06:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although advances in neonatal intensive care have led to improved survival of very low birth weight (VLBW) and extremely premature infants, late onset sepsis (systemic infection after 48 hours of age) continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of late onset sepsis increases with both decreasing birthweight and gestational age, and has been reported as occurring in approximately 25% of VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1996</LINK>). Infants with the lowest birth weights are also more likely to have multiple episodes of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). In developing countries infection is estimated to cause 30 - 40% of neonatal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). The spectrum of organisms responsible for early onset (vertically transmitted) sepsis differs from that associated with late onset (nosocomial) sepsis. This pattern becomes apparent from day two onwards (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1996</LINK>). Nosocomial infections are frequently associated with clinical deterioration including increased apnoea or ventilatory requirement, temperature instability, abdominal distension, acidosis, lethargy, septic shock, necrotising enterocolitis, meningitis and death (<LINK REF="REF-Craft-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craft 1999</LINK>). The complications of necrotising enterocolitis and meningitis predispose an infant to an increased risk of future neurological impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waugh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waugh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>) and the mortality from late onset sepsis remains high, at 7 - 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1996</LINK>). These infections are often particularly distressing for infants, parents and staff as they affect VLBW infants who have survived early causes of mortality but remain at risk for ongoing infection. This risk is secondary to: immature immune responses, poorly developed skin and mucosal barriers to infection, numerous entry portals for organisms via cannulae, catheters and endotracheal tubes and continuing exposure to oppurtunistic organisms during often a prolonged hospital stay.</P>
<P>The range of organisms causing late onset sepsis includes gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as fungal infection. As bacterial infections predominate, empiric antibiotic regimens focus on cover for both gram positive and negative bacterial infection. These antibiotics can be either narrow or broad spectrum in the range of organisms that they target. The epidemiology of late onset infection differs between developing and developed countries in the incidence of infection, the organisms responsible, and the subsequent mortality rates. Historical reviews have also demonstrated that the predominant organisms responsible for neonatal sepsis have changed with time (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996 (a)</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developing countries, the most common gram positive organisms isolated from neonatal blood cultures taken from babies under 90 days of age are streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. The most frequent gram negative organisms isolated are E coli and salmonella spp (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). WHO recommend that initial treatment of suspected neonatal sepsis should be with penicillin and gentamicin. This regimen covers most of the likely organisms but has poor coverage of both salmonella and the increasingly penicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.</P>
<P>In developed countries staphylococcus aureus was previously responsible for the majority of late onset infections in many neonatal units with other commonly isolated organisms being coagulase negative staphylococci, E coli, group B streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus, candida and pseudomonas. Coagulase negative staphylococci(CoNS) have now emerged as the leading cause of late onset sepsis in almost all developed countries and account for &gt; 50% of positive blood cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1996</LINK>). As skin commensals, these organisms are also common blood culture contaminants, and there is a lack of consensus as to how to interpret CoNS positive results. In the intensive care setting the vast majority of CoNS are resistant to methicillin and thus infants with suspected late onset infection are typically treated with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics that include vancomycin (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2002</LINK>). There are concerns regarding unrestricted vancomycin use as a risk factor for the development of resistant organisms, particularly enterococci (<LINK REF="REF-HICPAC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">HICPAC 1995</LINK>). Its routine use as prophylaxis against nosocomial infection has not been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Craft-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craft 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, the majority of pathogens associated with fulminant late onset sepsis (lethal within 48 hours) have been shown to be gram negative organisms with pseudomonas leading the table (<LINK REF="REF-Karlowicz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlowicz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2004-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2004 (a)</LINK>). Therefore, although CoNS are currently the most prevalent pathogens in late onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units the associated mortality is low.</P>
<P>Empiric antibiotic treatment varies between neonatal intensive care units and countries and there are currently no consensus guidelines on the choice of empiric antibiotics. There are also no definitive guidelines on classification of CoNS as true sepsis or contaminant, the removal of indwelling catheters or the duration of antibiotics for late onset sepsis. The definition of late onset sepsis varies between trials and for the purpose of this review we will not include those infants commenced on antibiotics prior to 48 hours of age as the type of organisms and method of transmission of infection differ.<BR/>
</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens for initial treatment of suspected late onset sepsis (after 48 hours of age) in newborn infants with respect to mortality, septic shock and neurodevelopmental outcome. Separate comparisons of pre specified antibiotic regimens defined below were undertaken. Planned subgroup analyses include very low birth weight (less than approximately 1500 g) or very preterm infants (less than approximately 32 weeks gestation) and developing compared with developed countries.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 - Dec 2004), EMBASE (1980 - Dec 2004) and CINAHL (1982 - Dec 2004) and previous reviews including cross references (all articles referenced). The search strategy included the following keywords, using the search fields of abstract, MeSH subject heading, exploded subject heading, publication type, subject heading word, text word, and title: A search on all fields for [infan* OR newborn* OR neonat* ] AND "sepsis", "infection", "septicaemia", "late onset sepsis", "late onset infection" and "antibiotics" or "antimicrobials" was conducted. The search was limited to: [random* OR trial* OR comparative study OR controlled study]. We also searched electronic abstracts of Pediatric Academic Society meetings (1996 - Dec 2004) and personal files.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility of studies for inclusion was assessed independently by each review author. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. Quality of the trials included was evaluated in terms of allocation concealment, adequate randomisation, blinding of parents or carers and assessors to intervention, and completeness of assessment (intention to treat) in all randomised individuals (this was defined as yes, no or unsure for each category). A sensitivity analysis was planned according to the quality of the trials included. Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi square). Prespecified subgroup analysis was considered to further explore any heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Additional information was requested from the authors of both included and excluded eligible trials to clarify methodology and results as necessary. A data collection form was used to aid extraction of relevant information and data from each included study. Each review author extracted the data separately, compared data, and resolved differences by consensus. <BR/>The standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group were used to synthesise the data. Effects were expressed as relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data, and weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous data. The fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. </P>
<P>Separate comparisons of the following antibiotic regimens were performed:</P>
<P>1) Beta lactam therapy vs beta lactam plus aminoglycoside</P>
<P>The other pre specified antibiotic comparisons could not be assessed as the studies did not separate data for early and late onset sepsis, and were excluded.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was planned for very low birth weight (less than 1500 g) and/or very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks gestation or as defined by study) as well as developing vs developed countries.</P>

<P>Thirteen studies were identified as possibly eligible for inclusion. Eleven of these studies were excluded (see table of excluded studies). Babies with suspected late onset neonatal sepsis could not be separated from those with suspected early onset sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Adelman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Adelman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Begue-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Begue 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Louvois-1992" TYPE="STUDY">de Louvois 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogel-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fogel 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gokalp-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gokalp 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haffejee-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Haffejee 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammerberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snelling-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Snelling 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiese-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wiese 1988</LINK>). All of these studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Gokalp-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gokalp 1991</LINK>) were randomised and controlled. One study randomised the infants in the suspected early onset sepsis group, but not those in the suspected late onset group (<LINK REF="STD-Snelling-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Snelling 1983</LINK>). One study was originally published in French and required translation into English (<LINK REF="STD-Begue-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Begue 1997</LINK>). The authors of the excluded studies have been contacted (see acknowledgements) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Louvois-1992" TYPE="STUDY">de Louvois 1992</LINK>) is awaiting further assessment regarding separate data for babies with suspected early onset and late onset sepsis.</P>
<P>Two small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Umana-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Umana 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miall_x002d_Allen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Miall-Allen 1988</LINK>) were eligible for inclusion. Both these studies enrolled neonates with suspected late onset sepsis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Umana-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Umana 1990</LINK> enrolled 147 neonates to receive either two beta lactam antibiotics (aztreonam and ampicillin) or combination therapy with a beta lactam plus aminoglycoside (ampicillin and amikacin). They excluded 79 infants without proven infection from analysis, plus a further eight infants, and reported outcomes for 60 neonates with confirmed bacterial infection. The authors of this study confirmed that the study population were neonates more than 48 hours of age. Because of the post-randomisation exclusion of babies without documented infection, which represented 59% of enrolled babies, this study is not currently included in this review but is awaiting further assessment.</P>
<P>The one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Miall_x002d_Allen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Miall-Allen 1988</LINK>) enrolled 28 neonates 48 hours of age or older and compared beta lactam monotherapy (Timentin) with combination therapy comprising beta lactam plus aminoglycoside (Flucloxacillin and Gentamicin). They analysed outcomes for 24 neonates. Three babies were excluded as they had a diagnosis other than sepsis (e.g. congenital heart anomaly) and one was excluded following an incorrect laboratory report. <LINK REF="STD-Miall_x002d_Allen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Miall-Allen 1988</LINK> looked at the outcomes of mortality, treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance. It did not assess any other adverse effects of antibiotic treatment. It included hypersensitivity in the protocol as a reason to stop intervention therapy (Timentin) although the nature of any reaction is not described. The study is described in more detail in the table of included studies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 14:31:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review had to exclude the majority of detected studies. Many of the possibly eligible studies were performed in the 1980's and one in 1978. Although the distinction between early and late onset sepsis in terms of pathogenesis and organisms had been previously described (<LINK REF="REF-Weintzen-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintzen 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feigin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 1977</LINK>) the trials performed did not separate entry and outcome data accordingly. The organisms responsible for causing neonatal sepsis have changed over time with both the use of antibiotics and the introduction of neonatal intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCracken-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCracken 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1990</LINK>). In early onset infection, sepsis is acquired from the mother, usually secondary to ascending infection, and babies are often systemically infected at delivery. In contrast, in late onset (nosocomial) infections, the organism first colonises the baby and only later invades to cause sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1991</LINK>). Increasing survival of smaller, more premature infants leads to increased rates of nosocomial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996 (a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zafar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zafar 2001</LINK>). Studies have documented the timing of onset of neonatal infection and the related organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996 (a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996-_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996 (b)</LINK>). The authors believe that the distinction between early and late infection is an important one and subsequently directs distinct treatment and prevention strategies.</P>
<P>This review found only two studies that specifically compared antibiotic regimens for suspected late onset neonatal sepsis. Both assessed beta-lactam therapy compared with a combination of beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside. One study, however, excluded infants post randomisation who did not have documented sepsis and only reported outcomes for the babies with confirmed infection. Therefore, this study is not currently included, but the authors of the study have agreed to try and access the data for the excluded babies. The included study was randomised. There was no blinding of interventions and outcome measurements, and the outcomes were only short term. The validity of the results is affected by the methodological quality of the included trial.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in mortality (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.23) or treatment failure (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.23) between the groups. Antibiotic resistance was assessed and there were no cases in either group. The included trial may be too small to have shown significant differences in important outcomes such as mortality.</P>
<P>As there was so little data available for this review the authors also analysed the data for the <LINK REF="STD-Umana-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Umana 1990</LINK> study which reported outcomes for the babies with confirmed infection only. This was with the aim of providing the information obtained for readers of this review to both highlight the lack of data on this subject and to direct future research . We will be unable to include the study and pool the data until the outcomes for the babies with suspected infection are known (Please see table of studies awaiting assessment <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). It is important to note that the types of infants in the studies may have been quite different with one study having been performed in a Maternity Hospital and the other in a Childrens Hospital. Both studies took place more than 15 years ago and some of the antibiotics used are not in common use in NICUs today.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Umana-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Umana 1990</LINK> reported outcomes of only the 60 randomised patients with confirmed sepsis. In babies with confirmed infection there was no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.00), however, there was a non-significant trend to a reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08; RD -0.21, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.03) in the beta-lactam group. They found that significantly fewer infants failed to obtain bacteriologic cure in the betalactam group (relative risk 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.77; risk difference -0.33; 95% confidence interval -0.54 to -0.12). The trend to less treatment failure and the significant difference in bacteriologic cure are possibly due to the use of aztreonam in this study. The commonest isolate in their infants was <I>pseudomonas aeruginsoa</I> and there were more infants with this organism in the amikacin plus ampicillin group. These infants had lower bactericidal titres against pseudomonas than the infants in the aztreonam plus ampicillin group. Aztreonam provides excellent Pseudomonas cover but little or no gram positive cover.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials at present to suggest that any antibiotic regimen is superior than another in the treatment of suspected late neonatal sepsis. This review has, however, highlighted a clear lack of research into the benefits and risks of empiric antibiotic regimens in the treatment of suspected late onset sepsis.</P>
<P>Late onset neonatal sepsis is mainly acquired nosocomially. Prevention, therefore, is ideal but despite optimal handwashing, staffing and NICU design, premature infants will continue to develop late onset infection secondary to immature immune responses, invasive devices and opportunistic infections. Knowledge and surveillance of the organisms present in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit may help clinicians to choose the right antibiotic for treating and preventing sepsis. Pseudomonas infection, for example, has an extremely high mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2004-_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2004 (b)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). Neonatal units with very few babies colonised with Pseudomonas should use every reasonable means possible to prevent spread of the organism to other babies and commence antibiotics with pseudomonas cover when invasive sepsis is suspected.</P>
<P>Although surveillance of organisms is mandatory it does not document the harms of treatment. The real difficulty in neonatal infection is in choosing appropriate empiric antibiotic regimens as many neonates with suspected infection are not actually infected. These regimens are typically broad spectrum to cover both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. However, the use of such antibiotic regimens may contribute to the future development of resistant organisms in the neonatal unit. This review was unable to assess other long term harms of treatment such as hearing loss.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials in favour of any particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of suspected late onset neonatal sepsis</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a lack of studies that compare different antibiotic regimens for treating suspected late onset neonatal sepsis. More research is needed into narrow versus broad spectrum antibiotic regimens for suspected late onset infection and particularly into the harms of treatment, both short and long term. In developed countries where coagulase negative staphylococcus is the commonest late onset infection, trials may wish to compare regimens with and without vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside. In developing countries where broad spectrum antibiotic cover is common, ongoing surveillance of types of organisms and increasing antibiotic resistance is particularly important to then direct randomised trials. Any future research also needs to assess cost effectiveness and the impact of antibiotics in different settings such as developed or developing countries and lower gestational age groups.</P>
