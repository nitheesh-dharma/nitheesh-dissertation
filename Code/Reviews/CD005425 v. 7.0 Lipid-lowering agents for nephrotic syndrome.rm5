<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:11:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare disease in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine. A common early sign is swelling in the feet and face. Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include low levels of protein in the blood, and high levels of fats in the blood, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides.</P>
<P>Managing nephrotic syndrome includes therapies to reduce fats (lipids) in the blood. Several types of lipid-lowering agents including statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and ezetimibe can be used.</P>
<P>We looked for evidence from RCTs to establish if lipid-lowering drugs were beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies that investigated four different lipid-lowering drugs (simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil) in 203 participants with nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>There is currently not enough high quality evidence from published studies to determine if lipid-lowering agents are helpful in managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-24 17:44:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-10-24 18:46:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-10-24 18:47:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-11 12:51:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:20:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare condition in which the glomeruli of the kidney leak protein from the blood into the urine. It results in hypoproteinaemia, hyperlipidaemia, lipiduria and generalised oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-Das-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna Das 2002</LINK>). Nephrotic syndrome can result from primary glomerular disease or secondary diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (<LINK REF="REF-Falk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk 2001</LINK>). Primary nephrotic syndrome comprises five histological patterns: minimal-change glomerulonephritis (GN), membranous GN, mesangial proliferative GN, membranoproliferative GN, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-Das-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna Das 2002</LINK>). Nephrotic syndrome usually begins insidiously and presents with oedema in the feet and facial puffiness leading to a general, massive oedema. Urinalysis shows massive proteinuria and degrees of haematuria, and biochemistry demonstrates hypoalbuminaemia (&lt; 3 g/dL) and hypercholesterolaemia (usually more than 300 mg/dL) (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-Das-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna Das 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of hyperlipidaemia</HEADING>
<P>Hyperlipidaemia is a common feature of nephrotic syndrome and patients present with elevated total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may be normal. Lipoprotein(a) concentrations may also be elevated (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1994</LINK>). The degree of hyperlipidaemia correlates directly with the severity of the proteinuria, and inversely with the serum albumin (<LINK REF="REF-Appel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Importance of treatment for hyperlipidaemia</HEADING>
<P>Animal studies have suggested that hyperlipidaemia escalates progression of glomerular injury (<LINK REF="REF-Bagga-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayslett-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayslett 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keane 1994</LINK>). Accelerated atherosclerosis in the kidney vascular system may contribute to deteriorating kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Falk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk 2001</LINK>). Observational studies in the general population have shown that lipid abnormalities are associated with a reduction in kidney function (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and have higher prevalence of hyperlipidaemia (or dyslipidaemia) than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Culleton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culleton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1998</LINK>). Many studies have elucidated the relationship of coronary artery disease with hypercholesterolaemia (<LINK REF="REF-_x0034_S-Group-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">4S Group 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATP-II-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATP II 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ordonez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordonez 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1995</LINK>). Several clinical trials have established that reduction of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol in high risk people is associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_EAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/EAS 2011</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:15:15 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many approaches to lowering blood lipids. In addition to drug therapy, lifestyle changes including low-fat diets and physical activity, as well as functional food and dietary supplements such as fish oil (rich in long chain n-3 fatty acids), polycosanol, and red yeast rice may be useful. There are several categories of lipid-lowering agents used to treat patients with hyperlipidaemia. Statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors), bile acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and nicotinic acid are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia; and fibrates, nicotinic acid, and n-3 fatty acids are used for the management of hypertriglyceridaemia. Statins, fibrates, nicotinic acid, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors are used for the modulation of HDL cholesterol levels.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:23:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Statins are first-line lipid lowering agents and are recommended for use in the ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_EAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/EAS 2011</LINK>). Statins reduce cholesterol synthesis in the liver by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity. The reduction in intracellular cholesterol concentration induces LDL receptor expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which results in increased extraction of LDL cholesterol from the blood and a decreased concentration of circulating LDL cholesterol and other apoB-containing lipoproteins including triglyceride-rich particles. Thus, statins also decrease elevated triglyceride levels and induce a modest increase in HDL cholesterol. Reports have indicated that statins lowered LDL cholesterol levels by 20% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_EAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/EAS 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second-line agents such as bile acid sequestrants or nicotinic acid can be used for patients who develop minor adverse effects from a statin or who are unable to tolerate reduced doses or another statin (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bile acid sequestrants prevent bile acid entry into the blood and thereby remove a large portion of bile acids from enterohepatic circulation. Decreases in bile acid returned to the liver leads to up-regulation of key enzymes responsible for bile acid synthesis from cholesterol, particularly CYP7A1. The increase in cholesterol catabolism to bile acids results in a compensatory increase in hepatic LDL cholesterol receptor activity, clearing LDL cholesterol from blood circulation and thus reducing LDL cholesterol levels. Studies have shown that bile acid sequestrants can lower total cholesterol levels by up to 30% when used alone, and can further reduce LDL cholesterol by 20% to 40% when used with statins (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_EAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/EAS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valeri-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valeri 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nicotinic acid has multiple beneficial effects on serum lipids and lipoprotein (<LINK REF="REF-Kamanna-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamanna 2008</LINK>). It has been reported that nicotinic acid decreased fatty acid influx to the liver and VLDL cholesterol secretion by the liver. Nicotinic acid has been reported to inhibit diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 in the liver resulting in decreased secretion of VLDL particles from the liver, which is also reflected in reductions of HDL and LDL particles. Nicotinic acid raises HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) primarily by stimulating apoA1 production in the liver. Nicotinic acid is currently used mostly as an extended release form. Nicotinic acid at 2 g daily has been reported to be effective in reducing triglyceride by 20% to 40%, LDL cholesterol by 15% to 18%, and to increase HDL cholesterol by 15% to 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Kamanna-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamanna 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ezetimibe is the first drug in a new class of cholesterol lowering agents called cholesterol absorption inhibitors. It has a unique mechanism of action compared in that it inhibits the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, decreasing intestinal absorption by 54%. Ezetimibe does not affect absorption of triglycerides or fat-soluble vitamins (<LINK REF="REF-Ezetimibe-PI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezetimibe PI 2002</LINK>). Fibrates, including gemfibrozil and clofibrate, can reduce cholesterol by 10% to 30%, lower plasma triglycerides, and may increase HDL levels (<LINK REF="REF-Falk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk 2001</LINK>). Fibrates have been reported to be effective in lowering fasting and post-prandial triglyceride levels and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnant particles. The HDL cholesterol-raising effects of fibrates are modest (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:26:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although data from post hoc analyses of statin studies provide evidence for the beneficial effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with stages 2 and 3 CKD; negative results from a study evaluating rosuvastatin in subjects on regular haemodialysis questioned the benefits of statins in these very high risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>). Although statins are generally well tolerated at moderate doses by people with CKD stages 1 and 2, safety issues in those with more advanced CKD (stages 3 to 5) needs further investigation; adverse events are commonly dose-related and related to increased blood concentration of the compound. For those with dyslipidaemia who are unable to tolerate statins, efficacy of alternative second-line agents such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid are unproved.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (such as adverse events) results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes (such as serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, SCr) were assessed using the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used (e.g. proteinuria). In studies where change from baseline data were reported, the change scores were to be used. Where final values were reported, we use final scores only.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:56:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were only able to identify five small studies enrolling 203 patients, and therefore were unable to perform meta-analyses for the majority of our planned outcomes. One study (40 participants) reported a significant increase in HDL cholesterol in those treated with statins compared to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2009</LINK> (52 participants) reported statin treatment significantly increased serum albumin levels when compared to no treatment. There were no significant differences reported by the studies for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, SCr, BUN, or proteinuria between the statins and control group. There were no significant differences reported in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, apoA, apoB, SCr, BUN, proteinuria, serum albumin, serum total protein between fibrates and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Buyukcelik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukcelik 2002</LINK>). All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke were not reported in any of the included studies.</P>
<P>All studies reported adverse events. Three studies reported liver enzymes remained normal (no data provided) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>) reported one case of elevated liver enzymes in the statins group. Three studies reported CPK without providing data. One study reported CPK values fluctuated in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Olbricht-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olbricht 1999</LINK>) and the other studies reported normal levels (<LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2002</LINK>) and no significant difference between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2009</LINK>). There were no reported incidences of rhabdomyolysis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-28 16:58:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified a number of significant gaps in the evidence. We found no studies that compared ezetimibe, nicotinic acid, or bile acid sequestrants with placebo or no treatment. Only some of the many statin and fibrate preparations available were investigated; none compared one preparation with another. Poor reporting meant that issues concerning compliance and timing could not be elicited. Limited data meant that we were unable to incorporate histological and aetiological characteristics of nephrotic syndrome in our results.</P>
<P>Supportive therapies were provided to participants in most studies, including administration of ACEi and corticosteriods, and restricting dietary cholesterol intake.</P>
<P>Most participants had been diagnosed with primary nephrotic syndrome. However, it remains unknown if evidence from these patients can be extrapolated for people with secondary nephrotic syndrome. Comedications and nephrotic syndrome type may therefore be major issues to be considered around applicability of the evidence to clinical practice and patients.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> present the risk of bias summaries. The methodological quality of included studies was suboptimal. Although <LINK REF="STD-Buyukcelik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukcelik 2002</LINK> was judged to be at low risk of bias for selection (allocation concealment), performance, detection and attrition bias, none of the included studies described random sequence generation, and all were judged to be at high risk for reporting bias. Since data were insufficient, synthesis was not undertaken for the majority of outcomes. With the exception of statins for three months and total cholesterol (<LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>), all other results were based on single study data. Although there was potential clinical heterogeneity in two studies, which may have been attributable to different use of statins (<LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>), data were synthesised.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-10-28 17:00:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol. A comprehensive search strategy was used and main medical databases such as the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register which contain the reports from many sources including non-English journals were searched. Two authors selected studies independently using our prespecified inclusion criteria and screened study titles, abstracts and full texts to avoid selection bias. Quality assessment of studies was performed by two authors using the risk of bias assessment tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>There have some limitations of this review; of the five studies included none reported all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Data for some important outcomes were unavailable, for example, SD for serum cholesterol in <LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2002</LINK>. Therefore data synthesis and subgroup analysis for most outcomes were not possible. Secondly, only two of the studies provided diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Buyukcelik-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Buyukcelik 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olbricht-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olbricht 1999</LINK>). The definition of participants with nephrotic syndrome was crucial for the evaluation of curative effects. Furthermore, due to insufficient detailed information of the study process we judged for some risk of bias items as being 'unclear'. All the above may have contributed to potential biases.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-28 17:01:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no other systematic reviews investigating the use of lipid-lowering agents in patients with nephrotic syndrome. <LINK REF="REF-Appel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1990</LINK> reported that gemfibrozil decreased LDL cholesterol in people with nephrotic dyslipidaemia; however this was not the case in our review. <LINK REF="REF-Appel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 1990</LINK> also reported that HDL cholesterol was either increased or unchanged during statin treatment. One study in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2004</LINK>) reported an increase in HDL cholesterol after lovastatin treatment. Lipid-lowering agents had no effect on the degree of proteinuria. This was inconsistent with findings reported by <LINK REF="STD-Gheith-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gheith 2009</LINK> which indicated improvement in proteinuria in the statin group compared with no treatment. Although many studies have reported that statins confer favourable effects on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_EAS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/EAS 2011</LINK>), we found no similar effects in people with nephrotic syndrome.</P>

<P>The included studies were suboptimal in terms of quality; most results were supported by only one or two studies meaning data could not be pooled for many of our outcomes. No eligible studies considering other categories of lipid-lowering agents, such as nicotinic acid and bile acid sequestrants were identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-10 18:12:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More robust and relevant studies are needed. The effectiveness and safety of lipid-lowering agents for participants with nephrotic syndrome need to be investigated. Future researchers should consider focusing on comparisons of lipid-lowering agents, including nicotinic acid and bile acid sequestrants, with placebo or no treatment. Studies should be designed and undertaken over a long enough time period to measure important outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction.</P>
