<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The last updated and published review in November 2004 included 49 trials with 4790 randomised participants. Most trials had poor study quality. Results suggested a beneficial effect of supplementation for percentage weight change from 34 trials (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 2.7) and a reduced mortality in the supplemented groups compared to the control groups from 32 trials (relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 2.7).</P>
<P>Sixty-two trials with 10,187 randomised participants have been included in the current update. Most included trials had poor study quality. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) for percentage weight change showed a benefit of supplementation of 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 2.5) from 42 trials. There was no significant reduction in mortality in the supplemented compared with control groups (relative risk (RR) 0.92, CI 0.81 to 1.04) from 42 trials. Mortality results were statistically significant when limited to trials in which participants (N = 2461) were defined as undernourished (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97). The risk of complications was reduced in 24 trials (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99). Few trials were able to suggest any functional benefit from supplementation. The WMD for length of stay from 12 trials also showed no statistically significant effect (-0.8 days, 95% CI -2.8 to 1.3).</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-02 13:32:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Much emphasis is placed on the importance of good diet, usually in relation to concern about the health risks of obesity. However it has been generally agreed that the risk of undernutrition rather than overnutrition is the main cause for concern in elderly people, particularly those who are hospitalised or institutionalised. Malnutrition has been shown to have important effects on recovery in a broad range of patients and conditions. It has been associated strongly with impaired immune response, impaired muscle and respiratory function, delayed wound healing, overall increased complications, longer rehabilitation, greater length of hospital stay and increased mortality. Oral protein and energy supplements are potentially safer and easier to administer than nasogastric enteral feeds and are therefore particularly suited to elderly people and are also widely used. However, there may be problems with the willingness and ability of older people to consume oral supplements, and supplements may not be used effectively. Even if supplements are prescribed, they may not always be given, or are given but not consumed. In addition to taste, the composition and timing of administration in relation to meals may be important. Efforts also need to be made to provide normal meals and snacks which meet the needs of elderly people and to provide assistance with feeding if required.</P>
<P>A total of 10,187 randomised participants from the 62 trials has been included. Maximum duration of intervention was 18 months. The reviewers suggest that supplementation appears to produce a small but consistent weight gain. There was no evidence in this updated review of a beneficial effect on mortality overall, but there may be a beneficial effect on mortality in people who are undernourished. Supplementation may also reduce the number of complications. The reported acceptance of supplements was variable between trials. Some adverse effects such as nausea or diarrhoea were reported. However, there were problems of study design and quality. More studies are required to confirm the beneficial effect on the number of complications, to establish whether there is a beneficial effect on mortality for undernourished elderly people and to provide evidence about whether protein and energy supplements can improve morbidity and functional status in frail older people.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-02-18 12:07:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of nutritional supplements containing protein and energy, often prescribed for older people, is limited. Malnutrition is more common in this age group and deterioration of nutritional status can occur during illness. It is important to establish whether supplementing the diet is an effective way of improving outcomes for older people at risk from malnutrition.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review examined trials for improvement in nutritional status and clinical outcomes when extra protein and energy were provided, usually as commercial 'sip-feeds'.</P>

<P>Supplementation produces a small but consistent weight gain in older people. Mortality may be reduced in older people who are undernourished.

<P>Much emphasis is placed on the importance of good diet, usually in relation to concern about the health risks of obesity. However it has been generally agreed that the risk of undernutrition rather than overnutrition is the main cause for concern in elderly people, particularly those who are hospitalised or institutionalised (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1988</LINK>). There have been recent UK and international initiatives to improve practice in this area of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Council-Europe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Council Europe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHSQIS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSQIS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no universally accepted clinical definition of malnutrition or undernutrition (the terms are used interchangeably here). However, <LINK REF="REF-Allison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 2000</LINK> defined undernutrition as "a state of energy, protein or other specific nutrient deficiency which produces a measurable change in body function and is associated with worse outcome from illness as well as being specifically reversed by nutritional support".</P>
<P>Increased length of hospital stay is associated with malnutrition. Studies have reported the presence of malnutrition in a substantial proportion of hospital patients both on admission and during hospital stay in the USA, Norway, Ireland, UK, Sweden, The Netherlands and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Bistrian-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bistrian 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bruun-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruun 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corish-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corish 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edington 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flodin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruizenga-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruizenga 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zador-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zador 1987</LINK>). This is a particular problem for elderly people as a) over 40% of hospital admissions are elderly people who have longer periods of illness and longer hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-HCUP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">HCUP 2002</LINK>), and b) data show that elderly patients are more at risk of malnutrition than others (<LINK REF="REF-Gallager_x002d_Allred-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallager-Allred 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruizenga-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruizenga 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McWhirter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhirter 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reasons for poor nutritional status in older people are multi-faceted and include the physiological, psychological and social changes associated with aging which affect food intake and body weight, exacerbated by the presence of illness. Five to ten percent of elderly people in the community may also be malnourished (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 1997</LINK>). Elderly people who are already malnourished at home may be at a disadvantage if admitted to hospital for treatment. Within Europe and the USA, nutritional status has been shown to decline with hospital stay due to a lack of adequate nutritional intake during hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Corish-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corish 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McWhirter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhirter 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1999</LINK>). This is because the poor nutritional state of many patients often goes unrecognised and there may be a lack of awareness of malnutrition by health professionals who receive little training on nutritional issues (<LINK REF="REF-Elia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2001</LINK>). Disease or treatment such as surgery may also increase nutritional demands, so patients who have a poor appetite or difficulty eating will lose weight.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement of nutritional status</HEADING>
<P>Commonly used methods to measure nutritional status are body mass index (BMI) (weight in kg / height in m<SUP>2</SUP>), anthropometry such as triceps skin fold thickness and arm muscle circumference, and history of recent weight loss. Serum albumin has also been used as a measure of nutritional status as malnutrition causes a decrease in the rate of synthesis of albumin, but serum albumin levels are known to be affected by changes in fluid balance and illness itself. Illness, injury and age may all therefore confound the measurement of nutritional status. Improved tools for nutrition risk screening have been developed, which include subjective measures of recent weight loss and inadequate intake (<LINK REF="REF-BAPEN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAPEN 2003</LINK>). The difficulty of defining and measuring nutritional status may help explain some of the wide variation in the reported prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalised adults of between 11% and 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Corish-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corish 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects of malnutrition</HEADING>
<P>Malnutrition has been shown to have important effects on recovery in a broad range of patients and conditions. It impacts on both physiological and biochemical systems and has been associated strongly with impaired immune response, impaired muscle and respiratory function, delayed wound healing, overall increased complications, longer rehabilitation, greater length of hospital stay and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windsor-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windsor 1988</LINK>). Apathy, depression, fatigue and a loss of will to recover have been demonstrated following weight loss in experimental volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1950</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>The economic consequences of malnutrition are also considerable. In 1992 the economic cost to the United Kingdom National Health Service of preventable malnutrition was estimated to be £266 (297 EUR, 2009 currency translation) million a year, mainly due to increased length of bed occupancy and associated treatment costs (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1992</LINK>). More recently, it has been estimated that the annual additional health care cost of malnutrition and associated disease is over £5.3 (5,9 EUR, 2009 currency translation) billion in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Elia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elia 2005</LINK>). However more studies which gather information regarding the cost-effectiveness of nutritional support are required.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-02 11:46:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Oral supplements are potentially safer and easier to administer than nasogastric enteral feeds and are therefore particularly suited to elderly people and are also widely used. However, there may be problems with the willingness and ability of older people to consume oral supplements, and supplements may not be used effectively. Even if supplements are prescribed, they may not always be given, or are given but not consumed (<LINK REF="REF-Peake-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peake 1998</LINK>). In addition to taste, the macronutrient composition and timing of administration in relation to meals may be important (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>). Efforts also need to be made to provide normal meals and snacks which meet the needs of elderly people and to provide assistance with feeding if required.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-19 10:42:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A systematic review in 1998 examined the effects of oral and enteral protein and energy supplementation in adults from thirty eligible trials which were identified up to the end of 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1998</LINK>). Outcomes assessed were change in body weight and arm muscle circumference, and case fatality. There were indications that nutritional supplementation was associated with improvements in outcomes assessed. However, uncertainties remained, because of the poor quality of included trials.</P>
<P>The present Cochrane review of older adults, when last updated and published in January 2005 included 49 trials with 4790 randomised participants. Most trials had poor study quality. Results suggested a beneficial effect of supplementation for percentage weight change from 34 trials (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 2.7) and a reduced mortality in the supplemented groups compared to the control groups from 32 trials (relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 2.7).</P>
<P>Other reviews have included a review of randomised and non randomised studies in different diagnostic groups with chronic non malignant disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Akner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akner 2001</LINK>) suggesting that patients with certain disorders (such as hip fracture) may be more likely to benefit than others. <LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2003</LINK> and colleagues also extensively reviewed the evidence base for nutritional support in a recently published book, including a review of 166 randomised and non-randomised trials of oral nutritional support published up to 2002 in all ages, across different disease groups, both in hospital and in the community.</P>
<P>A recent update of the systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2006</LINK>), of nutritional supplementation for hip fracture aftercare in older people, included 21 trials involving 1727 participants. There was some evidence that oral protein and energy feeds (evaluated by eight trials), reduced unfavourable outcome (death or complications), but there was no demonstrable effect on deaths alone in participants recovering from hip fracture. However overall, the evidence was still weak due to defects in the reviewed studies, particularly inadequate size, methodology and outcome assessment.</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review of dietary advice for illness-related malnutrition in adults of all ages has also been carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2008</LINK>). Thirty-six studies (37 comparisons) met the inclusion criteria with 2714 randomised participants. No comparison showed a significant difference in mortality. There were several significant results for change in weight and other nutritional indices favouring nutritional intervention, but it remains uncertain whether nutritional supplements and dietary advice produce the same effects. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about clinical outcomes and cost. For specific information on dietary advice for illness related malnutrition, the reader is referred to <LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Elderly people who are ill and malnourished may be expected to benefit more from supplementation. Providing higher energy supplements over a longer duration may also be expected to be associated with greater benefit. The present review includes a more comprehensive search for randomised trials to specifically examine the effectiveness of oral protein and energy supplements for elderly people.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-11-19 10:43:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>To assess the effects and acceptability of oral dietary supplements in both hospitalised elderly people and elderly people in the community, irrespective of setting:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in outcomes between participants who were given oral nutritional supplements compared to those participants who were given no intervention, a placebo, or an alternative supplement with a different amount of calories and protein.</LI>
<LI>to carry out subgroup analysis in order to assess whether participants who were malnourished, were ill, were aged 75 years or over, were given supplements of 400 kcal or more or who had longer duration (35 days or more) of supplementation showed most benefit.</LI>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-02 13:46:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Ideally studies were randomised controlled trials, but we also considered quasi-randomised controlled trials (for example allocation by day of week, date of birth, alternation). We only accepted trials that had a minimum duration of two weeks (with a minimum duration of intervention of one week). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>To be defined as elderly, groups of study participants had to have a minimum average age of 65 years. All groups were included, with the exception of groups exclusively of older people in critical care or recovering from cancer treatment who may have had specific nutritional needs relating to their condition. Mixed groups of patients, where some were recovering from cancer and some had been undergoing critical care were included. Efforts were made to obtain data for the groups of interest from the authors.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-19 10:43:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Interventions were aimed at improving the intake of protein and energy using only the normal oral route. Protein was provided together with non-protein energy sources such as carbohydrate and fat, and with or without added minerals and vitamins. We were interested in supplements in the form of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>commercial sip feeds;</LI>
<LI>milk based supplements;</LI>
<LI>via the fortification of normal food sources.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies of dietary advice alone were not included in this review. We also excluded studies of specially designed immunomodulatory supplements or supplements of specific amino acids. The comparison intervention was 'usual practice' (for example using no supplement or an alternative supplement with a different amount of calories and protein) or a placebo (for example a low energy drink). Although protein-only supplementation has occasionally been used for experimental purposes, it would not be considered for routine use and was therefore excluded.</P>

<P>Methodological quality was assessed by two reviewers (either AA and AV or AM and JP) all differences were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer if necessary. A sensitivity analysis was carried out based on the quality assessment. The assessment protocol scored each item between nil and two as described below. In addition, risk of pre-allocation disclosure of assignment was rated A, B or C according to the Cochrane Handbook 1997. The following aspects of internal and external validity was reported and assessed:</P>
<P>a) Was the assigned treatment adequately concealed prior to allocation?<BR/>2 = method did not allow disclosure of assignment (A)<BR/>1 = chance of disclosure of assignment or states random but no description (B)<BR/>0 = quasi-randomised (C)</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-02-02 12:30:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Data were combined for meta-analysis for dichotomous variables mortality and number of patients with complications as described in the protocol. In those studies where the data were reported as the total number of complications instead of the number of affected patients, it was assumed that there was one outcome per patient. For each study relative risks and 95% confidence limits were calculated, the results were combined using fixed-effect models and presented with 95% confidence limits. Where there was evidence of heterogeneity a random-effects model was applied. Heterogeneity between comparable trials was explored using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) using more than 50% as the cut-off for significant heterogeneity. A funnel plot to assess small study bias for mortality data was also carried out.</P>
<P>Data for length of hospital stay were combined for meta-analysis as a continuous variable. Data were combined for meta-analysis from studies which provided length of stay data as mean number of days and standard deviation. If the data were provided as the median and interquartile range, the median was used instead of the mean and the standard deviation estimated from the interquartile range. Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a fixed-effect model which assumes the same underlying effect in all studies and considers any heterogeneity between trials to be due to random errors. A random-effects model was also used if there was any evidence of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Data were also combined for meta-analysis for percentage weight change and arm muscle circumference (AMC) and as described in the protocol. Weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models as appropriate for changes in weight and anthropometry measures. The trials reported body weight and anthropometric measures in several ways. For meta-analysis the same method was used to standardise data as used previously by <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1998</LINK>. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage change in body weight during the trial period was selected as the measurement of choice because of its clinical relevance (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1998</LINK>). Where percentage weight change was not available the difference was calculated between the initial and final body weight, expressed as a percentage of baseline weight and a standard deviation of 10% inferred. This standard deviation was conservative, and at the upper limit of any of the observed results. As in <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1998</LINK>, if baseline weight was not reported, a standard value of 60 kg was assumed, which applied to all patients regardless of their nutritional status. Assumptions made regarding standard deviations were checked by restricting the analysis to those trials where no inferences were made. As in <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1998</LINK>, arm muscle circumference (AMC) was chosen as the anthropometry measure as it is both a measure of fat and muscle. Where this was not described in a trial it was derived from the mid-arm circumference or mid-upper arm circumference (MAC / MUAC) and triceps skinfold (TSF) using a standard formula (<LINK REF="REF-Gurney-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurney 1973</LINK>). Anthropometry data were then pooled as weight data.</P>
<P>Data were also combined for meta-analysis for change in handgrip strength where this was provided or could be calculated from the data provided. Weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were again calculated using the fixed- and random-effects model as appropriate.</P>

<P>In addition to the twenty-one thousand titles / abstracts which were identified using the above database search strategies and through hand searching and reference list searching, in 2001, another twelve thousand titles / abstracts were identified for the 2005 update and an additional 28 studies identified for the present update (20 full reports, one ongoing study and seven abstracts). From the database search, reading the abstracts or reading the full article allowed most to be eliminated because they clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. This left an additional 18 potentially relevant trials. Two reviewers independently assessed these trials and as a result of mutual agreement, 13 additional trials have been included to date (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).

<P>Six of the included trials also examined the effects of exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Bonnefoy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bonnefoy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meredith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Meredith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>), with the same exercise component in both the supplemented and control groups. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bonnefoy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bonnefoy 2003</LINK> a factorial design was used with participants receiving either exercise or memory training.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 10,187 randomised participants from the 62 trials has been included. Studies were carried out in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Approximately 55% of participants were female (no information on gender was provided in seven studies). The mean age reported in studies varied from 65 to 88 years (not reported in seven studies). The number of participants in trials varied greatly between 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1992</LINK>) and 4023 (<LINK REF="STD-FOOD-trial-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD trial 2005</LINK>), 42 trials had fewer than 100 participants.</P>
<P>Although studies took place in a variety of settings, most participants (71%, 26 studies) were hospitalised in-patients with acute conditions. Other participants were either in long-stay / care of the elderly / continuing care wards or nursing homes (14%, 15 studies), or at home in the community (15%, 21 studies). Forty studies (48% participants) included older people with no specified disease or condition, except some trials where some or all patients had Alzheimer's disease. Other studies included patients with hip fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruce-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Delmi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Delmi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hankins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tidermark-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tidermark 2004</LINK>), stroke patients (<LINK REF="STD-FOOD-trial-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD trial 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gariballa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gariballa 1998</LINK>), patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (<LINK REF="STD-Broqvist-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Broqvist 1994</LINK>), patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="STD-Deletter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Deletter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saudny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saudny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schols-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schols 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vermeeren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeeren 2004</LINK>), older surgical patients (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacFie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacFie 2000</LINK>) and patients at home with diabetic foot ulcer (<LINK REF="STD-Eneroth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eneroth 2004</LINK>). Apart from diagnosis being considered as a marker of nutritional risk (for example post-surgery, COPD, hip fracture), 60% of participants in the included trials underwent screening and were then classified as actually being undernourished or at nutritional risk. The definition for this (for example weight, BMI, unable to eat independently) varied between studies and was often not provided, very few studies used weight loss as an indicator of nutritional risk. Separate data were provided for those well nourished and undernourished in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 2001</LINK>) and these have been analysed separately as appropriate in this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The interventions used in the trials aimed to provide between 175 additional kcal/day and up to a maximum of 1350 additional kcal/day. Additional protein was between 10 g protein/day and 50 g protein/day. Less than 400 kcal/day was provided in 20 trials, 400 kcal/day or more in 32 trials, and the energy supplemented was not known for ten trials.</P>
<P>Thirty-five trials reported using supplements with at least some vitamins and minerals, or both, one gave equivalent vitamins to the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Carver-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carver 1995</LINK>), one also gave extra vitamins to some patients in a factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-Vlaming-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vlaming 2001</LINK>), two trials gave calcium and vitamin D supplements to both the intervention and control group (<LINK REF="STD-Hampson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hampson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tidermark-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tidermark 2004</LINK>), 27 trials did not report vitamin content or it was unclear, although the majority of commercial supplements do provide vitamins and minerals. <LINK REF="STD-MacFie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">MacFie 2000</LINK> had a control group and three groups receiving supplements (pre-operative supplements only, post-operative supplements only, and both pre and post-operative supplements), those receiving supplements have been grouped together.</P>
<P>When reported, supplements were given twice daily for around 31% of participants, but this could also be between one and four times or any number of times for the remaining participants. Thirty-nine trials used named commercial supplements, the others did not specify a manufacturer. Commercial supplements may have been provided by the manufacturer free of charge, although this was not often explicitly stated. Extra milk alone was provided for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Barr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 2000</LINK>), and low lactose milk powder was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kwok-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kwok 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The minimum time period of the intervention was 10 days, the maximum was 18 months. The length of time of the intervention was less than 35 days for 17 trials, and 35 days or more for 37 trials, from admission to discharge in five trials and the intervention period was unclear for two trials. The duration of follow-up was generally the same as the duration of the intervention, and varied from one week to 18 months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes assessed</HEADING>
<P>Most trials assessed nutritional outcomes, particularly weight change and dietary intake, but also change in anthropometry. Mortality was not the principle outcome for most trials. Morbidity and complications and length of hospital stay were provided in a limited number of trials. The majority of trials also included a measure of functional status, however these were often disease specific and too diverse for meta analysis. Sixteen studies measured the effect of supplementation on quality of life. Only one trial provided data on cost effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Edington-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Edington 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>For details see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. The method of scoring used is described above (quality assessment of trials). Concealment of allocation was confirmed in only 19 studies which used computer allocation or sealed opaque envelopes. A clear 'intention to treat' analysis was only carried out in 24 studies. The quality was poorest with regard to blinding. Action to ensure blinding of outcome assessors was reported in only 12 studies, action to blind participants in 16 studies, and blinding of treatment providers was reported in only 14 studies.</P>

<P>Post-hoc subgroup analyses for mortality based on diagnostic group suggested that the results were statistically significant when including only trials in patients with a variety of geriatric conditions (N = 2701), (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98), where most of these participants were in hospital. However, there was no demonstrable benefit for patients with hip fracture (N = 437), (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.66) from eight small trials. The limited data from other diagnostic groups such as stroke patients and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) did not suggest a reduction in mortality.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen trials discussed adverse effects from supplementation, in most cases no comparison with the control group was performed, six reported no adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Delmi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Delmi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McWhirter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McWhirter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saudny-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saudny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tidermark-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tidermark 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wouters-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wouters 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Weight change</HEADING>
<P>Measures of weight were converted into percentage weight change to allow data from 42 trials with 3058 participants to be included in the meta-analysis. Percentage change in body mass index (BMI) was used as a proxy measure for weight in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bonnefoy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bonnefoy 2003</LINK>). A standard deviation of 10% was assumed in 20 studies as described previously.</P>
<P>There was a mean weight loss during the trial period for the supplemented group in seven trials, this contrasts with a mean weight loss in 23 trials for the control group. The pooled weighted mean difference for percentage weight change showed a benefit of supplementation of 2.2% (1.8 to 2.5) with no significant heterogeneity (chi-square 52.35; df 43; P = 0.16; I<SUP>2 </SUP>=17.5%).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:56:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Supplementation appears to produce a small but consistent weight gain. There was no beneficial effect on mortality overall, but there was a reduction in mortality in undernourished groups and in general geriatric populations which were mainly hospitalised patients. There was a beneficial effect on the number of complications, particularly in hip fracture patients. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay. There was little evidence of benefit to functional outcomes or quality of life.The updated review was dominated by the large international <LINK REF="STD-FOOD-trial-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD trial 2005</LINK> which tested the hypothesis that adding oral protein-energy supplements to standard hospital diet until discharge would improve outcome at six months after stroke. The trial contributed 4023 of the 10,187 randomised participants in this review, with only a minority (8%) of the <LINK REF="STD-FOOD-trial-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD trial 2005</LINK> participants classified as undernourished at baseline. The results of the trial suggest that it is unlikely that routine oral supplementation in well nourished stroke patients is useful. The trial did not answer the question about whether routine oral supplements may have a role to play in the management of undernourished patients.Care must be taken with the inclusion criteria for participants in order to achieve external validity. Trials ideally should have included a representative sample of elderly people who would under normal circumstances be eligible for oral nutrition support. Severely malnourished patients who are likely to benefit most have not been included in many trials for ethical reasons. Furthermore, many trials did not adequately screen participants for nutrition risk or malnutrition. The inclusion of marginal candidates for nutrition support in trials may mask the benefits of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1997</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>The subgroup comparison of 'undernourished' versus 'not undernourished' was based on a definition of undernourished that was not the same for all trials. Unfortunately there were not enough data provided to stratify the subgroups using a standard measure of nutrition risk such as body mass index or recent weight loss. No single trial was adequately powered or long enough to investigate mortality as a primary outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Morbidity, functional status and quality of life</HEADING>
<P>The definition of complications was also not the same for all trials although most complications were infection related.</P>
<P>Few studies were able to provide data on improvements in functional status or quality of life in general, apart from handgrip data. Measures were too diverse or too limited to combine for meta-analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Length of stay</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-FOOD-trial-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD trial 2005</LINK> with a slightly longer average stay for supplemented stroke patients dominated the results for the meta-analysis of length of hospital stay with supplementation, although non significant, the trend is still towards a slightly shorter stay for supplemented patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nutritional status</HEADING>
<P>The pooled weighted mean difference for percentage weight change in this study showed a small but consistent benefit from supplementation, and there was no evidence that assuming a standard deviation in so many trials biased the results. The evidence from most trials suggested that supplements, if taken, produce weight gain. However we do not know the composition of that weight gain, which could be a gain in fat mass, muscle mass or both. In terms of providing functional benefit, a gain in fat mass may have cosmetic benefit but will not improve muscle strength. Results from <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK> suggested that exercise is also required to produce a significant improvement in muscle strength and function. Trials involving patients living at home provided supplements for periods of between six weeks and six months, with quite modest gains in weight. In the absence of more evidence of benefit for older people in the community, long-term supplementation at home may not be cost-effective.</P>
<P>The pooled weighted mean difference for percentage change in arm muscle circumference (which is a measure of both lean and fat tissue) in this study suggested a very small benefit of supplementation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intake</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that nutritional supplementation may significantly reduce the intake of ordinary diet (<LINK REF="STD-Bastow-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bastow 1983</LINK>), and this obviously would reduce the effectiveness of supplements. However, the majority of studies reported that supplementation significantly increased total daily protein intake, energy intake or both. It should, however, be remembered that it is very difficult to measure nutrient intake with any degree of accuracy, and few assessors of intake were reported as being blinded to treatment status.</P>
<P>There was one notable exception to the findings above. Results of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK> suggested that after 10 weeks of supplementation the supplemented participants did not increase their total energy intake significantly compared to the controls, despite high compliance with the supplements, which was offset by a reduction in normal food intake.</P>
<P>We also do not know yet which component(s) of the supplement may be providing the beneficial effect if any, specifically, whether it is actually the energy and protein that is important or the provision of extra vitamins and minerals from the supplement or all of these. Assessing this was made difficult because it was not clear in many studies whether vitamins and mineral were actually included in the supplements.</P>
<P>At least 10 trials also included some dietary advice as part of the intervention. Furthermore, participants at home received regular phone calls or visits. It is not known what influence this might have had, although it seems likely that this would improve compliance and outcomes. A recent systematic review of dietary advice alone to patients with illness related malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2008</LINK>), would suggest that it is difficult to disentangle the different effects of advice and supplements.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Compliance (acceptance of the supplement)</HEADING>
<P>The literature suggests that under normal conditions acceptance of supplements can be a problem for elderly people. This review does not include studies examining only the acceptability in terms of taste of different kinds of supplements for this age group. Problems with acceptance or adverse events such as nausea, gastro-intestinal discomfort were reported in a few studies. From this review there was no evidence that participants at home were less compliant with supplementation than those in hospital or long term care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-02-18 12:41:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The review was limited because the quality rating of included trials as reported was poor, particularly for blinding of outcome assessors, participants and treatment providers. Blinding of participants and treatment providers cannot be done without a placebo, and it can be difficult to have an untreated arm for ethical reasons in some trials. Without a placebo group bias may result from supplemented patients receiving a higher standard of care and attention from treatment providers. It should be possible however, to design a trial where the outcome assessors are blinded to the treatment allocation. The fact that this was only done (or at least reported) in 17 studies was a major deficiency of the review and may bias the results towards finding a more beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Analysis of outcomes on an 'intention-to-treat basis' was also deficient and this also potentially represents a source of bias. There was inadequate reporting of numbers of participants who were allocated and assessed, and reasons for losses to follow-up were often not reported. Some patients were excluded from the analysis because they were unable or willing to take the supplements. If the outcomes from all patients had been included in the analysis, then the results would be more representative of the effectiveness of supplements under real life conditions.</P>
<P>The beneficial effect of supplementation on mortality was still evident when only higher quality trials with adequate allocation concealment were included, and also when trials with substantial proprietary involvement were excluded from the analysis. There was therefore no evidence that the commercial trials that did report on mortality, were more likely to report favourable outcomes. But there is a general concern that selective reporting of outcomes such as mortality, could have introduced bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-02 14:59:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The results of the present review, which included more than twice the number of patients than the previous version of this review, supports the findings of the previous review in that there is a small weight gain, but no longer supports the finding that there is a beneficial effect on mortality overall. However, mortality in undernourished patients may be reduced. There is more evidence of a reduction in complications than in the previous review. Results however still require to be substantiated as there are doubts due to many included trials having poor study quality.</P>
<P>Although proprietary sip feeds have become a widely accepted means of improving nutritional status, it is not enough to provide supplements and hope for the best. Under normal circumstances patients should have a variety of options for increasing intake. In hospital or long-term care, at the very least, a choice of attractive and acceptable food should be offered along with dietary advice if required. Furthermore, elderly people may become more malnourished because they do not get assistance with feeding on a busy ward, and encouragement and assistance may be all that they require. There were too few randomised trials that had considered other methods of supplementation such as altering the nutrient density and diversity of the diet, which may be preferable to sip-feeds for some elderly people, and also few trials which had tried to improve the way that the sip-feeds were provided in order to improve acceptability and reduce wastage. However proprietary protein and energy supplements used appropriately with nutritionally 'at risk' patients have a useful role to play as part of a raft of measures which should be used to improve the intakes and nutritional status of older people in hospital or long-term care.</P>
<P>For older people in the community who are at risk, it is also important to consider both dietary ways (for example meals-on-wheels) and non-dietary ways (for example treatment of depression, correction of dental problems and exercise regimes) of improving intakes and nutritional status before they are admitted to hospital. More evidence of benefit from oral nutritional supplements for older people at risk of malnutrition in the community is still required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-18 11:59:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Large scale multi-centre pragmatic trials of interventions to improve nutritional status of elderly people, particularly malnourished elderly people from clearly defined patient groups (such as patients with hip fracture) are still required. Most individual studies in this review had an intervention time that was too short to have a realistic chance of detecting differences in morbidity, functional status or quality of life. Future trials need to have sufficient statistical power and length of follow-up to be able to detect any beneficial effects. Future trials of nutritional supplementation should also have properly concealed allocation, blinding and follow-up of all participants to ensure that those who are not able to consume the supplements, are included (intention-to-treat analysis). Trials should also focus more on primary outcomes of relevance to patients such as improvement in function or quality of life measures.</P>
