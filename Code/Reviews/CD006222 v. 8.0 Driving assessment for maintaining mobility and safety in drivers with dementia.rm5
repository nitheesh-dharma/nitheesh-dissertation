<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-03 15:11:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The proportion of older people in the world is increasing and consequently the number of older drivers is also on the rise. Older people commonly depend upon private motor vehicles for their transport needs and so assessment of older drivers with cognitive impairment is becoming increasingly important. We have reviewed the literature on driving assessment in people with dementia for two reasons. First, we wished to see if assessment helped people with dementia and good driving skills continue driving. Second, we wished to discover whether assessment was useful in preventing road traffic accidents.</P>
<P>Although many authors have studied the motor skills, neuropsychological performance and driving behaviour of drivers with dementia, we found no study that randomised drivers to evaluate these outcomes prospectively following assessment. This highlights the need for caution in applying the literature on driving assessment to clinical settings as no benefit has yet been prospectively demonstrated. It also indicates the need for prospective evaluation of new and existing models of driver assessment to best preserve transport mobility and minimise road traffic accidents.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-03 15:08:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Demographic changes are leading to an increase in the number of older drivers: as dementia is an age-related disease, there is also an increase in the numbers of drivers with dementia. Dementia can impact on both the mobility and safety of drivers, and the impact of formal assessment of driving is unknown in terms of either mobility or safety. Those involved in assessment of older drivers need to be aware of the evidence of positive and negative effects of driving assessment. Cognitive tests are felt by some authors to have poor face and construct validity for assessing driving performance; extrapolating from values in one large-scale prospective cohort study, the cognitive test that most strongly predicted future crashes would, if used as a screening tool, potentially prevent six crashes per 1000 people over 65 years of age screened, but at the price of stopping the driving of 121 people who would not have had a crash.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-21 09:20:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-03 15:15:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>With an increasingly aged population, the number of older drivers is on the increase. Driving is the most common form of transport for older people, with only 3% of journeys by older people in the US undertaken by public transport. Transport and access to transport is an important factor in maintaining social inclusion and participation for older people: there is also considerable evidence that limiting this access (i.e. by driving cessation) is associated with poor health and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Marottoli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marottoli 2000</LINK>). Exclusion of elderly people from driving has been demonstrated to have many negative effects: loneliness, lower life satisfaction and lower activity levels. Drivers with dementia limit their driving and eventually withdraw, with profound negative effects on their mobility (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>We do not know what interventions will maintain safe mobility for the longest period for people with dementia. A full assessment (often including an on-road assessment) may have beneficial effects for drivers with many illnesses apart from dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Stutts-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stutts 2003</LINK>), and restricted driving licenses following assessment for people with medical conditions other than dementia are associated with a lower crash risk (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 2002</LINK>). An assessment in dementia also allows for advance planning of driving withdrawal and substitution of other transportation modalities, by way of the so-called modified Ulysses pact (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2004</LINK>). It also allow for regular re-testing to guide this process (<LINK REF="STD-Duchek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duchek 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is no standardised neuropsychological assessment battery, most driving assessment protocols include medical, occupational therapy, neuropsychology assessment, or a combination of these, and an on-road driving assessment as required. We have no evidence that this intervention enhances either mobility or safety in people with dementia.</P>
<P>We sought evidence that formalised driving assessments are effective in maintaining mobility and safety in drivers with dementia rather than merely excluding those who are unfit to drive. Continued driving and outdoor mobility is important to older people and is a sufficient outcome measure in its own right. Safety is arguably a secondary end point, as crashes are relatively infrequent events, and fatal crashes even more so (1 per 50 million km). RCTs of driving assessment should involve a careful design, randomising people who drive to either formal testing or usual care and assessment, with longitudinal follow-up of satisfaction with transport (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbloom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbloom 2003</LINK>) and crashes or violations.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-21 09:20:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The importance of transportation to health and social inclusion of older people, and in particular, older people with dementia, must be recognised. Helpful studies in this regard are <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2001</LINK>, which showed an unmet shortfall in transport requirement and provision for drivers with dementia who stop driving, and a public health paper by <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>, which found that after controlling for other factors, driving cessation was associated with a higher risk of entry to nursing home. This relative lack of attention to transportation may also have societal roots, as indicated by a review of newspaper articles on older drivers, whereby the overwhelming emphasis was on safety rather than mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A second issue arises from a failure, as yet, to incorporate modern theories of driver behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Ranney-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranney 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 2005</LINK>) into existing driver assessment procedures, which almost invariably emphasise cognitive measures. These may play a less determining role in driving efficacy in mild to moderate dementia than is commonly understood. An exception to the cognitive approach can be seen in the work of <LINK REF="REF-de-Raedt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Raedt 2000</LINK>, which uses a hierarchical and behavioural approach, and which seems to show promise in off-road assessment of drivers who have been noted to require driving assessment by physicians or state authorities.<BR/>There may be other methodological difficulties encountered in carrying out driving research. Testing may be challenging for the person, as described by <LINK REF="STD-Snellgrove-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Snellgrove 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, and some may choose to give up driving rather than take a test. Faced with the threat of a test, the older driver may withdraw from driving, and enter the traffic in a more dangerous capacity, that is, as a pedestrian (<LINK REF="REF-Hakamies_x002d_Blomqvist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakamies-Blomqvist 1996</LINK>). One study has suggested it also led to an increase in the relative number of unsafe older drivers based on an increase in crashes per license following the introduction of mandatory testing (<LINK REF="REF-Langford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langford 2004</LINK>). Safety, legal and ethical implications for subjects and assessors carrying out road testing can also create significant obstacles to participation and study design. With the potential for fatal crashes at stake, the tenor of the vast majority of these narratives and descriptive studies is negative - directed towards driving cessation rather than preserving and enhancing mobility - and therefore restrictive from the point of view of the consumer undergoing assessment. They tend to focus on negative outcomes, which, although serious, are, in fact, rare and in doing so reinforce a negative stereotype on a large number of older drivers with cognitive impairment. Another methodological and practical consideration influencing the types of studies available is that identifying risk factors for crashes or cessation can be accomplished by relatively easy adaptation of existing databases or cohort studies. Intervention studies are inherently more time and cost intensive. To undertake intervention studies for rare outcomes such as crashes would require large sample sizes, a prevalent risk factor to target, and a reasonably effective intervention for that risk factor.</P>
<P>In order to appraise the available literature we approached the evidence from the point of view of the consumer and of evaluating physicians and used the following questions to illustrate what is known, what is inferred and what remains to be established.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Will assessment maintain transport mobility?</HEADING>
<P>No study reviewed has discussed long-term transport mobility outcomes for people who passed or failed evaluations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Will assessment prevent crashes or fatalities?</HEADING>
<P>No study has evaluated this question.</P>
<P>In the absence of RCTs of both potential benefits and negative consequences from driving assessment, it is reasonable to consider conducting prospective trials of assessment versus no assessment, but with an independent safety committee reviewing the outcomes regularly during the course of the trial. However a trial of no assessment will not be feasible in regions with legally mandated specialised assessments for people with dementia. Another approach, in regions without standardised assessment of drivers with dementia, may be a trial of standardised testing (by office or road test) versus usual care with outcomes of transport mobility, time to driving cessation, crash or adverse driving behaviour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. What outcome measures might be used to measure transport mobility?</HEADING>
<P>Transport mobility is poorly studied as most research focuses on driver safety, and is hampered by lack of a concise definition or screening instrument, for example, someone may have good transport support and access to services while not driving (i.e. due to good family support), or may hold a license and insurance but may not feel that they have good transportation (through fear of rush hour traffic, difficulty with hospital parking lots). Conceptual models of transport mobility have been outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Rosenbloom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbloom 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Metz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metz 2000</LINK> in an attempt to operationalise aspects of mobility not captured in existing studies but as yet there is little consensus on appropriate measures of transport mobility. <LINK REF="REF-Spinney-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinney 2009</LINK> used data from the General Social Survey in Canada and showed a significant decline in transport mobility benefits in the domains of psychological benefits, exercise benefits, community-helping and community-socialising with increasing age. This decline in transport mobility was associated with a significant decline in quality of life but driving was not specifically measured. A further, but not co-terminous, measure is driving cessation, which may stand as a useful rough measure, particularly in jurisdictions such as the US where public transport usage by older people is very low and does not increase after driving cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Giuliano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuliano 2003</LINK>). Increasing interest is also focusing on multi-modality of transport in older populations, the demographic group within which dementia is most common (<LINK REF="REF-Satariano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satariano 2012</LINK>)</P>

<P>This is an area fraught with methodological pitfalls as demonstrated by <LINK REF="REF-Hakamies_x002d_Blomqvist-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakamies-Blomqvist 1998</LINK> and as such there is mixed evidence that drivers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia will have an increased crash rate. Few authors have attempted a prospective study on crash rate. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK> found a positive correlation between neuro-psychological tests (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and Complex Figure Test Recall (CFTR)) with prospective crash rate. They also assessed participants on a driving simulation and a composite score from all the neuropsychological tests, which correlated with each other but not with prospective crash rate. <LINK REF="STD-Ott-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ott 2008</LINK> prospectively evaluated driving performance in participants with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls at six-month intervals. They found that the rate of motor vehicle accidents was not significantly different at baseline and that over the initial 18 months more crashes were observed in the control group but that after correction for miles driven this difference was not significant.</P>
<P>Crash rates have been suggested to be higher in retrospective studies; however, these studies are dependent on the accuracy of recalled information and results have differed considerably when data are collected from participants, carers or police records. <LINK REF="STD-Stutts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stutts 1998</LINK> looked at cognitive performance and found that although the association with retrospective, state-recorded crashes in older adults was present the effect was small (less than two-fold increase comparing the top and bottom deciles on cognitive scores) and they were not able to identify a cut-off point that identified a significantly higher risk of crash. <LINK REF="STD-Trobe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trobe 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 2000</LINK> suggested that there was no increased risk of crash in people with dementia who's Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1994</LINK>) score was between 0.5 and 1 when looking at state recorded crash rates rather than those recalled by subjects, carers or relatives. This may represent a difference in the types of crashes reported to local authorities and although we can reasonably infer that more serious crashes are more likely to be recorded and that retrospectively recalled events may be less accurate, we have no comparative data on these systems of reporting. Parker's paper has built on previous evidence to show that driving errors are not well correlated with future crashes but previous violations were (<LINK REF="STD-Parker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2000</LINK>). This may go some way to explain the discrepancy between high failure rates on road tests and low reported accident rates. Retrospective odds ratios (OR) for crash comparing drivers with dementia and with no dementia have been reported from 7.9 by <LINK REF="STD-Friedland-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Friedland 1988</LINK> to 10.7 by <LINK REF="STD-Zuin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zuin 2002</LINK>. These studies show a marked difference with respect to numbers of subjects, which may help explain the variable strength of the associations (Trobe: n = 858, Carr: n = 121, Zuin: n = 87, Friedland: n = 50). A much larger study involving 3238 older drivers applying for re-licensing had cognitive tests (Trail Making tests A and B, American Association of Retired Persons Reaction Time test and Short Blessed Cognitive screen) compared with State crash records for the previous three years (<LINK REF="STD-Stutts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stutts 1998</LINK>). In that time frame there were 411 crashes including 97 crashes by 45 people, an annual average of 0.043 crashes per person. The investigators found an OR of approximately 1.5 for crashes comparing drivers with cognitive performance in the lowest decile to those in the highest decile. Unfortunately this study did not document a history of dementia in any driver or use cognitive assessments that would allow a diagnosis of dementia, so extrapolating these data to drivers with dementia is difficult. We might infer that the lowest decile of cognitive performance group included at least some people with dementia but the magnitude of the effect on crash risk is unknown.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that it is a study of older drivers and does not diagnose or identify a diagnosis of dementia in any participant or group, the Maryland Prospective Older Driver Study (<LINK REF="STD-Staplin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Staplin 2003</LINK>) can be useful to demonstrate some of the difficulties encountered in driving research. In this paper, 2508 adults over 55 years of age were screened using cognitive and physical performance measures in Maryland. Subjects were recruited by random invitation from all licensed drivers, by medical referral and at re-licensing at a senior citizens residential area. This had the advantages of a prospective follow-up for a mean of 20 months following assessment for crash and moving violation outcomes in a large population-based sample. They suggest, based on peak ORs for crash in each of four cognitive tests that cut-off points can be identified for increased risk of crash and high risk requiring intervention. ORs for crash at the following cut-points were: Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (Visual Closure subtest) (MVPT/VC): 5 incorrect, OR 4.96; Trail Making Test, Part B: 180 sec, OR 3.5; Cued/Delayed Recall: 2 incorrect, OR 2.92; Useful Field Of View subtest 2: 300 msec, OR 2.48. Using raw data in the paper we may extrapolate some values for sensitivity and specificity based on the strongest predictor, MVPT/VC, as a screening tool. MVPT/VC of 5 or more correctly predicted 18 crashes had 258 false positives, 93 false negatives and 1503 true negatives in the 1872 participants who had valid test results. This gives us a positive predictive value of 93%, negative predictive value of 94% and a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 85%, respectively. If we look at the test as an intervention to prevent crashes, then we will need to screen 143 older drivers in order to prevent one crash in the following 20 months and an additional 20 drivers will fail testing.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Driving test performance?</HEADING>
<P>There are reports that drivers with MCI and AD will have a high failure rate on driving tests from which we might infer a higher risk of crash; however, rates of driving test failure vary considerably and, with the exception of Anderson's paper quoted above (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005</LINK>), none of these estimates have been validated prospectively. <LINK REF="STD-Snellgrove-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Snellgrove 2005</LINK> reported the highest driving test failure rate in a non-peer reviewed paper for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. However, this was a highly selected group (consecutive referrals to a memory clinic) with no control group but they did demonstrate an extremely high rate of failure on their road test: 70% of the group of 117 subjects with predominantly early dementia (80%) and MCI (20%). Of particular concern was their finding that 50% of the group required a physical intervention by the assessor to prevent a crash (a finding that has not been reported in any other paper). They also found that 50% of the MCI group failed the road test. Similarly, 41% of 55 participants with dementia were reported to fail the road test in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> and 63% of 19 subjects for <LINK REF="STD-Fox-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1997</LINK>, 36% of 96 subjects with cognitive impairment in <LINK REF="STD-Kay-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kay 2009</LINK>, 65% of 99 subjects with dementia in <LINK REF="STD-Carr-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 2011</LINK> but only 18% of 65 drivers with dementia in <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2010</LINK>. Comparative data versus controls were found in <LINK REF="STD-Duchek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duchek 2003</LINK>, which gives test failure percentages of 30% versus 3% for people with and without dementia, and from <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2006</LINK>, 37% versus 0%. <LINK REF="STD-Ott-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ott 2008</LINK> showed an increased hazard ratio for test failure of 3.51 in people with established dementia (CDR 1.0) versus early dementia (CDR 0.5) in a prospective study over 18 months. In addition, the CDR 1.0 group also showed a higher rate of driving cessation: only 31% of the CDR 1.0 presented for re-test at 18 months compared to 48% of CDR 0.5. Road test failure rates in <LINK REF="STD-Berndt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Berndt 2008</LINK> were 34% for CDR 0.5, 58% for CDR 1.0 and 95% for CDR 2.0. Interestingly one person with CR 2.0 passed the road test suggesting that there may be some merit in offering a road test to people who wish to avail of the opportunity irrespective of their cognitive testing.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Driving simulator performance?</HEADING>
<P>Simulators have also demonstrated higher rates of adverse driving behaviours in studies by <LINK REF="STD-Rebok-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rebok 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Frittelli-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frittelli 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vaux-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vaux 2010</LINK> and also crashes (<LINK REF="STD-Rizzo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uc-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Uc 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Frittelli-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frittelli 2009</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">5. Is there documented evidence of negative effects of assessment?</HEADING>
<P>The numbers of older people who would decline voluntary testing are significant. In the Maryland Programme of Older Driver Screening, 53% of a sample of 3974 older drivers declined driver screening offered to them (<LINK REF="STD-Ball-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 2006</LINK>). There was no difference in retrospective crash rate for those screened and those who declined and, unexpectedly, participants were more likely to be involved in prospective crashes. This sample was taken from older people presenting for re-licensing and participants were not assessed for the presence of dementia. Unfortunately there was no mention of comparative mobility and continued driving rates in the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Snellgrove-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Snellgrove 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> also reported on those who refused on-road testing: 36% to 54% of those who refused said that they would rather give up their license rather than re-test. Both of these studies and also <LINK REF="STD-Stutts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stutts 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duchek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duchek 2003</LINK> indicate that these subjects do not differ from the experimental group in age, sex and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score so we might infer that it reflects a population of people who may have normal driving skill who are negatively influenced by the assessment process with the attendant risks of depression, isolation and social exclusion suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Marottoli-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marottoli 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Marottoli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marottoli 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ragland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragland 2005</LINK> and also early entry into nursing homes (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>). Data from both <LINK REF="STD-Meuser-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meuser 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 2009</LINK> show that the combination of the test failure rate and a lack of appeals or applications for re-testing meant that 90% to 96.5% of drivers reported as impaired did not resume driving. Unfortunately, neither study documented the effect on crashes or traffic violations or on the health of reported drivers.</P>
<P>Driver screening for cognitive impairment has also been shown to lack utility and is associated with increased traffic fatalities in a study that looked at the impact of a decision by the Danish government to add a brief cognitive status examination to medical screening of older drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Siren-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siren 2012</LINK>). This is against a background of other studies that consistently support the hypothesis that mandatory medical testing of older drivers is not associated with reduced fatalities, and indeed that older drivers in the jurisdictions without testing had a significantly safer traffic record (<LINK REF="REF-Hakamies_x002d_Blomqvist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakamies-Blomqvist 1996</LINK>; <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006222.pub2/full#CD006222-bbs2-0073">Langford 2004</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">6. What assessment measures should be used?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neuropsychology</HEADING>
<P>Although studies of older drivers without dementia have shown evidence that office-based tests correlate with future crashes, this has not been evaluated in drivers with a diagnosed dementia. What can be said is that in studies that included people with diagnosed dementia, office-based tests correlate, grossly and without helpful cut-off points, with road test performance and driving simulator performance. Also many studies have shown the strongest correlation between road testing requires a composite of multiple tests (<LINK REF="STD-Rizzo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2006</LINK>), which may limit their use to trained individuals and require lengthy assessments. Clark's composite was more realistic (MMSE, Trail Making test-A and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-block design) with a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 90%, respectively, but it remains to be established that such an assessment is independently adequate to disqualify drivers or merely a screening tool to identify those requiring road testing. There is little evidence that simple tests alone are as effective as road tests. Their most likely role is in screening to identify those in need of more detailed evaluation. Even with composite tests, such as the Stroke Driver Screening Assessment (SDSA) (<LINK REF="REF-Nouri-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nouri 1992</LINK>), adjustment has been needed for stroke in international populations (<LINK REF="REF-Lundberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundberg 2003</LINK>), and have needed to be used in other combinations of instruments for Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Radford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radford 2004</LINK>) and dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2006</LINK>). The Nordic version of the SDSA has been shown to be effective in evaluating stroke drivers but had poor sensitivity and specificity in drivers with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Selander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selander 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behaviour/driving specific</HEADING>
<P>The model of assessment suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Michon-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michon 1985</LINK> and operationalised by <LINK REF="REF-de-Raedt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Raedt 2000</LINK> uses a hierarchical and behavioural approach to the driving task. Michon's model of selection, optimisation and compensation describes successful adaptive strategies in individuals with disability. Examining driving behaviour in similar terms may help identify those able to overcome increasing levels of disability - physical or psychological. De Raedt's model examined driving behaviour in three hierarchies: <I>strategic</I> behaviours involved in planning destinations and routes and avoiding hazardous weather or traffic conditions; <I>tactical</I> refers to anticipatory behaviours such as speed adaptation; <I>operational</I> behaviour is the physical performance of the task (examined in most studies). De Raedt showed high levels of strategic behaviours in those performing badly on road tests but who did not have high accident rates. High accident rates were more associated with low tactical performance scores. This adds an extra dimension to assessment and may help explain the apparent discrepancy between high test failure rates and low per capita crash rates as well as some of the variability in the studies quoted. This model was used by <LINK REF="STD-Grace-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grace 2005</LINK> in a small study with 21 in each group comparing participants with AD, Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. In this study, test failure was rare: only two of the AD group and none of the other two groups failed the road test. However, errors were more common in AD and Parkinson's disease groups, with strategic, tactical and operational errors observed in people with AD while only tactical errors were observed in people with Parkinson's disease. This may suggest that a single standardised test will not be suitable in all older drivers or even all neurologically impaired drivers and a tailored approach may be necessary. Another approach that has more congruence with modern concepts of driver behaviour is that of self efficacy, and an early study in stroke (an illness with high levels of cognitive impairment) has shown promise (<LINK REF="REF-George-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2007</LINK>).</P>

Simulators have obvious advantages, allowing detailed assessment in a safe and controlled environment; however, they have not been shown to predict prospective crashes and some authors feel they are not correlated well with the driving task in older drivers and drivers with dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Bylsma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bylsma 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizzo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzo 2001</LINK>). There is also considerable variation in the technology involved ranging from computer-based simulations (<LINK REF="STD-Rebok-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rebok 1994</LINK>) to scale-model vehicles that simulate audiovisual data in addition to momentum (<LINK REF="STD-Rizzo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rizzo 2001</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dementia type</HEADING>
<P>AD is specifically evaluated in most studies although many of the studies did not specify which dementia subtypes were within the experimental group or did not use consistent and clinically useful criteria (such as CDR or NINDS) to document disease severity. Vascular dementia (VaD) is rarely tested and then usually as a part of an unselected dementia population. No subgroup analysis or specific studies of driving in VaD were identified. <LINK REF="STD-Fitten-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fitten 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zuin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zuin 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2010</LINK> were the only studies identified that specifically mentioned including a number of subjects with VaD but did not look at differential outcomes due to small numbers. Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) has only been evaluated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Simone-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Simone 2007</LINK>), which showed a higher rate of crashes and errors in a simulated drive but only enrolled 15 subjects and 15 controls. <LINK REF="STD-Zuin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zuin 2002</LINK> did comment on a particularly high incidence of adverse driving behaviour in FTD but this only accounted for two out of 87 subjects and no further analysis was attempted. <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2010</LINK> also included  a small number of people with VaD, FTD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but the numbers were too small to yield significant results. Other forms of dementia are almost never evaluated in studies despite reasonable suspicion of higher risk with deficits in perceptual skills and impaired judgement and disinhibition, for example, in DLB. It would seem logical to suggest that deficits of people with VaD, FTD and DLB may not correlate well with the studies on people with AD and would need specific studies to validate driving assessment techniques.</P>

As discussed earlier, <LINK REF="STD-Ott-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ott 2008</LINK> showed a significant difference in prospective driving performance according to CDR score reinforcing the value of road testing in earlier stages of AD and in at least one case in a person with a CDR score of 2.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Functional tests</HEADING>

It bears mentioning though in that this is the first study that had a component looking at mobility and driving cessation. Newer data from the study, however, indicate that the predictive value of functional tests may decrease with increasing time since assessment, although the predictive value of delayed recall and rapid pace walk was preserved (<LINK REF="STD-Staplin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Staplin 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Collateral history is useful but may be misleading and subject to positive and negative bias. <LINK REF="STD-Wild-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wild 2003</LINK> showed more accurate prediction of driving ability from carers than people with AD but not for healthy older people. However, carers' assessment of functional impairments can be influenced by the burden placed on a carer's time (<LINK REF="REF-Zanetti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti 1999</LINK>) and carers may have vested interests in a person's continued driving, in the example of a non-driving spouse. This may explain the higher crash rates estimated by carers as found in <LINK REF="STD-Friedland-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Friedland 1988</LINK>. Despite this, dementia research in other fields lends credence to the collateral history, which can be a more accurate estimate of cognitive and functional decline (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2007</LINK>).</P>

The majority (88.8%) of these automatic suspensions were for cognitive impairment. No data have been presented on whether this measure improves safety on Oregon's roads.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Meuser-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meuser 2009</LINK> described a system where introduction of voluntary reporting of impaired drivers in Missouri led to driving cessation in 96.5% of 4100 reported individuals, 50% of whom did not seek any further assessment. This measure did lead to a reduction in crashes in this group but the study did not look at the impact on mortality or morbidity outcomes for this group other than motor vehicle accidents.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary</HEADING>
<P>Our findings, therefore, continue to demonstrate a deficit in the transport literature for people with dementia. Despite considerable international variation in the regulatory and legislative processes for driving assessment in people with dementia there is no evidence from RCTs or prospective studies that driving assessment will help maintain mobility or improve safety for drivers with dementia. The subject of mobility outcomes after driving assessment has been overlooked thus far. Drawing on the literature for the larger numbers of older driver, little evidence has, so far, been forthcoming that there is any benefit in these driver screening programmes. Studies evaluating driving skills in people with dementia are fraught with methodological difficulties and are largely focused on rare outcomes such as crashes and therefore rely on surrogate markers such as cognitive tests, driving simulators and road tests. The overwhelming majority of these tests have not been evaluated prospectively in people with dementia and so can only offer speculative data on crash risk. Finally, given the evidence of negative effects of mandatory assessment and driving cessation more prospective data are required regarding positive and negative outcomes for people with dementia who undergo driving assessment.</P>

<P>There is no randomised evidence to indicate whether neuropsychological, on-road or other assessments of driving ability can help support safe drivers to remain mobile, or to reduce crashes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-03 21:41:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>More work is required to identify the optimal assessment strategy to help preserve transport mobility. A key challenge here is the development of a concise measure of transportation resources and quality, as suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Metz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metz 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Screening appears to discriminate unfairly against older drivers and yet in a population who appear to have declining driving skills there is understandable concern about crash risk. Further research is required to develop assessment tools that can reliably identify unsafe drivers with dementia in an office-based setting. Behavioural models may be of benefit here.</P>
<P>RCTs of driving assessment should involve a careful design, randomising people who drive to either formal testing or usual care and assessment, with longitudinal follow-up of satisfaction with transport (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbloom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbloom 2003</LINK>) and crashes or violations. Ethically, this may not pose a public health hazard in view of some memory clinic studies that suggest no increase in crashes in those with dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Drachman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Drachman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trobe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Trobe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carr-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 2000</LINK>). Due care will need to be given to advice to participating drivers on informing driver licensing authorities and insurance companies, depending on the jurisdiction(s) within which the study is taking place. The study should also incorporate regular data review by an independent safety committee. As it is clearly undesirable that all drivers with dementia continue driving indefinitely, the use of a measure of transport efficacy, such as the Life Space Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Stalvey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalvey 1999</LINK>). may be a better guide to the primary question posed. It is likely that a close monitoring of the study for adverse events would be the best guide to the potential hazards, as, given that crashes are infrequent events, a study based purely on the secondary objective of safety would have to be very large. Extrapolating from <LINK REF="STD-Staplin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Staplin 2003</LINK> where 111 out of 1876 participants in the License Renewal Sample crashed in the 20 months' follow-up, giving a crash rate of 0.06 per person over 20 months. Using JMP statistical software (SAS Institute) we estimate that a sample size of 5293 in each group would be required to have an 80% power to detect a 20% difference in crash rate between an unselected older driver population and a dementia group in the same time frame. If, however, we were to choose a larger estimate of increased crash risk such as a 50% difference in crash rates, our required sample size would be 953 per group. For the primary research objective of continued driving, cessation over a 23-month period was almost 50% in a Canadian study of 200 drivers with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 2006</LINK>), giving a withdrawal rate of 0.485 per person over a 23-month period. This would give us a sample size of 2625 in each group to have an 80% power to detect a 10% difference in driving cessation. </P>

As the population ages, the number of elderly automobile drivers can be expected to grow. International experience on the safety of elderly drivers may be useful in anticipating the effects of the growth in the number of elderly drivers in China. Methods: This study reviewed the literatures and summarized the research on elderly driver motor vehicle crash prevention both from China and some developed countries such as USA. Results: Despite elderly drivers driving less as a whole and having higher seat belt compliance, their mileage-adjusted motor vehicle crash (MVC) and fatality rate is higher than any other age group. Visual and cognitive impairment among elderly drivers raises the risk of a MVC, and these conditions cause unique collision patterns. Physical fragility and co-morbidities confer a poorer outcome post MVC compared to younger drivers with equivalent injury severity. Although few elderly drivers in China, data has shown higher rate of traffic injury among elderly, higher fatality of elderly pedestrian, and higher rate of elderly victims in rural area. Conclusion: International experience on the safety of elderly drivers such as better road safety design, highly visible and seatbelt law enforcement, public education in regards to seatbelt use, and adjustment for license renewal period may be helpful to the traffic safety designers and policy makers in China. These issues may also have important implications for injury prevention researchers in identifying elderly driver MVC risk factors, and engineers optimizing the driving environment an&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-10-27 16:49:07 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
