<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-21 15:44:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Renal vasculitis presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which is a form of kidney disease that causes damage to the small structures (glomeruli) inside the kidneys that help filter waste and fluids from blood to form urine. The disease leads to a rapid loss of kidney function. Standard suppression of the immune system with steroids and cyclophosphamide is recommended. The aim of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention for the treatment of renal vasculitis. Thirty one studies (2217 patients) were identified. Plasma exchange reduces the risk of end-stage kidney disease in patients presenting with severe acute kidney failure. The use of pulse cyclophosphamide results in good remission rates but there was an increased risk of relapse. Azathioprine is effective as maintenance therapy once remission has been achieved. Mycophenolate mofetil is equivalent for remission induction than cyclophosphamide. Mycophenolate mofetil has also been tested in maintenance treatment and was found to result in a higher rate of disease relapse. Initial data on rituximab showed equivalent effectiveness to cyclophosphamide. Methotrexate and leflunomide are useful in maintenance therapy but their relative effectiveness are not clearly defined. Treatment with co-trimoxazole may prevent respiratory infections and relapses but are unlikely to have a major impact on systemic relapses of vasculitis.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-21 15:44:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Thirty one studies (2217 patients) were included. Studies conducted earlier tended to have a higher risk of bias due to poor (or poorly reported) study design, broad inclusion criteria, less well developed disease definitions and low patient numbers. Later studies tend to have improved in all areas of quality, aided by the development of large transnational study groups.</P>
<P>Plasma exchange as adjunctive therapy significantly reduces the risk of end-stage kidney disease at three months (2 studies: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78) and 12 months (6 studies: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). Four studies (300 patients) compared the use of pulse and continuous administration of cyclophosphamide. Remission rates were equivalent but pulse treatment causes an increased risk of relapse (4 studies: RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.87) compared with continuous cyclophosphamide. Azathioprine has equivalent efficacy as a maintenance agent to cyclophosphamide with fewer episodes of leucopenia. Mycophenolate mofetil may be equivalent to cyclophosphamide as an induction agent but resulted in a higher relapse rate when tested against azathioprine in remission maintenance. Rituximab is an effective remission induction agent. Methotrexate or leflunomide are potential choices in remission maintenance therapy. Oral co-trimoxazole did not reduce relapses significantly in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-20 10:34:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Plasma exchange was effective in patients with severe AKI secondary to vasculitis. Pulse cyclophosphamide results in an increased risk of relapse when compared to continuous oral use but a reduced total dose. Whilst cyclophosphamide is standard induction treatment, rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil were also effective. Azathioprine, methotrexate and leflunomide were effective as maintenance therapy. Further studies are required to more clearly delineate the appropriate place of newer agents within an evidence-based therapeutic strategy.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-25 17:10:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 17:10:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Renal vasculitis presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) which comprises of a group of conditions characterised by acute kidney injury (AKI), haematuria and proteinuria. Histological examination of the kidney reveals severe inflammation in the form of crescent formation, glomerular necrosis and vasculitis of small and medium sized vessels within the kidney. These conditions include the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease and idiopathic RPGN (<LINK REF="REF-Savage-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1997</LINK>). ANCA-associated vasculitides are generally small vessel vasculitides and include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; previously called Wegener's granulomatosis (WG)), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and renal-limited vasculitis (<LINK REF="REF-Seo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 2004</LINK>). GPA is characterised by granulomatous inflammation usually involving the sinuses, lungs and kidneys. It is usually associated with the detection of cytoplasmic-ANCA (c-ANCA) specific for proteinase-3 (PR3) in the serum of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Jennette-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennette 2003</LINK>). MPA is a small to medium vessel vasculitis in the presence of perinuclear-ANCA (p-ANCA) specific for myeloperoxidase (MPO). Studies often include GPA, MPA and renal-limited vasculitis together as ANCA-associated vasculitides though there is some evidence that they have distinct genetic backgrounds and therefore pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 2012</LINK>). Eosinophilic GPA is also classified as an ANCA-associated vasculitides (<LINK REF="REF-Jennette-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennette 2013</LINK>), but is not specifically included in this review. In the majority of studies, it is excluded. It is a less well defined condition with overlap with other eosinophilic diseases. Evidence increasingly points to the pathogenicity of ANCA (<LINK REF="REF-Jennette-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennette 2008</LINK>). Other conditions also cause vasculitis in the kidney such as Henoch Schonlein Purpura and cryoglobulinaemia resulting in immune deposits visible on electron microscopic examination of renal tissue. The treatment of Goodpasture's disease and other forms of RPGN with granular immune deposits have an entirely separate pathogenesis to the pauci-immune (no immune deposits) forms of the disease and has not be addressed in this review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-25 17:10:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Treatments for vasculitis involve suppression of the immune system and have been highly successful. Mortality of untreated vasculitis was 80% at one year. Recent figures suggest 80% five-year survival with modern immunosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Harper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2011</LINK>). Induction protocols have historically been based around the use of cyclophosphamide (CPA), either daily oral dosing or monthly intravenous (IV) pulses (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savage-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savage 1997</LINK>). More recently anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment has gained some popularity as a primary treatment, though supported by a considerably smaller body of evidence. In the presence of kidney failure, plasma exchange is often used as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pusey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pusey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rondeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rondeau 1989</LINK>). Once remission of the disease is achieved, treatment is scaled back with lower doses of steroids and the induction agent is replaced by a less potent immunosuppressive, such as azathioprine (AZA). Co-trimoxazole has been used in GPA mainly to prevent the occurrence of pneumocystis infection, upper respiratory tract infection and subsequent relapse of disease. Various guidelines are available which summarise available treatment options and some of the evidence for their use (<LINK REF="REF-Lapraik-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapraik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menahem-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menahem 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mukhtyar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukhtyar 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-31 17:05:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There are multiple interventions deployed in this condition. The majority work by suppression of the immune system in various ways. Some of these are well defined whereas others are not. For instance, rituximab works by specifically binding to CD20 a molecule expressed on B cell subsets. It works to inhibit the actions of these cells and reduce levels of antibodies that are thought to be pathogenic in this disease. CPA also is directed against B cells. AZA is an anti-metabolite which inhibits cell proliferation, it tends to inhibit lymphocytes since they have a high rate of cell division. Steroids, also known as glucocorticoids, have a broad immunosuppressive effect via multiple cellular pathways.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-25 16:15:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>These treatments are well established but many questions remain unanswered. Though recent guidelines are comprehensive (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>), optimal agent, dose, duration, route and frequency of treatment are uncertain. CPA can be given as a daily oral dose or in intermittent oral or IV doses (<LINK REF="STD-Adu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adu 1997</LINK>). IV regimens tend to give a lower total dose and have fewer side effects, but give a higher rate of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2011</LINK>). Treatment may also include IV methylprednisolone or plasma exchange but their place in therapy is debated (<LINK REF="REF-Kerr-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levey 1994</LINK>). Other therapies including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), anti-TNF alpha therapy, leflunomide, methotrexate (MTX), anti-adhesion molecule (CD52) therapy and IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Jayne-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayne 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nowack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowack 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tervaert--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tervaert 2001</LINK>) but the randomised controlled trial (RCT) data are limited.</P>
<P>Mortality from this condition remains significant with more than 10% of patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitides dying in the first 12 months after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Little-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 2010</LINK>). Fifty percent of these are caused by treatment side effects.<BR/>

<P>Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used.</P>
<P>The summary measure data were translated into number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) for the observed overall baseline risks. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques. The risk differences with 95% CI were to be calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or compared to another agent, unfortunately there were insufficient studies to do this.</P>

<P>In this review update an additional 18 studies have been included.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Plasma exchange as adjunctive therapy</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis shows that plasma exchange confers a significant benefit to many patients with RPGN by reducing the risk of ESKD at both three and 12 months from diagnosis. <LINK REF="STD-Szpirt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Szpirt 2011</LINK> supports this effect and also suggests that the benefit may be present at five years follow-up. The 12 month RR of 0.45 suggests that the number of patients requiring dialysis may be halved by this intervention. Previous studies have shown an effect in the most severely ill patients. A subgroup analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Pusey-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pusey 1991</LINK> showed a benefit for patients requiring dialysis at presentation. More recently, <LINK REF="STD-MEPEX-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MEPEX Study 2007</LINK> has shown a benefit for patients with SCr &gt; 500 µM with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The majority of patients included in these studies would meet the criteria for having severe AKI (SCr &gt; 500 µM or dialysis required at presentation). It is therefore not clear whether plasma exchange has any impact in patients whose kidney failure is not severe. There was little statistical heterogeneity in all outcomes of these studies with the single exception of SCr at 12 months. Further study of plasma exchange as an induction therapy is underway (<LINK REF="STD-PEXIVAS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">PEXIVAS Study 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>). There has been some debate over the level of certainty that can be applied to this outcome since it relies upon a relatively small number of events. The <LINK REF="STD-PEXIVAS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">PEXIVAS Study 2011</LINK> investigators have therefore included patients with severe kidney failure in their study as well as those with less severe disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pulse versus continuous cyclophosphamide</HEADING>
<P>Pulse treatment with CPA is equivalent to continuous treatment for remission induction, it resulted in a significantly increased risk of relapse at the end of follow-up. None of the studies were powered to answer the question of relapse rate since this would require either much larger studies or significantly longer follow-up. We are therefore reliant on the results of meta-analysis to attempt to provide an answer. This answer is less than perfect since it is a meta-analysis of results at different times post treatment across studies with significantly different protocols. In spite of this, there is no evidence of heterogeneity in the outcome, suggesting that the final result is likely to be valid. This analysis is supported by the recent follow-up data from <LINK REF="STD-CYCLOPS-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">CYCLOPS Study 2004</LINK> showing that patients treated with pulse CPA suffered a 39.5% relapse rate as opposed to 19.8% for continuous daily treatment. Though the rates of relapse with pulse CPA treatment are perhaps discouraging, this does not invalidate this mode of treatment. Pulse therapy still delivers a significantly lower total dose of CPA. For those patients who remain in remission, they have likely benefited in terms of risk of long term side effects.</P>
<P>There is a trend towards more patients requiring dialysis with the use of pulse CPA therapy. This is currently not statistically significant, but the fact remains that there were twice as many patients requiring dialysis after pulse therapy and that this effect is present in all studies. This effect was not confirmed in the long term follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-CYCLOPS-Study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">CYCLOPS Study 2004</LINK>. CPA treatment was given for three months, approximately six months, one and two years in the four relevant studies. This difference may account for the significant level of statistical heterogeneity detected in mortality and the incidence of serious infections. Pulse therapy also caused significantly more nausea but less leukopenia and serious infections. In the light of data from <LINK REF="STD-CYCAZAREM-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CYCAZAREM Study 2003</LINK>, it would seem reasonable to suggest that continuous oral CPA should be limited to three months treatment if the patient has achieved a sustained remission with a change to AZA for maintenance therapy. The optimal regimen for CPA administration for remission induction in ANCA-associated vasculitis remains unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rituximab versus cyclophosphamide alone for remission induction</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> are two well-designed studies showing that Rituximab is equivalent to CPA therapy for remission induction whilst side effects occur at a similar frequency, albeit possibly in a smaller number of patients with rituximab. The difference in remission rates of over 90% in <LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK> and 605 to 70% in <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> at six months is of interest. The studies differed in their patient population (new versus new and relapsed), treatment protocols (rituximab with pulse CPA versus IV pulse CPA (<LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK>) and rituximab alone against oral CPA (<LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK>)), and remission definitions. The patient populations differed in that all patients in <LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK> had kidney involvement as opposed to 52% in <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK>. In a subgroup analysis of these patients in <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK>, 61% of the rituximab group and 63% of the CPA group reached the primary endpoint. This does not account for the difference in remission rates between the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK>, rituximab was given in conjunction with IV pulses of CPA whereas <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> gave rituximab without concomitant CPA. CPA was given orally at 2 mg/kg/d in <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> as opposed to the IV pulses in <LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK>. There is no data to support a higher remission rate from pulse therapy per se. <LINK REF="STD-RITUXVAS-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RITUXVAS Study 2010</LINK> defined remission as a BVAS of 0 for at least two months whereas <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> defined remission as a BVAS of 0 and either no steroid treatment or less than 10 mg/d prednisolone. The latter figures from <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK> are included in this review. The inclusion of steroid doses in the definition of remission may be one of the main influences reducing the apparent remission rate in <LINK REF="STD-RAVE-Study-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RAVE Study 2010</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mycophenolate mofetil for remission induction</HEADING>
<P>The data currently available on this question has improved markedly with the publication of the initial results of <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK>. The data now suggests that MMF is an equivalent induction agent to CPA. The next question is the subsequent relapse rate and this has not so far been addressed. If the relapse rate is particularly high, MMF may simply turn out to be an expensive prelude to subsequent CPA. Data from <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK> will be available later on the relapse rate in their population.</P>
<P>The population of patients studied in <LINK REF="STD-Han-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2008b</LINK> are significantly different from those in other studies, most obviously in the proportion of patients with MPO-ANCA and MPA at 87%. This is significantly different from that reported from Europe where the majority of patients are PR3-ANCA positive. The remission rate is also lower than that achieved in similar studies from Europe with only 44% of patients achieving remission (<LINK REF="STD-CYCAZAREM-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CYCAZAREM Study 2003</LINK>) as opposed to over 90% and in <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK>. The external validity of these studies and wider applicability of their results have improved with <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK> data showing very similar findings in terms of the comparison with CPA. The predominantly European cohort has again shown a higher level of remission induction on both agents.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Han-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2011</LINK> is very similar to <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2008b</LINK>. A very similar population of patients diagnosed with MPA were randomised who were almost exclusively MPO-ANCA positive. <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2008b</LINK> excluded patients with severe and dialysis-dependent kidney failure whereas <LINK REF="STD-Han-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2011</LINK> did not, though there were only nine patients in this subgroup. Both studies treated with CPA for six months regardless of time to remission and outcomes quoted are at six months only. <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK> treated to remission with a minimum of three months CPA and a maximum of six.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methotrexate for remission induction</HEADING>
<P>The single study (<LINK REF="REF-Faurschou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faurschou 2012</LINK>) comparing the use of oral MTX with oral CPA showed that in patients with early disease and SCr &lt; 150 µM, MTX is an effective induction agent. Time to remission may be a little longer with MTX though this was not conclusively shown. Side effects were similar on the two agents. The relapse rate in this study was high and the MTX group had a significantly higher rate than the CPA group. This data has been used to argue that 12 months of treatment is probably not adequate for patients with these diseases, especially for those with GPA who have a greater tendency to relapse. Considering the data on the utility of MTX as a maintenance agent, this study shows that MTX is a useful induction agent for patients with early systemic vasculitis. Longer term follow-up of these patients showed that those treated with MTX had longer periods of treatment with other agents than those initially treated with CPA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intravenous immunoglobulin use for refractory vasculitis</HEADING>
<P>The single study in this area suggests a short term benefit lasting no more than three months (<LINK REF="STD-Jayne-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jayne 2000</LINK>). The treatment can be viewed as a therapy available to help induce remission but has little bearing on the longer term problem of remission maintenance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Etanercept use</HEADING>
<P>The stated aim of the single study into the use of etanercept in systemic vasculitis was to demonstrate that the relapse rate would be reduced (<LINK REF="STD-WGET-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">WGET Study 2002</LINK>). The study failed to show this and also suggested an increase in the incidence of malignancy in treated patients. There is currently no RCT data on the use of infliximab or other anti-TNF agents. There is some possibility that alternative agents may produce significantly different outcomes since their mechanism of action is distinct from that of etanercept. At this point in time there is no RCT data supporting their use.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Lymphocytapheresis and immunoadsorption</HEADING>
<P>Lymphocytapheresis, described by <LINK REF="STD-Furuta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Furuta 1998</LINK>, gives some benefit when compared with three weeks of IV pulse methylprednisolone with a significantly lower SCr in treated patients. There was however no change in either the need for dialysis treatment or mortality at six months. Considering the lack of a comparison with plasma exchange and the recent data suggesting the use of plasma exchange is superior to pulse methylprednisolone, there is currently no compelling reason to consider using this therapy in these conditions. Immunoadsorption, similarly, appears to have no benefit over the use of plasma exchange.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Duration of cyclophosphamide induction</HEADING>
<P>This single study claimed to show a higher relapse rate for six pulses of CPA delivered over four months, as opposed to 12 pulses over 10 months (<LINK REF="STD-Guillevin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guillevin 2003</LINK>). The numbers used in this review include only MPA patients whereas the original paper also included PAN. The relapse rate was high in the PAN patients treated with six pulses and this gave a significant result on survival analysis. Including all patients in our analysis still did not quite reach statistical significance. This study does not reflect current practice and has in some ways been superseded by <LINK REF="STD-CYCAZAREM-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CYCAZAREM Study 2003</LINK> which compared a short to a long course of CPA but also included maintenance therapy in the form of AZA. With the inclusion of patients with PAN, the absence of maintenance therapy and its inadequate size, this study is rather difficult to interpret.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Azathioprine as maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>The use of AZA as maintenance therapy after an initial three month treatment with CPA is strongly supported by the data from <LINK REF="STD-CYCAZAREM-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">CYCAZAREM Study 2003</LINK>. The number of relapses on AZA is similar to CPA with fewer episodes of leukopenia and similar numbers of infections. As well as the data on reduced leukopenia, the reduction in total dose of CPA is presumed to reduce longer term side effects from CPA such as infertility and neoplasia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Azathioprine versus mycophenolate mofetil for maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE Study 2003</LINK> was designed to test the hypothesis that MMF would be superior to AZA in remission maintenance but showed the opposite with an increased risk of relapse with MMF. Interestingly the separation of the groups started within the first 12 months of maintenance therapy when patients were treated at full dose of MMF. Major relapses appeared after the first year and could perhaps be due to a reduction in therapy. The study is clear, however, in rejecting MMF as a superior alternative to AZA for maintenance therapy. The lack of efficacy as a maintenance agent might suggest that its potency in remission induction is unlikely to exceed that of CPA. This is currently being tested in <LINK REF="STD-MYCYC-Study-2007" TYPE="STUDY">MYCYC Study 2007</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Azathioprine versus methotrexate for maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WEGENT-Study-2008" TYPE="STUDY">WEGENT Study 2008</LINK> showed that the safety and efficacy profiles of MTX and AZA are comparable. This data clearly places MTX as a better maintenance agent that MMF since it gave similar relapse rates to AZA. The dosing regimen for MTX in this study was superior to that in the leflunomide/MTX study since the rate of rise in dose was faster and the final dose higher (<LINK REF="STD-Metzler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Metzler 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Leflunomide or methotrexate for maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>The single study of leflunomide suggests that this may be an appropriate treatment for patients who are intolerant of AZA (<LINK REF="STD-Metzler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Metzler 2007</LINK>). There are problems with interpretation and the external validity of this study. The dose of MTX was increased very slowly. Many commentators felt this to be an inadequate dose, potentially causing the higher relapse rate and inadequately reflecting the potential of MTX in this area. There were also a high number of adverse events in the leflunomide arm. The study does however give some data on the use of leflunomide and grounds for its clinical use. Final conclusions are difficult to draw. Further study of leflunomide is warranted as induction therapy and in comparison to AZA as maintenance therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pre-emptive therapy for relapse</HEADING>
<P>Two studies showed that patients will relapse less often on low level immunosuppression with either AZA or CPA plus prednisolone rather than no change in their treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Boomsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boomsma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tervaert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tervaert 1990</LINK>). It is difficult to interpret anything else from these studies. At the time they were undertaken, there was some suggestion that an asymptomatic rise in ANCA titre was likely to be a good predictor of imminent relapse. Current literature does not support that hypothesis. <LINK REF="STD-Boomsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boomsma 2003</LINK> was published as an abstract only. It would be interesting to know how many of the patients without an asymptomatic rise had a subsequent relapse. The abstract notes that after immunosuppression, patients went on to have relapses. Those treated did not appear to benefit from a long term protection from relapse.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antibiotics for maintenance of remission</HEADING>
<P>The use of co-trimoxazole to maintain remission was examined by <LINK REF="STD-Stegeman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stegeman 1996</LINK>. This study showed a benefit in reducing the risk of relapse but not on other outcomes. Analysis in the paper by life table analysis showed this result to be statistically significant. On our analysis, it is not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Relapses detected in the study were mainly respiratory in nature but 11/23 patients with a relapse also had progressive glomerulonephritis. <LINK REF="STD-Zycinska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zycinska 2009</LINK> adds some data to this but still does not clearly answer the question. There were some major limitations in the reporting of this study. Patients were said to be in remission at randomisation but the mean BVAS of the placebo group was 11 (remission is 0). There was no reporting of relapse, only numbers of patients in remission. A firm conclusion is not possible on the available data.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cyclosporin versus cyclophosphamide for maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>The limited data available suggest that there may be a higher relapse rate with the use of cyclosporin. The single trial was small. It is not possible to be conclusive.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-19 17:51:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The data on the treatment of vasculitis remains incomplete. However this review summarises a significant body of research that represents some high quality data which clearly goes some way to giving guidance on treatment. The areas of the review with data from multiple studies are probably the most helpful and applicable. In these areas, the earlier studies carried multiple problems in disease ascertainment and methodology but there overall conclusions have generally been borne out by the later larger studies. This is reassuring on applicability. In some areas there are many further questions over how to deploy expensive and potentially harmful treatments. One example here is the data on the use of plasma exchange. This review suggests that it is a highly effective therapy when deployed in a particular group of patients, however this result rests on a relatively small number of outcomes. Questions remain as to whether it is a true effect and which patient groups will benefit. The majority of the data in this review is in patients with very poor kidney function. It may also work for patients with good kidney function. This hypothesis is still to be tested. For each of the areas of this review there are multiple such questions still to be answered.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-12 14:26:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The strength of this review rests on the breadth of the literature search which included non-English language studies. Unpublished individual patient data was obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Adu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adu 1997</LINK>. This is the first systematic review to cover all areas of renal vasculitis. The review is limited by the small number of available studies answering particular questions and some design features of the included studies. Several included diagnoses other than renal vasculitis. Some date prior to the development of the ANCA assay. This will limit the validity of the data and diagnoses included in those studies. Other differences include those between interventions, notably the regimens of immunosuppressive drugs and the number and volume of plasma exchanges utilised. Some of these may have had a very significant impact on the outcomes of studies and may explain the level of heterogeneity in some of the results. Studies of renal vasculitis are notoriously difficult to carry out due to the low incidence of the disease and consequent need for broad collaboration to attain patient numbers for adequately powered studies.</P>
<P>The earlier studies included in this review suffered from some significant methodological problems and inclusion of a wide range of diagnoses which may not have been well validated. The more recent data is of much higher quality, especially those studies run by the European Vasculitis Study group. These have generated a significant body of high quality data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-19 17:56:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Three previous reviews have covered some of the subjects addressed in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2007</LINK> provides a broad review of the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. This includes patients with localized disease and those without renal vasculitis. They include a large number of uncontrolled studies and there was no attempt at meta-analysis. In the area of severe vasculitis with kidney involvement, there is a brief summary of the RCT data as included in this review. Their conclusions are similar to ours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> is a review of the data relating to the use of pulse or continuous CPA for induction of remission of ANCA-associated vasculitis and includes a meta-analysis of the RCT data. As such, it performs a similar meta-analysis to ours in this area. There are, however, a number of differences. <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> has utilised all the data from <LINK REF="STD-Adu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adu 1997</LINK>. We have extracted the data only for patients without PAN and with some evidence of glomerular involvement. This accounts for some of the differences but not all. <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> reports that treatment failure is more likely with continuous treatment with CPA. This is based on 8/25 patients, in <LINK REF="STD-Adu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adu 1997</LINK>, failing treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Adu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adu 1997</LINK> reports 4/30 patients failed remission induction. Of those, 1/20 suffered treatment failure in the data we have extracted. <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> quotes 4/25 patients failing treatment on continuous treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Haubitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Haubitz 1998</LINK>. Our understanding of this paper suggests that of those four patients, three had in fact died, mostly of sepsis. This is not entirely clear from the paper and we have been so far unable to substantiate this further. Each of these changes contributes to the overall effect in <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> showing an increased risk of treatment failure on continuous treatment. Currently we do not believe that a close inspection of the data bears this out. The difference in figures here is also reflected in the results for relapse rate. Our results show that continuous treatment is significantly better at preventing relapse. We have studied relapse as related to the initial number of patients whereas <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> have recorded relapses as related to achieved remissions. With the higher treatment failure figures in the continuous arm, <LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 2001</LINK> does not show a significant difference in the overall relapse rate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2011</LINK> performed a similar systematic review to ours in the area of plasma exchange and its effect on ESKD, death and a combined endpoint of both. They demonstrated similar results to ours with a profound reduction on the development of ESKD and no effect on death. They then combined those two endpoints to argue that there was little conclusive evidence for the overall effect of plasma exchange on the "hard" endpoint of ESKD and death combined. It is currently our view that combining two outcomes with markedly different results does not serve to appropriately highlight the efficacy of plasma exchange. The current data suggests a striking reduction in the numbers of patients requiring RRT with no change in the risk of death.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-19 17:58:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-19 17:57:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Plasma exchange is effective in patients with severe AKI secondary to vasculitis. On current data, the use of pulse CPA results in an increased risk of relapse when compared to continuous use but a reduced total CPA dose. The use of co-trimoxazole is not supported for prevention of relapse of vasculitis. AZA and MTX are effective as maintenance therapy once remission has been achieved. MMF is equivalent to CPA as an induction agent. The use of MMF in remission maintenance should be third line after failure, or contraindication, of other agents such as AZA and MTX. Etanercept is not recommended for use in vasculitis. Leflunomide may be useful as maintenance therapy but requires further evaluation. IVIg is useful but only as a short-term measure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-19 17:58:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Further research is required to address the use of plasma exchange in patients with SCr &lt; 500 µM at presentation. This investigation is currently under way as part of <LINK REF="STD-PEXIVAS-Study-2011" TYPE="STUDY">PEXIVAS Study 2011</LINK> run by the European Vasculitis Study Group. A cost effectiveness analysis is also required for the use of plasma exchange when compared with methylprednisolone. Clearly there is a large difference between the two therapies in terms of cost, ease of use and complications of therapy. As the population of patients evolves over time and patients with milder disease are treated, it is highly likely that any cost effectiveness analysis would suggest that a minor benefit potentially conferred by plasma exchange would come at too great a cost when compared with IV methylprednisolone. The need for dialysis after remission induction treatment with CPA requires some clarification. Current studies suggest that pulse CPA may leave more patients on dialysis unnecessarily. A cost effectiveness analysis is also likely to be required for rituximab. Initial results suggest that there is no major benefit in terms of efficacy with rituximab compared with CPA. Cost savings may be evident in avoidance of adverse events but this requires further study.</P>
