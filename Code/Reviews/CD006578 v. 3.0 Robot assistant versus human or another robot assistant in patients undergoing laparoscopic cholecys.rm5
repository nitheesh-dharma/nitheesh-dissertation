<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-20 10:05:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Patients with symptomatic gallstones generally undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key-hole removal of the gallbladder). During this procedure there is only tunnel vision for the surgeon provided by a camera inserted through one of the key-holes. The surgeon operates using instruments while a nurse or another doctor shows the surgeon the operating field using the camera. Thus, the human assistant acts as the 'surgeons' eyes' during the laparoscopic procedure. Recently, robots have been used to assist the surgeons in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Various types of robots exist. Some just hold the camera and can be controlled by surgeons' voice commands or the surgeons' head movements. Adanced robotic systems can hold the camera and all the instruments, all of which are controlled by the surgeon using a console (like in a gaming device). The role of a robotic assistant in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known. We sought this information by undertaking a detailed literature search in a systematic way to obtain all the information available from randomised clinical trials. Such clinical trials, if designed well, provide the best estimate of the true effects of interventions.</P>
<P>A detailed and systematic review of the literature revealed that there were six randomised clinical trials including 560 patients. One trial involving 129 patients did not state the number of patients randomised to the two groups. Of the remaining 431 patients in the remaining five trials, 212 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the help of robot assistant and 219 patients underwent the same procedure with the help of a human assistant. All the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, they were prone to systematic underestimation of harms or overestimation of the benefits of the robotic assistant group or the human assistant group because of the beliefs of the people conducting the trial) and errors due to play of chance. Mortality and surgical complications were reported in only one trial with 40 patients. There were no mortality or surgical complications in either group in this trial. Mortality and morbidity were not reported in the remaining trials. Quality of life or the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-patient laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients were not reported in any trial. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy or in the operating time between the two groups. In one trial, about one sixth of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies in which a robot assistant was used required temporary use of a human assistant. In another trial, there was no requirement for human assistants. One trial did not report this information. It appears that there was little or no requirement for human assistants in the other three trials. Robot-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not seem to offer any significant advantages over human-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, our present evidence base is limited by trials that all have high risk of systematic errors (potential to underestimate harms or overestimate benefits of the robot assistant group or the human assistant group) and random errors (that is, play of chance). Therefore, further well-designed randomised trials with low risk of systematic errors and low risk of random errors are needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-20 10:03:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We included six trials with 560 patients. One trial involving 129 patients did not state the number of patients randomised to the two groups. In the remaining five trials 431 patients were randomised, 212 to the robot assistant group and 219 to the human assistant group. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Mortality and morbidity were reported in only one trial with 40 patients. There was no mortality or morbidity in either group. Mortality and morbidity were not reported in the remaining trials. Quality of life or the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-patient laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients were not reported in any trial. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (2 trials; 4/63 (weighted proportion 6.4%) in the robot assistant group versus 5/70 (7.1%) in the human assistant group; RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.25 to 3.20). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (4 trials; 324 patients; MD 5.00 minutes; 95% CI -0.55 to 10.54). In one trial, about one sixth of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies in which a robot assistant was used required temporary use of a human assistant. In another trial, there was no requirement for human assistants. One trial did not report this information.

<P>Robot assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not seem to offer any significant advantages over human assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, all trials had a high risk of systematic errors or bias (that is, risk of overestimation of benefit and underestimation of harm). All trials were small, with few or no outcomes. Hence, the risk of random errors (that is, play of chance) is high. Further randomised trials with low risk of bias or random errors are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-20 10:05:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00f8_rgensen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jørgensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muhrbeck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhrbeck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). More than half a million cholecystectomies (removal of the gallbladder) are performed per year in the United States alone (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>). Regional differences exist in the cholecystectomy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00e4_land-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjäland 1998</LINK>). Laparoscopic ('key-hole') cholecystectomy is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fullarton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fullarton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakken 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a camera inserted into the abdominal cavity acts as the surgeon's eyes and is controlled by a trained human assistant in conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In order to overcome the difficulty of the availability of trained assistants due to the laws limiting working hours (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2004</LINK>), and to overcome the problems of an unsteady camera (<LINK REF="STD-Aiono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aiono 2002</LINK>), robot-assisted camera control has been suggested as an alternative. There are different methods by which the camera can be controlled using a robot.<BR/>1. 'EndoAssist' is a freestanding laparoscopic camera manipulator controlled by infrared signals from a headset worn by the operator (<LINK REF="STD-Aiono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aiono 2002</LINK>).<BR/>2. 'Aesop' is a voice-controlled robot which responds to the surgeon's voice (<LINK REF="STD-Den-Boer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Den Boer 2002</LINK>).<BR/>3. 'Passist' is a manually controlled mechanical arm that is capable of locking the laparoscope and an additional grasper in the desired position, allowing for adjustments of position using one hand (<LINK REF="STD-Den-Boer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Den Boer 2002</LINK>).<BR/>4. The 'Zeus system' (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK>) and the 'Da Vinci system' (<LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk 2005</LINK>) are systems in which the surgeon controls the robotic arms using a console (tele-robotic surgery) (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Robot assistants can help in the workforce planning, avoiding the need for a trained assistant. They may also avoid surgeons' tremors, which can be magnified because of the use of long instruments with the abdominal wall acting as the fulcrum.</P>
<P>This review is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review about the role of a robot assistant in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>We followed the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2012</LINK>). According to empirical evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>), the risk of bias of the trials was assessed based on the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and vested interest bias. Risk of bias domains were classified as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation sequence generation </HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial is described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the sequence generation method is not, or may not be, random. Quasi&#8208;randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients, are inadequate and will be excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi&#8208;randomised. Quasi&#8208;randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there is insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used is likely to introduce bias in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessors</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there is insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used is likely to introduce bias in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the underlying reasons for missing data are unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods have been employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there is insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data are likely to introduce bias in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the crude estimate of effects (eg, complete case estimate) will clearly be biased due to the underlying reasons for missing data, and the methods used to handle missing data are unsatisfactory.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: pre&#8208;defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre&#8208;defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on, or are not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vested interest bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: if the trial is conducted by a party without any vested interests in the outcome of the trial.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: if it is not clear if the trial is conducted by a party with vested interest in the outcome of the trial.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: if the trial is conducted by a party with vested interests in the outcome of the trial (such as robotic assistant manufacturer).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We considered trials which were classified as low risk of bias in all the above domains as trials with low risk of bias. In all other cases, trials were classified as at high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We reported the risk difference if this was different from risk ratio (that is, if the risk difference was statistically significant and the risk ratio was not statistically significant, and vica versa). Risk difference includes the 'zero event trials' while the risk ratio does not. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. For serious adverse events we reported the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>We performed an intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>). If this was not possible, we imputed data for binary outcomes using various scenarios such as the best-worst case scenario, worst-best case scenario, best-best case scenario, and worst-worst case scenario (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we planned to use available-case analysis. For continuous outcomes, we imputed the standard deviations from P values according to the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and used the median for the meta-analysis when the mean was not available. If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from P values or confidence intervals, we planned to impute the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation noted for that group under that outcome.</P>
<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2012</LINK>) using the software package Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We use a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). In the case of discrepancy between the two models, we have reported both results; otherwise we have reported only the results from the fixed-effect model.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We explored heterogeneity by the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with significance set at a P value of 0.10, and measured the quantity of heterogeneity by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We intended to perform the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Trials with low risk of bias compared to trials with high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Different types of robot assistant (eg, tele-robotic, voice-controlled, head-controlled, manual control).</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, we performed none of these due to the fact that all trials had high risk of bias and none compared different robots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use a funnel plot to explore bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) and to use asymmetry in a funnel plot of trial size against treatment effect to assess this bias in the case where more than 10 trials were included. We also planned to perform the linear regression approach described by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK> to determine the funnel plot asymmetry. However, we performed neither of these because few trials were included under each outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of findings table</HEADING>
<P>Although we planned to report all the outcomes in the summary of findings table using GradePro 3.6 (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/other-resources/gradepro">http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/other-resources/gradepro</A>), we have reported only conversion to open cholecystectomy and operating time as these were the only outcomes that provided information for the summary of findings table.</P>

<P>We identified a total of 80 references through electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (n = 8), MEDLINE (n = 28), EMBASE (n = 11), and Science Citation Index Expanded<I> </I>(n = 33). We excluded 21 duplicates and 50 clearly irrelevant references through reading abstracts. Nine references were retrieved for further assessment. One reference was identified through scanning reference lists of the identified randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gracia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gracia 1996</LINK>). We excluded four references for the reasons listed in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>Six randomised trials involving 560 patients, randomised to robot assistants (212 patients) versus human assistants (219 patients), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reference identified by scanning the reference lists was a conference abstract of a trial involving 129 patients, but it did not provide the number of patients randomised to each group (<LINK REF="STD-Gracia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gracia 1996</LINK>). All six trials were completed trials and compared robot assistants versus human assistants. The flow of references is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Details about the types of devices used, sample size, patient characteristics, surgeons' previous experience with the robot assistant, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the trials are shown in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-20 10:08:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>This review has shown that robot-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not seem to offer any significant advantages over human-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The robot assistants assessed in this review were 'Endoassist' (<LINK REF="STD-Aiono-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aiono 2002</LINK>), 'Aesop' (<LINK REF="STD-Den-Boer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Den Boer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2004</LINK>), 'Passist' (<LINK REF="STD-Den-Boer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Den Boer 2002</LINK>), and 'Zeus' (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK>). There was no difference in the proportion of patients who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy or in the operating time. Not enough direct information on morbidity is available from the randomised clinical trials. Only one trial reported mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three observational studies were identified from the searches performed (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanoue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tanoue 2006</LINK>). These studies included 20 patients (10 underwent surgery using a robotic assistant and 10 underwent surgery with a human assistant) (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 2004</LINK>), 24 patients (12 underwent surgery by robot assistant and 12 underwent surgery by human assistant) (<LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk 2005</LINK>), and 51 patients (10 underwent surgery by robot assistant and 41 underwent surgery by human assistant) (<LINK REF="STD-Tanoue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tanoue 2006</LINK>). All three studies reported surgical morbidity. None of the morbidities were related to the robot in any of these observational studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanoue-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tanoue 2006</LINK>) and there was no difference in the overall surgical morbidities in the robot assistant group and human assistant group in the two observational studies that reported overall surgical morbidities (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review, we demonstrated that the errors were potentially fewer with the robot assistant compared with a human assistant (not statistically significant) (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). Given that laparoscopic cholecystectomy has a very low incidence of mortality, and the lack of difference in the error rate (such as gallbladder perforations) between the human assistant and robotic assistant (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>), 10s of 1000s of patients will be necessary to demonstrate any difference in mortality or morbidity between a human assistant and robot assistant. Taking all the information including indirect evidence into account, it appears that a robotic assistant is safe, although one cannot completely rule out the small possibility of increased morbidity with a robot assistant unless trials at low risk of bias and including 1000s of patients are performed.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it must be noted that the surgeons' experience in using the robotic assistant was much less than using the human assistant. The previous experience of the surgeons in the use of a robot assistant varied from no experience to good experience. The set-up time and total operation time decreases even after performing 32 robot-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomies (<A HREF="Vidovszky 2006">Vidovszky 2006</A>). The validity of a comparison between a procedure in which the surgeons were experienced and another in which the surgeons were not experienced is not clear. The previous experience of the surgeons in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and that of the human assistants in assisting laparoscopic procedures are other factors that could also influence the results. The validity of comparing two groups of which one group had far more experience in the use of the assistant can be questioned and one has to wonder whether this is due to the known or unknown prejudice of the trialists in favouring the human assistant over a robotic assistant or is simply because of poor trial design. In one of the trials, the surgeons were trainees and the assistants had experience of assisting at least 100 laparoscopic procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2004</LINK>). However, such experienced assistants are not available in all hospitals. Thus, the information provided in the trials included in this review is insufficient to arrive at an unbiased conclusion.</P>
<P>One of the important consequences of a robot assistant could be workforce planning. This could enable a surgeon to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy even in the absence of an experienced human assistant. One trial reported that around 18% of the patients in which robot assistants were used also required human assistance (although only temporarily in the majority of the patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2004</LINK>). Although the previous experience of the surgical trainees has not been quantified in this trial, this is an issue of considerable importance for people who plan to substitute or supplement the human workforce with a robotic workforce. If human assistants must be available during the use of a robot assistant, there would be major cost and training implications. In another trial, there was no requirement for human assistants in the robotic assistant group (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>). We were not able to infer the proportion of robot-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomies that required human assistants in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gracia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gracia 1996</LINK>). In the other three trials, it appears that there was no need for human assistance other than the occasional help of the nurse in positioning the robot in the robot-assisted group. It must also be noted that all the trials included only elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is a more complex procedure, with a higher proportion of patients who develop complications and undergo conversion to open cholecystectomy, than elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic (<LINK REF="REF-Rutledge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutledge 2000</LINK>). Trials are necessary to assess the value of robot-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.</P>
<P>It appears that robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not offer any benefit over human assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A formal cost-effectiveness analysis should be performed to assess whether robot assistants can supplement or replace human assistants in different settings such as previous availability of a robot for use in other operations, a human assistant available in case of necessity, and the use of a robot assistant in the setting of service provision where surgical training is not the main focus.</P>
