<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:51:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypoalbuminaemia (low blood albumin levels), oedema (a build-up of fluid, resulting in swelling) and hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol) are the major characteristics of nephrotic syndrome. At present, the primary drugs for nephrotic syndrome are corticosteroids, alkylating agents and cyclosporin. However there are many adverse effects associated with their use. This review identified nine studies (461 participants) comparing Huangqi type formulations with control drugs. The results of this review suggest that Huangqi type formulations may have a positive effect on nephrotic syndrome by increasing plasma albumin and reducing urine albumin excretion, blood cholesterol and triglycerides. Huangqi type formulation may reduce some adverse effects of other drugs used for treating nephrotic syndrome, however these were only reported in two studies. The methodological quality of the nine included studies was poor and was the major limitation of this review. The types of pathology, sex and age of the patients, as well as the duration and dosage of the Huangqi type formulations could not be analysed.</P>

<P>Patients with primary nephrotic syndrome mostly need immunosuppression to achieve remission, but many of them either relapse after immunosuppression therapy or resistant to it. On the other hand, immunosuppression therapy could increase the adverse effect. Huangqi and Huangqi type formulations have been used to treat nephrotic syndrome for years in China, however the effects and safety of these formulations have not been systematically reviewed. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-08 15:19:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine studies were identified. One was judged to be at high risk of bias for random sequence, the rest were judged to be at low risk of bias. All studies had high risk of bias for allocation concealment and performance bias; unclear risk for detection bias and low risk for attrition bias. Two studies had unclear risk reporting bias and the rest had low risk. No other potential threats to validity were found. Compared to control interventions, Huangqi type formulations had a positive effect on plasma albumin (MD 6.41 g/dL, 95% Cl 4.24 to 8.59), urine albumin excretion (-0.57 g/24 h, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.10), cholesterol (MD -1.70 mmol/L, 95% Cl -2.60 to -1.13) and triglycerides (-0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.03); and more patients showed improvement at three months (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84). There was no significant difference between Huangqi type formulations and control interventions for complete (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 8.65) or partial remission (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.58). While some formulations showed improvement in the number of patients achieving complete or partial remission, the number of studies (usually one per formulation), and the number patients (ranging from 38 to 78) were small. Relapse was reported at varying time points, ranging from three months to three years, and therefore these results were not pooled. Complications of nephrotic syndrome and adverse events were only reported by two studies; Only one study reported complications of nephrotic syndrome (infection) and another reported adverse reactions to treatment (Cushing's syndrome, steroid withdrawal syndrome, respiratory tract infection, and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Both studies reported those treated with Huangqi type formulations had significantly less complications or adverse reactions. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-08 18:14:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that is often caused by any disease that damages the kidneys. Heavy proteinuria (&gt; 3.5 g/d), hypoalbuminaemia (serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL), oedema and hypercholesterolaemia are the main characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UMMC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UMMC 2009</LINK>). It can be divided into two types - primary and secondary nephrotic syndrome. Primary nephrotic syndrome may occur in association with a diverse array of glomerular disorders including;<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>minimal change disease (MCD) responsible for about 80% of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 20% in adults,</LI>
<LI>focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) responsible for about 8% of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 15% in adults,</LI>
<LI>membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) responsible for about 1% of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 25% in adults,</LI>
<LI>membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) responsible for about 5% of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 12% in adults (<LINK REF="REF-UMMC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UMMC 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ye-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Normally, proteins are restricted by a charge-selective barrier and a size-selective barrier (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2012</LINK>). But in nephrotic syndrome, the barriers are damaged, which let proteins leak into the urine (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2011</LINK>). As a result, plasma protein and colloid osmotic pressure (COP) decrease, which result in the shift of fluid from the blood vessels into the body tissues causing oedema. Sodium retention causes a greater shift in fluid and thus an increase in oedema and occurs in some patients with nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Koomans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koomans 2003</LINK>). Hypoalbuminaemia is caused not only by urinary loss of albumin but also results from increased catabolism, decreased synthesis, and increased gastrointestinal loss (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2011</LINK>). Hypercholesterolaemia (high levels of cholesterol, VLDL, IDL, LDL, lipoprotein (a) (Lp (a)) and triglyceride) is thought to be the consequence of both increased synthesis and decreased catabolism of lipoprotein. Abnormal function of enzymes or regulatory proteins such as lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, lipoprotein lipase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein also contribute to the hypercholesterolaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Doucet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doucet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saland 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Immunosuppression therapy is the most important treatment for the primary nephrotic syndrome. However, many patients may relapse or resistant after the therapy. For example, while up to 90% of adults with MCD will respond to initial therapy with prednisone, approximately one-third of these same patients will relapse within 6 months and require further immunosuppression(<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waldman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waldman 2007</LINK>).With diseases such as idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and FSGS, for which first-line therapies produce substantially lower response rates than for MCD, physicians are often compelled to use second-, third-, and even fourth-line therapies to achieve remission(<LINK REF="REF-Cattran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattran 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cattran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattran 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segarra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segarra 2009</LINK>).There is no standard therapy for patients with frequent relapsing, steroid-dependent or resistant nephrotic syndrome. Prolonged or repeated steroid therapy can lead to a variety of serious side effects. Achieving remission is an important goal that predicts an excellent long-term prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2009</LINK>). Antibiotics may be needed to control infections. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretic medications and a low-protein diet are also used to treat nephrotic syndrome. Treatment depends on the underlying disorder which has caused nephrotic syndrome. Though many of these drugs are effective on the treatment of primary nephrotic syndrome, they also cause many adverse effects including infection, osteoporosis, suppression of bone marrow and liver damage. All in all, the lack of efficacy and safety of existing treatment protocols make the treatment of nephrotic syndrome difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Meyrier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyrier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ye-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001a</LINK>). Most of the physicians consider them could increase the remission rate and reduce the adverse effect. Huangqi and Huangqi type formulations have been used to treat nephrotic syndrome for years in China, such as Huangqi intravenous injection, Huangqi oral solution, Yiqibushen soup, Shenkanglin doction and Huangqi-Danggui mixture. Huangqi with Danggui mixture could increase the synthesis of liver protein on the mRNA level, and decrease the blood lipid level (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2003</LINK>). Huangqi, Taizishen and Shanyao have an effect on strengthening spleen, supplementing qi, inducing diuresis for removing oedema (<LINK REF="STD-Lan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lan 2005</LINK>). Huangqi could improve anaemia, and also the status of water-sodium retention (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2001a</LINK>). Huangqi is a one of the traditional Chinese herbal medicines. It is the dried root of Huangqi membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. Var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao or Huangqi membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. Or Hedysarum polybotrys Hand.-Mazz (fam. Leguminosae) (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998</LINK>). Huangqi contains many active components, including calycosin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside, formononetin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside, (6 alpha R, 11 alpha R) 3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, 7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, calycosin and formononetin (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2005</LINK>). Studies in patients and experimental animals suggest that Huangqi reduces proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, hyperlipidaemia and acts as a diuretic (<LINK REF="REF-Peng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2005</LINK>). Huangqi may reduce proteinuria by:<BR/>

<P>As a result, degradation of VLDL and reverse transportation of cholesterol are accelerated, which is beneficial to the decrease of serum VLDL. These effects are favourable for preventing further kidney injury caused by hyperlipidaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2000</LINK>).

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (mortality, relapse, complications, adverse effects, no improvement at three months, the duration of remission, the number and proportion of patients developing hypertension, CKD or ESKD), results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RR and 95% CI within individual studies were calculated from the number of events and numbers of participants at risk extracted from each included study.

<P>Heterogeneity was analysed, where applicable, using a chi-squared test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I² values of 25%, 50% and 75% corresponded to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis was done, and there was no statistical significance between the fixed-effects and random-effects model in the data synthesis. So the random-effect model in the studies was used in the study. Data for each study were analysed and expressed as RRs and mean difference. Subgroup analysis was planned to explore the heterogeneity in different interventions. We used a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled effect size of these studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:35:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Based on nine studies enrolling 461 participants conducted in China, Huangqi type formulations may have a beneficial effect on increasing plasma albumin, and reducing urine albumin excretion, triglycerides and cholesterol, and increasing the number reporting improvement in clinical and physical symptoms at three months. Huangqi type formulations may also reduce the number to days to oedema remission, number of infections and the adverse reactions of other drugs. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate if Huangqi type formulations improve complete or partial remission, or reduce or delay the number of patients who relapse. No adverse events of Huangqi type formulation were reported. However, studies of Huangqi type formulations for nephrotic syndrome lacked sufficient power to provide reliable estimates of their effectiveness and adverse effects, due to poor study design and methodological quality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:42:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We were unable to determine the benefits and harms of Huangqi and Huangqi type formulations in treating nephrotic syndrome in any age group, either as sole agents or in addition to other drug therapies. All nine studies were conducted in China. Eight studies involved patients with all types of nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>) and did not mention the histological subtype of nephrotic syndrome; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK> only involved patients with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis type nephrotic syndrome. Different histological subtype of primary nephrotic syndrome may lead to different responds to the same therapy. We could not perform any subgroup analyses to investigate this based on the limited data.</P>
<P>Three studies included both adults and children but none reported the number of adults or children (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>). Five studies only included children (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK> included only adults. Children are more likely to respond to therapy than adults, even when adults have minimal change disease, and this may have had an influence on the results. Again, we could not do subgroup analysis because of limited data.</P>
<P>Patient diagnoses also varied. Five studies included nephrotic syndrome patients who had not been previously treated (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>), and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>) only included relapsing nephrotic syndrome patients. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>) enrolled both patients presenting for the first time with nephrotic syndrome and those with relapsing nephrotic syndrome, however data were not presented separately. The therapeutic effect may be totally different between these two groups although they received the same therapy, so this may influence the results.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>) used Huangqi as the intervention, and five studies used Huangqi type formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>). Complete remission (three studies), partial remission (two studies), urine albumin excretion (three studies), plasma albumin (five studies), triglycerides (four studies), cholesterol (four studies), time to oedema remission (one study), no improvement at three months (three studies), relapse (four studies), complications (one study) and adverse reactions (1 study) were reported. Mortality, number and proportion of patients developing hypertension, CKD or ESKD, the duration of remission, TCM outcome and cost were not reported. The timing of outcome measurements were not clearly reported in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>). Three studies reported when the outcomes were assessed, however each study measured these at different time points. <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK> evaluated the effects of therapy after one month treatment; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK> measured the immune index after six weeks treatment and evaluated relapse after three years; and <LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK> assessed the outcomes after three months of treatment. None of the studies reported who measured these outcomes.</P>
<P>The standard first line medication for nephrotic syndrome is prednisolone or prednisone. However, many patients may relapse or are resistant to therapy. While Chinese herbal medicine is not widely used in treating nephrotic syndrome patients outside China, many hospitals in China use immunosuppression combined with Chinese herbal medicine, such as Huangqi to treat nephrotic syndrome with the aim of increasing the efficacy and safety of the immunosuppression therapy. In our review, Huangqi type formulations may have some positive effects in treating nephrotic syndrome by increasing plasma albumin and reducing urine albumin excretion, blood cholesterol and triglycerides. It may also decrease the number of days to oedema remission, the number of patients who relapse, the number of patients with no improvement at three months, infection and adverse events. There were no significant differences between Huangqi type formulations and control drugs on complete or partial remission.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was poorly reported. One study described the use of a random number table to create the random sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>); one stated they used simple randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>); and seven studies did not describe random sequence generation. We telephoned the authors of these seven studies and established that they were all RCTs. Overall, six studies used a random number table (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>), one used computer software (<LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>), one used minimised imbalance index distribution (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK>) and one used simple randomisation (drawing lots) (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>). Allocation concealment and blinding were also not mentioned in any of the included studies. By telephoning the authors, we were able to confirm that no study used allocation concealment; single blinding was used in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 2004</LINK>) and no blinding was used in the other seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2002</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>). These three characteristics may lead to selection, performance and detection bias and may result in false positive findings. All nine studies reported the outcome data of the included participants, and the risk of attrition bias was assessed to be low. <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK> did not report all the pre-defined outcomes, such as complete blood count, routine urine examination and kidney function. This may lead to both selection and reporting bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-08 17:03:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This systematic review involved a comprehensive search strategy and only included RCTs. We searched English and Chinese language databases to identify all possible RCTs. We acknowledge that there may be studies of Huangqi type formulation published in other languages, however by searching CENTRAL (which contains over 500,000 reports of studies from indexed, non-indexed and handsearched journals and conference proceedings in many languages) we do not believe we have missed any major study. Data extraction, analysis and methodological quality assessments were performed by two or more authors. We found a large number of clinical trials investigating Huangqi type formulation for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome. We contacted authors to clarify how the study was conducted; this resulted in the exclusion of 363 reports. Most investigators misunderstood true random allocation resulting in poor methodological quality and ineligible study design.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-08 17:04:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two systematic reviews investigating Huangqi or Huangqi type formulation for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome have been previously published (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2006f" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006f</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2009d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2009d</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Li-2006f" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006f</LINK> included four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999c" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>) and concluded Buyanghuanwu soup (Huangqi, Guiwei, Chishao, Dilong, Chuanqiong, Taoren, Honghua) improved the effective rate and safety of primary nephrotic syndrome. In our review we excluded these four studies. On phoning the authors we determined that these four studies were not randomised. <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2009d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2009d</LINK> included 20 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Deng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2007g" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2007g</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ning-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ning 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002f" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002f</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001c" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001c</LINK>). This review concluded that <I>Radix astragali</I> could increase the therapeutic effect of prednisone and immunosuppression for primary nephrotic syndrome and reduce its recurrence. <I>Radix Astragali</I> also increased plasma albumin and decreased 24 hour proteinuria and plasma cholesterol. Again on phoning the authors of these 20 studies we excluded 19 for the same reasons as for <LINK REF="REF-Li-2006f" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006f</LINK> - the studies were not randomised. The reason for this obvious difference in study selection might be that these two review authors did not telephone the study authors to confirm study design, and in particular random sequence generation. Five studies in our review enrolled children (<LINK REF="STD-Ai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK>), however only one of the four studies published before the completion of <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2009d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2009d</LINK> was included (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006a</LINK>). We performed a comprehensive search using a well-defined search strategy and contacted all authors of potentially eligible studies.<BR/>

<P>Huangqi and Huangqi type formulations may have a positive effect on nephrotic syndrome. However, limited by the small number of poorly-designed RCTs enrolling small number of participants, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of Huangqi type formulations for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome.</P>

<P>When considering the risk of bias from lack of blinding it is important to consider specifically:</P>
<OL>
<LI>who was and was not blinded</LI>
<LI>risk of bias in actual outcomes due to lack of blinding during the study (e.g. due to co-intervention or differential behaviour)</LI>
<LI>risk of bias in outcome assessments (considering how subjective or objective an outcome is).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>High risk: A difference in the proportion of incomplete outcome data across groups is of concern if the availability of outcome data is determined by the participants&#8217; true outcomes. For example, if participants with poorer clinical outcomes are more likely to drop out due to adverse effects, and this happens mainly in the experimental group, then the effect estimate will be biased in favour of the experimental intervention.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: The numbers randomised into each intervention group are not clearly reported.</LI>
<LI>Low risk: To conclude that there are no missing outcome data, review authors should be confident that the participants included in the analysis are exactly those who were randomised into the trial. Participants randomised but subsequently found not to be eligible need not always be considered as having missing outcome data.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk: Pre-defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk: Not all pre-defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported, or they were not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded.</LI>
<LI>High risk: One or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes was not reported, and the data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>

<LI>Design-specific risks of bias</LI>
<LI>Early stopping</LI>
<LI>Baseline imbalance</LI>
<LI>Blocked randomisation in unblinded trials</LI>
<LI>Differential diagnostic activity</LI>
<LI>others: The conduct of the study is affected by interim results. There is deviation from the study protocol in a way that does not reflect clinical practice. There is pre-randomization administration of an intervention that could enhance or diminish the effect of a subsequent, randomised, intervention. Inappropriate administration of an intervention. Occurrence of &#8216;null bias&#8217; due to interventions being insufficiently well delivered or overly wide inclusion criteria for participants. An insensitive instrument is used to measure outcomes. Inappropriate influence of funders.</LI>
