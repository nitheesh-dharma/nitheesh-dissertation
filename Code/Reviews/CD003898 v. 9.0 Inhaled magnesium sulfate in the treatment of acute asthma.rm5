My responses in bold alongside your comments. Have accepted tracked changes throughout review as I went through it. Happy to discuss anything further. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between protocol and review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is it fair to say that the background, results and discussion has been largely redrafted? &lt;b&gt;- yes, have added. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added a SOF table &lt;b&gt;- thanks &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of interventions - I bulleted the list to make it easier - but the order should reflect that of the comparisons elsewhere in the review &lt;b&gt;- thanks, I've re-ordered&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;spot check ROB paragraphs &lt;b&gt;- thanks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;check my edits and check units where highlighted &lt;b&gt;- thanks, done &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;state if the funding source for the trial was not stated/available &lt;b&gt;- thanks, done. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of excluded studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;some studies from last version of the review were excluded, but perhaps should have been waiting classification? e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Abd 1997&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Abd 1997&lt;/a&gt;a&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Bustamante 2000&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Bustamante 2000&lt;/a&gt;a&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;- agreed. Have moved those two to awaiting classification, although there wasn't much I could put in tables as I couldn't even find abstracts for them online. All the other exclusions looked ok to me. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;comparison 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't see the place of &amp;quot;any dyspnoea&amp;quot; (analysis 1.3) in lung function - perhaps this could be included as a secondary outcome under symptoms if it is really felt to add something&lt;b&gt; - I agree, was there from previous version. Don't think it adds anything and isn't pre-specified. Have deleted. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subgroup analysis 1.8. Can you really say that moderate-severe are less likely to be admitted based on this subgroup analysis? Are the participants 'moderate to severe' or are they moderate or severe?If so, is the result due to the moderate or the severe patients? Could it be any other aspect of the 2 studies causing the difference rather than the severity? &lt;b&gt;- RN - on further consideration, I've deleted this subgroup. It's impossible to draw any conclusion for the reasons you've given and it's very questionable whether we should perform SGA with only 2 trials in the MA, especially when one of them is so small. Similarly, I've deleted outcome 1.13 which was also a subgroup analysis involving only 2 studies. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Goodacre 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goodacre 2013&lt;/a&gt; reported a significantly higher (therefore better) diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving placebo and &amp;#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-agonist and ipratropium compared to MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-agonist and ipratropium at 60 minutes - is that right? The graph is showing the opposite so the axes labels may need to change? &lt;b&gt;- graph looks right to me (diamond goes to right, higher BP, favouring placebo?) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;comparison 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a few cases where you say that there was a problem meaning you couldn't include the analysis, but then it is included in the text. I always struggle when I see a lot of this in a review - and wonder if not including it in a forest plot downplays it in the reader's mind or not - if you couldn't decide what it meant such that it could go in the forest plot, why include it at all? &lt;b&gt;- I've had a look through, considering this point. I know what you mean, but I think in many cases it's because of an incompatible time point/outcome, rather than a 'problem' with one outcome per se... but happy to discuss further if you've got specific examples where you'd like to see a change. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is the 'dischargable' data useful? or could it be deleted? &lt;b&gt; - agreed, not very meaningful, removed it &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vital signs, heart rate. &lt;a link_type=&quot;ANALYSIS&quot; href=&quot;002.05&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analysis 2.5&lt;/a&gt; - the I2 is 82% and the pooling looks meaningless. The heart rate is much lower for the salbutamol alone group - does this mean that the MgSO4 was rasing the heart rate in the other group? The analysis result is dominated by the Aggarwal study which drops an average 2 bpm reduction in heart rate - is this clinically relevant? Bawady looks like a very favourable average reduction but not experienced by all patients. &lt;b&gt; - good point. I've switched off the totals due to the high levels of heterogeneity and just described findings for the three trials. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;comparison 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how are people to interpret the following outcome: &amp;quot;Ratio of increase in PEFR (%)&amp;quot;? -&lt;b&gt; it's a quote from the report, but on further examination of the relevant table, it looks like a mean difference between change scores, so I've removed the rather confusing quote. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what is the MCID for the Fischli index score? &lt;b&gt;- I haven't been able to find an MCID, but scores over 4 indicates acute severe asthma, so I've added this and a bit more info about the index for context.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary of findings tables - stick to the a priori chosen outcomes. Choose one of the lung function measures &lt;b&gt;- we said we'd include lung function (but didn't specify which and they're co-primary outcomes), hospital admission, severity scores and adverse events - there isn't anything else in the tables as far as I can see. I'm a bit reluctant to arbitrarily get rid of PEFR or FEV1 as I'm not sure I can make an unbiased choice having seen the data. Happy to be guided by editors. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check changes to headings and amend as necessary &lt;b&gt;- thanks, done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've tried to tidy up table 2 to remove redundancy and extraneous words. This needs careful checking. &lt;b&gt;- thanks. Agreed with all your changes and checked the total n column. Only thing I didn't agree with was the 'none' for pharamacological exclusions, as studies just didn't mention it, rather than confirming there were none. I've changed it to 'none stated'. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a duplicate of table 2 (see table 6) and split into the 3 comparisons. I think this is better - how about you? -&lt;b&gt; I've finished the job and split the other table. Took ages as had to go back to most of the original studies in the review - groan. But I agree it's better now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happy to split the other tables into the separate comparisons once you have checked the editing &lt;b&gt;- I've done it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments on Data checking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30 November 2016: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If we want to look at adults and children in the same Forest plot, then we should be using % predicted FEV1 and PEF as the outcome measure! On this basis please consider removal of outcomes 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.8!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC checked through &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Sarhan 2016&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sarhan 2016&lt;/a&gt; to verify data entry and all looks fine. &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Powell 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Powell 2013&lt;/a&gt;l states that 7 children had more than one adverse event, so please can Colin verify the number of children with an adverse event for outcome 3.13 and 3.17? I think that there may currently be double counting. &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Goodacre 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goodacre 2013&lt;/a&gt; data all looks to match the paper. There are a large number of outcomes and I wonder if we could group these in a more logical way? &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Hossein 2016&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Hossein 2016&lt;/a&gt; has mean and SD reversed in some tables but I agree with the data that has been entered. Do we need the 20 minute results as well as 60 minutes (I would vote for closest to 60 minutes throughout and remove 20 minute data)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Gaur 2008&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Gaur 2008&lt;/a&gt; has very small SD for FEV1 but matches the p value in the abstract? How do we deal with these small SD studies????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Alansari 2015&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Alansari 2015&lt;/a&gt; belongs in Comparison 1, as the randomised comparison was SABA with or without magnesium in the nebuliser for one hour (following combination treatment in both groups). These were also children who had been admitted to hospital, so maybe should not be in the Forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not clear what &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Ahmed 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Ahmed 2013&lt;/a&gt; means by % increase in PEF and do not think this should be included!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methods say that there will be subgrouping by adults and children where possible, so I think this should be the primary analysis. The combination of FEV1 and PEF between adults and children as MD does not make sense unless the scale is % predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main focus of this update should be the three new large studies &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Alansari 2015&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Alansari 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Goodacre 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goodacre 2013&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Powell 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Powell 2013&lt;/a&gt;, which are all saying that nebulised magnesium does not confer large benefits. This is in contrast to some of the smaller studies such as &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Badawy 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Badawy 2014&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Gaur 2008&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Gaur 2008&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Mohammedzadeh 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Mohammedzadeh 2014&lt;/a&gt; and I notice that the first two of these studies have unexplained small SDs associated with their results. What is our threshold for asking the authors for raw data (small SDs, very large effects, equal numbers in each group with no mention of blocking???) &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Mohammedzadeh 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Mohammedzadeh 2014&lt;/a&gt; may have very high correlation within participants for the change in % predicted PEF perhaps. &lt;b&gt;I would personally be very interested in having a look at the raw data on lung function and subsequent admissions from the&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Badawy 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Badawy 2014&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;authors if they can send it to us, but would not hold up the review whilst awaiting this.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that in terms of clinical application, we need to know about the effects of treatment reasonably soon after it is completed, as decisions about admission of use of other treatment is going to be made reasonably quickly (I think). However it is not always clear when the measurement is taken in respect to the last treatment given...&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Hughes 2003&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Hughes 2003&lt;/a&gt; reports 90 minute data, but this is actually 30 minutes after the treatment finished. &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Goodacre 2013&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Goodacre 2013&lt;/a&gt; treated 3 times at 20 minute intervals and then measured at one hour (end of treatment) and two hours. &lt;b&gt;Closest to 60 mins would be a pragmatic (but post hoc) time to make the primary analysis I think&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also suggest current comparison 3 becomes comparison 1 and maybe comparison 2 can be archived for this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have some small studies, that are generally at unclear risk of selection bias, which indicate benefit of Magnesium and two large high quality studies that rule out any large benefit. To me this is the bottom line of the update. In this circumstance the average of both types may be less useful than just stating the above?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;----------------------&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments on previous versions of review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 30th August. SoF table needs tidy up (units, comments etc.) and discussion about GRADE for single studies or results that were not combined. In my view these are too generous in their current GRADE assessments. Also Assumed risk cells are empty in the first table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Abreu-Gonzalez 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Abreu-Gonzalez 2002&lt;/a&gt; reports giving salbutamol 400mcg which is too low a dose for nebuliser so much have been given by MDI. I agree that this cannot be combined with the other studies, even if the &amp;quot;nebulised physiological saline&amp;quot; turns out to be saline! I have also removed the suggestion of earlier improvement in this study as this may well be post-hoc choice of significant differences?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have revised the abstract results and conclusions. Perhaps the authors can have a look at the changes to check they are happy with them and then we can discuss what to do with SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC editing 25th June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good to see lots of new data for this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reporting of results in this review is currently inconsistent (see yellow highlights). There is not a significant test for sub-group differences between severe and moderate asthma attacks, so the finding of benefit in the severe subgroup needs to be toned down a bit in light of this. Moreover the benefit on the SMD in lung function is not statistically significant, but described as a benefit of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is also reduced confidence in pooled results for outcomes where many studies contribute no data (what proportion of the randomised patients contribute to the SMD shown in the first outcome). Again this is not clearly mentioned as a possible problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question, as highlighted in the discussion is about the addition of Mg++ to standard best treatment, and at present it is not very easy to pick out these data from the review comparisons. Not sure if Mg++ in addition to beta-ags and ipratropium should be comparison 1, in addition to beta-ags comparison two and in comparison to other Rx relegated to comparison three etc. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the sentence in yellow in the discussion still correct. Some of the new trials seem to me to address the question that is being asked for, so I wondered if this is carried over from the old review (and is now redundant) or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good SoF table, thanks. None of the results is statistically significant. Was this considered for downgrading in the GRADE assessments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 3/05/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Steve and Kerry for this review update. It looks good. I have some queries which shouldn't be too difficult for you to address and then it will be ready to pass onto another editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you know, I thought the review would benefit from tightening up the nomenclature of the comparisons. After your agreeing, I went ahead and tidied up the headings. I have made some changes using tracked changes, although there are also some comments and questions in the text. What I suggest is that you read through my changes and accept what you are happy with. There are also some highlighted areas which need some additional information especially in the tables. Once you have attended to those things, have a look at my comments below. I did do quite a bit of copy editing as well, but I didn't leave all the tracked changes in for clarity. I mainly focused on style and clarity rather than getting into the nitty gritty of the review at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Objectives - need to match the objectives in the review exactly Emma we are a little unsure on this - we think the objectives feel OK. What did you have in mind?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selcetion criteria - need to include the types of participants Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main results -&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;please add a brief sentence on the comparability of the studies. You comment on adults v children, but could be worth adding about the heterogeneity of study interventions, time points measured perhaps? Happy to go with what the clinician thinks people will want to know about...Hope this should now be OK - come back to us if not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add a brief sentence on overall risk of bias/quality of evidence Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is it worth adding some information in the abstract about the secondary outcomes? This may be the only part of the review that people read so do make sure to include any outcomes that will be important to people making decisions about treatmentsEmma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please add in any adverse events Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, but I don't understand the specific objective. The specific objective appears to contain many comparisons and these don't appear to be indicated in the interventions, so I wonder if it could be tightened up a bit.Hope this should now be OK - please come back to us if not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;included studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;paragraph highlighted seems to belong in the results - if you agree, could you move it there?Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were many headings throughout the results section and so I tried to rationalise them a little and hope this helps?? I also merged some sentences into paragraphs as I think this will help the reader when it's viewed outside of RevMan.Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add the number of participants contributing data to each outcome? you will see a few xxx peppered throughout the results section - these require the number of participants, but probably not an exhaustive list of where they are needed...Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you state that you pooled using fixed effects, then start to see that you have reported both fixed and random and show random in forest plots. need to make a choice and be consistent. on refection, I think this was actually only in the first comparison, so not too much to do here - hurrah! [Note from SM and KD to Emma: ' this was like this in the original review and methods state if there is substantial heterogeneity RE will be used'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is unclear why you subgrouped lung function for FEV and PEF differently in comparisons 1. Can you either explain why or make it more consistent? Might be that this is left over from the old review and you think it will take too much time compared to the benefit, in which case leave it out (Steve we have discussed this type of thing many times and I think you will make the right choice and happy to go with that) [Note from SM and KD to Emma: 'subgroups weren&amp;#8217;t done here because of the number of studies reporting REF and FEV1 and adults and children. ]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Meral 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Meral 1996&lt;/a&gt; also shows a significant advantage for &amp;#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-agonist alone and reports the mean ratio of PEFR increase at 5th min and max response in 1st hour and 6th hour (SMD -0.91; 95% CI:-1.57 to -0.26).&amp;quot; what is the relevance of reporting the ratios? too much unnecessary info? Can this be deleted? Fine if there is some clinical relevance I don't understand of course! [Now should be OK ]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this mean: Three studies did not appear to measure or report this outcome but collect data which could contribute to a score although none are specifically mentioned?? implies that you were expecting to see data and hinting at reporting bias, but I'm not sure you meant to?Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;data and analyses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mild-moderate adverse events. Does this mean adverse events (rather than SAEs)? My feeling would be to add SAEs as an outcome and record this in changes to protocol Emma we have had to think about this one - by time you see this it should be OK but please come back to me if you feel it needs more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no need to use SMD if the results are pooled on the same scale e.g. analysis 2.1 should be MD I think?Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comparison &lt;/b&gt;2 - are side effects supposed to be called adverse events? If so, could you re-name to adverse events?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;References - &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Powell 2012&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Powell 2012&lt;/a&gt; needs a ref to the published work if it's been published Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need a note in the what's new event - I made a start, but do feel free to add to it!! Emma this should now be OK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;25 August CJC Edit.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for incorporating the revised Data from the Hughes study. The data in RevMan analyses cross-checks with the word document.&lt;br&gt;T-testing does not show a significant difference between mild and severe asthma in terms of Lung function so abstract amended accordingly.&lt;br&gt;See changes in red in abstract and results section. What's new has also be amended slightly.&lt;br&gt;Toby this can now be submitted as an update.&lt;br&gt;============================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC revision 21 May:&lt;br&gt;Totals switched off for single study in second comparison.&lt;br&gt;SMD throughout is fine. Text amended to reflect this. Fixed model throughout is consistent. I am a bit uneasy about changing this all to fixed post hoc, but there we go.&lt;br&gt;Current version is now up to date I think as long as Hughes results are confirmed.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;PS final version sorted on 22 May with SMD for Mangat put right and UCI for admissions corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;=====================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Edit by CJC post comment from Gustavo 20 May 2005&lt;br&gt;Bessmertny changed to 63 (21.9) for treatment and 68(21.9) for control. Also Hughes changed to 1.86(0.44) treatment and 1.42(0.47) for control. Please verify that these are now correct. Bessmertny matches the published CI so I am happy with this one!&lt;br&gt;I have checked the SMD between subgroup t-test for the first comparison and it is 0.69 (95% CI 0.13 to 1.25) when tested for severity.&lt;br&gt;I have worked from the text of the existing review as I am not happy combining all five studies (you may decide differently for Chest).&lt;br&gt;The text has been altered to incorporate the revised findings. See what you think. Word fie of revised text attached.&lt;br&gt;Sentence added in the What's new section.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 May 2005: Two errors in the first version of this review have been identified following a helpful comment from Dr G Rodrigo. These have now been corrected and as a result there is now a significant difference between subgroups of trials with severe, as opposed to mild, asthma exacerbations. Also the confidence interval of the pooled pulmonary function outcome is wider when a random effects model is employed.&lt;br&gt;15 Aug 2005: Further comments for Dr G Rodrigo prompted the reviewers to contact the authors to obtain the original data from the Huges 2003 study to obtain verified values for the mean and SD of FEV-1 at 60 min. This version of the review incorporates values provided by Dr R Beasley. The severe subgroup still shows a significant difference in pooled lung function when inhaled magnesium is added to beta2-agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;16 Feb Changes approved by Brian and sent off last week for Peer Review.&lt;br&gt;================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 8 Feb 2005&lt;br&gt;Dear Sandra and Brian,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for amending this review as suggested. I will send it out for peer review.&lt;br&gt;I have reworded the reporting of subgroups in the abstract. The key issue is that when compared with each other there is no significant difference between adults and children or between severe and mild exacerbations in terms of lung function. This should not be reported according to p value for each subgroup compared to the null (see Altman DG, Bland JM. Statistics Notes: Interaction revisited: the difference between two estimates. BMJ 2003;326(7382):219). This has been made clearer by turning on totals for lung function and looking at the Chi-square totals for the whole group minus the sub-group Chi square results. These are reported in the main results section. [Changes in red.]&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;==============================================================================================&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;br&gt;SORRY for the delays!

We have attached a revised version of the Inhaled MgSO4 review taking your feedback from march 19th into account. Please see below for our response to your specific suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Table of included studies: very thorough but spell check was worth running on the table.&lt;br&gt;[Au]A spell check on the entire document has been performed. I hope we have the blasted Americanization outta there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Metaview Labels: We no longer enter the data as negative lung function unless it has got worse. These need to be made positive and the graph labels reversed to reflect that treatment is better to the right.&lt;br&gt;[Au]The metaview graphs have been reformatted as described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Are any of these &amp;quot;change-from-baseline&amp;quot; scores - if so SMD is not suitable. [Au]According to our interpretation, the Meral study is reporting a change from baseline score and we agree that this should not be combined with the other lung function outcomes which are not change scores. We have written a letter to the author to see if lung function data at 60 minutes are available. Until such time, we have elected to remove this study from all analyses and describe it as pending assessment. Should this information be provided, we will re-insert this study in the combined analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: The comparisons need to be separated out into those compared with placebo and those trials that compare with salbutamol. Could Brian discuss reordering the comparison tree with the authors.&lt;br&gt;[Au]The differences between studies in the treatment arms (MgSO4 alone and MgSO4 with salbutamol) were not expected when the protocol was developed. Thus, we had included the analyses of salbutamol versus MgSO4 and salbutamol versus salbutamol + MgSO4 as a post-hoc subgroup assessment. We have moved these analyses to immediately follow the &amp;quot;combined&amp;quot; analysis and then present planned subgroup analyses based on severity and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Contentious issues: Mostly single treatments with albuterol..... I would strongly recommend separating the trials that compared with Salbutamol are NOT combined with those comparing with placebo.&lt;br&gt;[Au] We would prefer to leave the main analyses as including all studies and present the different treatments as a sub-group assessment. However, if upon review of the results in the revised version, it is still recommended to present all results separately we will undertake this assessment for the Cochrane review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Why are the Hughes admission rates so much higher than all the others? [Au] Fortunately, Rodney is a co-author on the review and we have been able to discuss this with him. Patients in the Hughes study were experiencing severe exacerbations. FEV-1 had to be &amp;lt; 50% predicted after the first treatment with salbutamol in order to meet inclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC: Next action: I have deferred further work on this until the comparison tree has been restructured to separate comparison of MgSO4 with placebo (plus or minus salbutamol as a co-intervention) and MgSO4 v salbutamol.&lt;br&gt;[Au]In addition to the changes noted above, we have addressed one of the comments from a co-author who requested we consider the issue of tonicity of the MgSO4 treatment used in each of the studies. A sentence has been added to the description of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Blitz&lt;br&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;9/9/04&lt;br&gt;Dear Brian and Sandra,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the work you have put in on this review!&lt;br&gt;The Metaview graphs all look fine now. Thanks for sorting out the change from baseline issue. I entirely support what you have done on this. Please see text in red in relation to the further comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have given more thought to the issue of the MGso4 v Salbutamol trial. I have to say that including this study in the main results considerably weakens the review. It is most confusing to the reader to say that inhaled magnesium provides benefits instead of beta-agonists. There is one small trial showing no significant difference and no conclusion can be drawn from this, so this comparison is being carried on the trials comparing additional Magnesium to Beta-agonists. The latter really is the clinical question that the review should address and the addition of Mangat adds mud and not enlightenment. I really think it would be best to exclude Mangat from the main analyses and put this trial in as a totally separate comparison. I am sorry this means more work, and thanks for offering to make the analyses separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title&lt;br&gt;Could we change this to Inhaled Magnesium Sulphate to be inline with the other reviews on the library?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;I have made some changes in red reflecting the results from Mag as additional Rx but you will need to change the subgroup sentence please. I am not sure there is enough power here to detect subgroup differences with the small number of studies. **** /please amend the subgroup sentence(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies&lt;br&gt;The red sections are not going to be correct when the studies are separated into comparison with SABA and placebo.

<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">Is inhaled magnesium sulfate a safe and effective treatment for people with asthma attacks?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Update&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:01 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Asthma attacks are common in adults and children. People having an attack may need to be treated in a hospital emergency department (A&amp;E). Even with the best treatment, some people need to be admitted to hospital or even into the intensive care unit. Some guidelines suggest that giving magnesium sulfate, either by injection or inhaled straight into the lungs, may be beneficial. In this review we focused on inhaled (or 'nebulised') magnesium sulfate. We were particularly interested in finding out the effects of magnesium sulfate on lung function (breathing tests), severity scores and hospital admissions. We also wanted to know if it was safe.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for studies in adults and children attending the emergency department with an asthma attack. We included studies which compared giving inhaled magnesium sulfate, plus standard treatment, with standard treatment alone. We also included studies that compared inhaled magnesium sulfate directly with standard treatment. We included studies carried out anywhere in the world, at any time and written in any language.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>We found 25 studies in total, which included nearly 3000 people with asthma attacks. This latest update of the review includes several large trials that were carried out to a very high standard. We found that adding inhaled magnesium sulfate to standard treatments may result in small benefits in terms of lung function, hospital admission and severity scores, but we are uncertain about these findings. This is because many of the studies were carried out in different ways and measured different outcomes at different times so it was quite hard to combine the results from individual studies. Inhaled magnesium sulfate did not seem to cause any serious side effects in the studies we found. We did not find evidence that using inhaled magnesium sulfate <I>instead</I> of standard treatment is beneficial.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>We used a scoring system to rate how confident we are in the findings presented. Our scores ranged from high confidence to very low confidence, but most outcomes we rated as low or very low. This is because we had concerns about the way in which some of the studies were carried out: for example, it was perhaps not clear how people were chosen for the two different treatment groups in the study; or it was unclear whether the patients or people running the trial knew who was getting which treatment. Another factor that reduced our confidence was uncertainty about the combined results: for example in some cases we could not tell whether magnesium sulfate was better, worse or the same.</P>
<P>
<B>Key message </B>
</P>
<P>There is some limited evidence that inhaled magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for people having asthma attacks when added to standard treatment. However, the most recent, high-quality trials did not generally show important benefits. Also, we cannot be sure if some groups may benefit more than other, for example those having more severe attacks.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-11-20 14:40:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-14 19:08:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life-threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO&#8324;) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO&#8324; has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSO&#8324; is less clear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-11-20 14:40:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSO&#8324; administered in acute asthma.</P>
<P>Specific aims: to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO&#8324; I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonist.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:13:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:13:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO&#8324; alone or in combination with &#946;&#8322;-agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co-intervention alone or inactive control.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:14:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:14:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Twenty-five trials (43 references) of varying methodological quality were eligible; they included 2907 randomised patients (2777 patients completed). Nine of the 25 included studies involved adults; four included adult and paediatric patients; eight studies enrolled paediatric patients; and in the remaining four studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 25 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult. The quality of the evidence presented ranged from high to very low, with most outcomes graded as low or very low. This was largely due to concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies and imprecision in the pooled effect estimates.</P>
<P>
<U>Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled &#946;</U>&#8322;<U>-agonist and ipratropium</U>
</P>
<P>We included seven studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent overall and the largest study reporting this outcome found no between-group difference at 60 minutes (MD &#8722;0.3 % predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), 95% CI &#8722;2.71% to 2.11%). Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; participants = 1308; studies = 4; I = 52%) but no difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU. Serious adverse events during admission were rare. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI &#8722;0.03 to 0.05; participants = 1197; studies = 2).</P>
<P>

<P>We included 13 studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a conclusive benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Pooled results for hospital admission showed a point estimate that favoured the combination of MgSO&#8324; and &#946;&#8322;-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; I = 0%). There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD &#8722;0.01, 95% CI &#8722;0.05 to 0.03; participants = 694; studies = 5).</P>

</P>
<P>We included four studies in this comparison. The evidence for the efficacy of &#946;&#8322;-agonists in acute asthma is well-established and therefore this could be considered a historical comparison. Two studies reported a benefit of &#946;&#8322;-agonist over MgSO&#8324; alone for PEFR and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:14:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Treatment with nebulised MgSO&#8324; may result in modest additional benefits for lung function and hospital admission when added to inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSO&#8324; does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events. Individual studies suggest that those with more severe attacks and attacks of shorter duration may experience a greater benefit but further research into subgroups is warranted.</P>
<P>Despite including 24 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. A core outcomes set for studies in acute asthma is needed. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where measuring lung function at the time of an exacerbation may not be possible. Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSO&#8324; has a role in acute asthma. However, the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by reversible airflow obstruction, with periods of relative control and episodes of deterioration referred to as exacerbations. Exacerbations range in severity from mild to life-threatening and can result in visits to healthcare providers and emergency departments, at times necessitating hospital admission. While rare, admissions to the intensive care setting, mechanical ventilation and deaths from severe acute asthma exacerbations do still occur (<LINK REF="REF-NRAD-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRAD 2014</LINK>): thus the prevention and treatment of exacerbations are important considerations for everyone with asthma. Due to its chronicity, variability, risk of mortality, and cost to the healthcare system, asthma remains the cause of significant personal and social burden.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Asthma exacerbations are characterised by acute episodes of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. These episodes generally result in increased requirements for inhaled beta&#8322;-agonist (&#946;&#8322;-agonist) therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2004</LINK>). Unfortunately, in acute asthmatic episodes, &#946;&#8322;-agonists may not be enough to relieve bronchospasm and reduce dyspnoea. The evidence-based guideline for the management of asthma developed by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) offers comprehensive guidance on the acute and chronic management of asthma in children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>). Although the management of children and adults is broadly similar, differences remain between the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in children (less than 16 years old) and adults (16 years and older) (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>For children and adults seen in an emergency department (ED or A&amp;E) with an asthma exacerbation, the BTS/SIGN guideline recommends inhaled or nebulised &#946;&#8322;-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen if needed. International guidelines also recommend the use of inhaled ipratropium for all adults, and children over the age of 5 with severe exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2017</LINK>). For poorly responsive children the next step is nebulised ipratropium (if not already given), and consideration of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO&#8324;) if life-threatening features are identified. Intravenous (IV) MgSO&#8324; (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 2013</LINK>), salbutamol and aminophylline are considered if response remains poor. For poorly responsive adults, or those with a life-threatening exacerbation, the addition of nebulised ipratropium (if not already given) is recommended, with consideration of IV MgSO&#8324; (<LINK REF="REF-Kew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kew 2014</LINK>). Nebulised magnesium sulfate is not recommended for the treatment of adults with acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-10 11:27:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Magnesium sulfate has been proposed as a possible additive treatment in acute asthma, and has been shown to be effective in severe acute asthma when delivered intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kew 2014</LINK>). It may be effective in acute asthma through one or more of a variety of mechanisms. There is evidence that magnesium sulfate may augment the beta receptor response to salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2017</LINK>). Magnesium sulfate has been shown to relax smooth muscle by inhibiting calcium ion influx (<LINK REF="REF-Gourgoulianis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourgoulianis 2001</LINK>); it inhibits acetylcholine and histamine release from cholinergic motor nerve terminals and mast cells respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Castillo-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Castillo 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bois-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bois 1962</LINK>), and promotes synthesis of nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Ashutosh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashutosh 2000</LINK>) and prostacyclin (<LINK REF="REF-Nadler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadler 1987</LINK>), which stimulate broncho- and vasodilation. Finally, magnesium ions may have an anti-inflammatory role, attenuating neutrophil activation in adults with asthma (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=64760244452318359367120209105911&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Cairns-1996">Cairns 1996</A>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:15:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>The potential clinical benefits of nebulised MgSO&#8324; have been studied and research publications have produced conflicting results. Subgroup analysis from one large multi-centre RCT suggests a possible role for MgSO&#8324; in the treatment of children with acute severe asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK>), and has led to current guidance to consider nebulised MgSO&#8324; for children presenting with a life-threatening acute asthma attack (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>). However, nebulised MgSO&#8324; has not yet been used widely in the acute care setting.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>), sixteen trials involving 896 patients were included. Seven studies compared nebulised MgSO&#8324; with &#946;&#8322;-agonist to &#946;&#8322;-agonist alone, three studies compared nebulised MgSO&#8324; to &#946;&#8322;-agonist alone, and two studies compared nebulised MgSO&#8324; with &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium to &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium alone. The review concluded that there was no good evidence that inhaled MgSO&#8324; could be used as a substitute for inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonists; and when used in addition to standard inhaled treatments there was no clear evidence of improved pulmonary function or reduced hospital admissions. However, individual study results from three trials suggest possible improved pulmonary function in those with severe asthma exacerbations. The review called for further studies focusing on inhaled MgSO&#8324; in addition to the current guideline treatment for acute asthma and including those with more severe exacerbations.</P>
<P>A 2013 systematic review including nine trials of nebulised magnesium sulfate (some of which were excluded from the 2012 Cochrane Review) identified benefits in pulmonary function for adults treated with nebulised magnesium sulfate compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, MgSO&#8324; administration in combination with &#946;&#8322;-agonists may be of benefit with respect to pulmonary function in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe acute exacerbations of asthma, and there may be evidence that MgSO&#8324; administered in combination with &#946;&#8322;-agonists reduces hospitalisations. Due to significant heterogeneity among studies, both in terms of treatments and outcome measures, there remains a need for further trials before recommendations can be made regarding the use of nebulised magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations. The rationale for completing this updated systematic review was to examine the influence any further studies would make on these conclusions.</P>

<P>Four studies including 2067 participants reported adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alansari-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alansari 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hossein-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Hossein 2016</LINK>). During admission, more serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group compared to the MgSO&#8324; group, but only one of the two studies reporting this outcome contributed events and the confidence interval includes no difference (RD &#8722;0.03, 95% CI &#8722;0.06 to &#8722;0.00; participants = 557; studies = 2; I = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK> reported a significantly higher 'all adverse event' rate within 30 days of primary attendance for those participants receiving MgSO&#8324; and &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium compared to placebo (saline) and &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium (RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; participants = 690; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) but there was no difference in serious adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hossein-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Hossein 2016</LINK> reported no serious adverse events in either group in the first 60 minutes of treatment.</P>

<P>Eleven studies involving 589 participants reported at least one measure of lung function (<LINK REF="STD-Nannini--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nannini 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abreu_x002d_Gonzalez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abreu-Gonzalez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bessmertny-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bessmertny 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahajan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahajan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokturk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kokturk 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohammedzadeh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammedzadeh 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarhan-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Sarhan 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies reported per cent predicted FEV1; two at 120 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarhan-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Sarhan 2016</LINK>), two at 60 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Bessmertny-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bessmertny 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2003</LINK>) and one at 20 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Mahajan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahajan 2004</LINK>). Due to our concerns about potential baseline imbalance and the population recruited in <LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK> (all pregnant women) we chose not to include this study in the analysis.</P>
<P>Pulmonary function based on per cent predicted FEV1 was improved in those who received MgSO&#8324; and a &#946;&#8322;-agonist compared to &#946;&#8322;-agonist and placebo, but the confidence interval includes no difference (MD 3.34, 95% CI &#8722;1.58 to 8.26; participants = 208; studies = 4), with moderate between-study heterogeneity identified (I = 43%). We did not detect a difference between adults and children, but only one study involving children contributed to the analysis. We were only able to present subgrouping based on severity at presentation with three studies as we were unable to characterise severity in <LINK REF="STD-Sarhan-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Sarhan 2016</LINK>. Results suggest the combination of MgSO&#8324; and salbutamol may be more beneficial in people with a more severe exacerbation (FEV1 &lt; 50% predicted) but the test for subgroup difference was negative (I = 51.8%, P = 0.15). <LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK> reports significantly higher post-treatment per cent predicted FEV1 in pregnant women receiving MgSO&#8324; in addition to salbutamol compared to salbutamol alone; end-point scores were 56.31% (SD 8.25) in the intervention group compared to 32.68% (SD 7.15) (P &lt; 0.001, 30 participants), but baseline FEV1 in each group was not measured.</P>
<P>Six studies reported peak expiratory flow rate (PEF): one at 20 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Nannini--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nannini 2000</LINK>), two at 60 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohammedzadeh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammedzadeh 2014</LINK>), two at 120 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarhan-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Sarhan 2016</LINK>), one at discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Kokturk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kokturk 2005</LINK>). Where studies reported at more than one time point we have extracted and presented the closest time point to 60 minutes. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Badawy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Badawy 2014</LINK> due to the reasons given above and <LINK REF="STD-Kokturk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kokturk 2005</LINK> due to the incompatible time point. We have not pooled adults and children in this analysis. In adults, there was small improvement in PEF compared to the control group, but the confidence interval includes no difference (MD 11.91 L/min, 95% CI &#8722;4.12 to 27.95, participants 155, studies 3, I = 13%, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). A similar small and imprecise effect was seen in <LINK REF="STD-Mohammedzadeh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammedzadeh 2014</LINK>, the study involving children: MD 11.90 L/min, 95% CI &#8722;6.86 to 30.66, participants 80. <LINK REF="STD-Mohammedzadeh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammedzadeh 2014</LINK> also reports a change from baseline "adjusted % PEF", which favours the combination of MgSO&#8324; and salbutamol compared to salbutamol alone (MD 6.70, 95% CI 3.80 to 9.60; data not displayed). <LINK REF="STD-Kokturk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kokturk 2005</LINK> reported "both groups displayed comparable improvement in PEF (%) and clinical scores over 120 min" and displayed results graphically. Discharge mean (SD) per cent predicted PEF was similar in both groups (71.18 (11.55) and 70.50 (12.34)).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2013</LINK>; an abstract) reported "the percentage increase in peak flow" at 10 and 20 minutes, but the lack of clarity about whether this was a per cent change in the absolute values or a change in the per cent predicted meant we could not include data in the analyses. The study reported a greater improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group at both 10 and 20 minutes (20 (SD 4) vs 13 (3) at 10 minutes; and 35 (7) vs 24 (6) at 20 minutes).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abreu_x002d_Gonzalez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abreu-Gonzalez 2002</LINK> (n = 24), also a conference abstract, selectively reports improvement in PEF at 30 minutes for people in the &#946;&#8322;-agonist and MgSO&#8324; group compared to the placebo plus &#946;&#8322;-agonist group and improvement in FEV1 at 45 minutes for those in the &#946;&#8322;-agonist alone with placebo group compared to the &#946;&#8322;-agonist and MgSO&#8324; group.</P>

Although there was a reduction in the risk of admission for people receiving the MgSO&#8324; intervention, the confidence interval includes no difference (risk ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; I = 0%). It should be noted that this analysis is dominated by evidence from adult studies. As we did not detect any statistical heterogeneity in the analysis we did not perform our prespecified subgroup analyses.

Overall, the results are conflicting with some, generally small, benefits seen of adding MgSO&#8324; to standard therapy for an exacerbation of asthma. The larger and more recent studies typically show a smaller effect than some of the older/smaller studies. Serious adverse events were rare across all four comparisons, suggesting the treatment is generally well tolerated in people experiencing moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma. Differences between studies in the populations, outcomes reported and time points limited the number of meta-analyses performed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: MgSO&#8324; and &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium versus placebo and &#946;&#8322;-agonist and ipratropium</HEADING>
<P>We included seven studies in this comparison and were able to extract data on lung function, clinical severity scores, admissions to hospital, vital signs and adverse events. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent and may not be clinically relevant overall. The largest study reporting this outcome reported no between-group difference at 60 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, clinical severity scores typically did not demonstrate a benefit of the intervention compared to control. <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK>, a large study in children, reported a benefit at 60 minutes using the Yung asthma severity score, but the mean difference is unlikely to be clinically important. Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate, but the upper end of the confidence interval includes no difference (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and it is hard to compare the studies as in <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK> almost everyone was admitted to hospital, while in the smaller studies a smaller proportion of participants were admitted.</P>
<P>No difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU, but events were generally rare. Administration of magnesium sulfate has been associated with hypotension and <LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK> reported a slightly higher diastolic blood pressure in the control group, but the effect size was small (MD 2.40 mmHg, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.51). No other between-group differences were detected in the studies reporting vital signs. Finally, serious adverse events during admission were rare and only one study contributed to this analysis. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI &#8722;0.03 to 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK> reported a lower risk of all adverse events in the 30 days after admission in the placebo group, but no difference in serious adverse events (around 10% of people experience a serious adverse event and 15% an adverse event).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: MgSO&#8324; with &#946;&#8322;-agonist versus &#946;&#8322;-agonist</HEADING>
<P>We included 15 studies in this comparison and were able to extract data on lung function, clinical severity scores, admissions to hospital, vital signs and adverse events. While some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a clinically meaningful benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Clinical severity scores were reported using a number of different scales and at different time points, but no consistent difference between the two groups was identified. Pooled results for hospital admission favoured the combination of MgSO&#8324; and &#946;&#8322;-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15). Few studies reported vital signs and of those that did, none detected a significant between-group difference, with results often imprecise. There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD &#8722;0.01, 95% CI &#8722;0.05 to 0.03).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: MgSO&#8324; versus &#946;&#8322;-agonist alone</HEADING>
<P>We included five studies in this comparison and were able to extract data on lung function, clinical severity scores, admissions to hospital, vital signs and adverse events. As the evidence for use of &#946;&#8322;-agonists in acute asthma is well-established this could be considered a historical comparison, no longer in keeping with current clinical practice. Two studies reported a benefit in lung function of &#946;&#8322;-agonist over MgSO&#8324; alone and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. No between-group difference was detected for clinical severity scores (Fischl index) but results are based on only a few small studies, which measured at different time points (MD &#8722;0.13, 95% CI &#8722;0.62 to 0.36; participants = 93). Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. Effects on vital signs were inconsistent; one small study reported lower heart rate in the &#946;&#8322;-agonist group, while pooled results from two studies found a lower respiratory rate in the MgSO&#8324; group. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Comparisons 1 and 2, in which MgSO&#8324; was combined with other bronchodilators, are the most consistent with current clinical guidance, and therefore most applicable to practice (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2017</LINK>). Comparison 3, in which MgSO&#8324; was the only inhaled bronchodilator given during the intervention period in one arm, could be considered a more historical comparison. Given the strong evidence of the efficacy of beta-agonists in acute asthma, it is unlikely that studies with this design would receive ethical approval in many settings.</P>
<P>Within comparisons 1 and 2, populations, interventions, outcomes and time points were heterogeneous, which limited the number of meta-analyses performed and therefore the conclusions reached. However three large, well-powered studies of high methodological quality were added to this 2017 update and overall did not demonstrate a substantial benefit of the addition of inhaled MgSO&#8324; to standard therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alansari-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alansari 2015</LINK>), although modest benefits were seen in some individual studies and meta-analyses. However, we were not able to fully implement our planned subgroup analysis for severity and thus there remains uncertainty about whether those with more severe exacerbations derive greater benefit.</P>
<P>The included studies used a variety of different dosing regimens for MgSO&#8324;, including different numbers and frequency of doses and different MgSO&#8324; formulations. The precise regimen was not described in all included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). A limitation of this review is that we did not attempt to subgroup studies according to dosing regimen used. It is possible that this is an important effect modifier which may require further investigation. Also, we have not attempted to explore the cost-effectiveness of using inhaled MgSO&#8324;; any clinical benefits need to be considered in the context of possible increased costs associated with delivering MgSO&#8324; and monitoring patients during treatment.</P>
<P>We chose lung function (FEV1 and PEFR) as the primary outcome in this review. Lung function may be considered a surrogate outcome in asthma and does not always correlate well with a patient's symptoms, quality of life and asthma control (<LINK REF="REF-Carranza-Rosenzweig-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carranza Rosenzweig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aburuz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aburuz 2005</LINK>). In an acute setting, however, lung function &#8212; particularly peak flow &#8212; is frequently used to guide management and assess response to therapy; and validated patient-reported outcomes such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire have limited applicability during acute exacerbations.</P>
<P>Other uncertainties in the findings are introduced by the lack of consistency between settings in deciding whether, and if so when, to admit patients from the emergency department into the hospital. There were marked differences between studies in terms of the proportion of patients admitted; this may reflect different practices in different hospitals, varied exacerbation severity in those recruited and differences between practices in paediatric and adult populations. Although these variations should be accounted for in the randomisation process within each trial, it introduces clinical heterogeneity into our meta-analyses and further complicates the interpretation of the evidence.</P>
<P>Finally, adverse events were not consistently reported by all studies. However, we were able to extract data extracted from the more recent larger studies and the combined evidence suggest that inhaled MgSO&#8324; is unlikely to be associated with an important increase in serious adverse events in the populations studied &#8212; it should be noted that events were rare.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Our confidence in the results presented in this review ranges from high to very low, but overall most of the evidence was rated as being of low or very low quality. This means the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect presented. Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> for full details of our GRADE assessments. Our confidence was reduced by a number of different considerations.</P>
<P>Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in multiple domains; only four studies were considered to be at low risk of bias in all domains (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodacre-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Goodacre 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alansari-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alansari 2015</LINK>). Many studies did not clearly report their methods of randomisation or allocation. In some studies it was not clear who was masked to treatment group assignment and we had concerns about attrition bias and selective reporting in multiple studies. We downgraded for study limitations when we were judged that a study about which we had important methodological concerns contributed sufficient weight to analysis to potentially affect the overall estimate.</P>
<P>Imprecision was also a problem in many of the meta-analyses with sample sizes too small and events too few to rule out potential important harm or benefit of the intervention. This was a problem in the lung function, hospitalisation and adverse event analyses. Unexplained statistical heterogeneity was encountered less frequently but this may be a result of us being unable to perform meta-analyses with substantial numbers of studies contributing data. Indirectness was not thought to be a problem in any of the outcomes to which we applied GRADE and we did not have sufficient studies in any one analysis to formally assess publication bias using a funnel plot.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Publication bias may have influenced the result of this meta-analysis. For example, by missing unpublished negative trials we may be over-estimating the effect of MgSO&#8324; treatment. In order to reduce bias, however, a comprehensive and systematic search of the published and unpublished literature for potentially relevant studies was conducted and we have recently updated it. This was followed by our attempts to contact corresponding and first authors. However, we recognise that unpublished data may exist.</P>
<P>We conducted our review in accordance with Cochrane methods and have detailed changes between the protocol and the review in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> section. One such difference, which may have introduced bias, is the selection of the '60 minute' time point for reporting outcomes. Many studies reported outcome at multiple time points and for consistency we selected the outcome closest to 60 minutes from baseline for meta-analysis. We chose this time point by consensus to maximise the homogeneity of pooled results and because this was identified as a clinically relevant time point for decision making about treatment escalation (i.e. there would be an expectation that most patients are showing a response to treatment with an hour). It is conceivable that choice of a different time point might have led to different conclusions, especially for the lung function and clinical severity score indices, which may be more susceptible to fluctuations over short periods of time.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>The conclusions in this updated Cochrane Review are broadly consistent with the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2012</LINK>): that there may be some modest benefits associated with addition of magnesium sulfate (MgSO&#8324;) to standard therapy for acute asthma. However, the addition of several large and well-conducted studies suggests that there is unlikely to be a substantial additional benefit associated with the addition of inhaled MgSO&#8324;. Although we now have more data in children and the effect appears to be similar to that seen in adults, formal subgrouping by age was not always possible due to lack of sufficient data and between-trial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, no other systematic review has included as many primary studies as the present review and therefore conclusions are not entirely comparable and findings are somewhat conflicting. Overall, systematic reviews published to date have failed to demonstrate a conclusive benefit of inhaled magnesium sulfate in acute asthma and have suggested the role of the intervention remains unclear. For example, a systematic review published in 2006 included six studies, all of which are included in the present review. Despite some evidence of benefit, the authors were unable to reach conclusions due to lack of evidence and stated that the role of inhaled magnesium sulfate remains unclear. Similarly, a 2005 review also included six studies and concluded that nebulised MgSO&#8324; may confer some benefits in terms of pulmonary function and hospital admission, but called for more research (<LINK REF="REF-Blitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blitz 2005</LINK>). These findings are also consistent with the systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Mohammed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohammed 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>More recently, a 2016 systematic review summarised the literature for both inhaled and intravenous magnesium sulfate in children with acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2017</LINK>). The review included four studies of nebulised magnesium sulfate in children, three of which we included and one which we excluded as it was a study of methacholine challenge test in stable asthma. The review concluded there was no impact on hospital admission or lung function. Similarly, a 2012 systematic review in adults included six studies of nebulised MgSO&#8324; (all of which are included in the present review) and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the use of this intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2012</LINK>). A 2016 review identified 10 relevant trials and concluded "adding nebulized MgSO&#8324; neither improved pulmonary function nor reduced the number of hospital admissions in adult patients with acute asthma" (<LINK REF="REF-Ling-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 2016</LINK>). Finally, a 2013 review of both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulfate suggested that there is a benefit for adults in terms of hospital admissions and lung function, but no benefit seen in children (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 2013</LINK>). However, this study included only nine trials of inhaled magnesium sulfate, all of which are included in the present review with the exception of one, because we did not consider it to be an RCT.</P>
<P>Finally, two recent Cochrane Reviews have examined the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) MgSO&#8324; in adults and children with acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kew 2014</LINK>). The review in adults included 14 studies, randomising over 2000 participants, and concluded that "a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO&#8324; over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta&#8322;-agonists and IV corticosteroids". Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety (<LINK REF="REF-Kew-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kew 2014</LINK>). The evidence in children is more limited with only five studies, involving 182 children, included in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2016</LINK>). The authors conclude that IV MgSO&#8324; may reduce the need for hospital admission in children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations, but emphasise the small number of trials and participants. Clinicians managing acute asthma and considering the use of a magnesium preparation will need to choose between the inhaled and IV route; at this time, the evidence for IV magnesium may seem more persuasive, in keeping with guidance (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2016</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:56:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Treatment with nebulised MgSO&#8324; may result in modest additional benefits when added to inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSO&#8324; does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events or all adverse events, but serious events were rare and results lacked precision. Those with a more severe exacerbation may experience a greater benefit but as we were unable to implement our planned subgroup analysis for severity this remains an area of uncertainty. Evidence regarding the use of nebulised MgSO&#8324; as an alternative to beta-agonists is sparse and inconclusive. Given the wealth of evidence about the use of beta-agonists in acute asthma it seems unlikely that future trials will address this question directly.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-16 09:56:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Rebecca Normansell">
<P>Despite including 25 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. An agreement on the core outcomes for studies in acute asthma is needed so that any acute asthma study has the same outcomes measured &#8212; physiological, cost and those relevant to patients. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where lung function measurement may be more challenging.</P>
<P>Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled &#946;&#8322;-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSO&#8324; has a role in acute asthma, although the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely. Trials comparing the safety and efficacy of inhaled MgSO&#8324; to intravenous MgSO&#8324;, including an economic evaluation, are also of interest.</P>
