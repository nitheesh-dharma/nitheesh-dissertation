<P>The clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) have much in common. As patients with DLB and PDD have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, blocking its breakdown using a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement. Six trials showed a statistically significant improvement in global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD) patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND-PD. In a single trial, no statistically significant improvement was observed in patients with DLB who were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and further trials are necessary to clarify the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient group.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-12 14:13:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-12 14:21:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross-over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of PDD (<A HREF="Aarsland 2002a">Aarsland 2002a</A>; <A HREF="Dubois 2007">Dubois 2007</A>; <A HREF="Emre 2004">Emre 2004</A>; <A HREF="Ravina 2005">Ravina 2005</A>), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished (n = 550). <A HREF="Leroi 2004">Leroi 2004</A> included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with DLB were included in only one of the trials (<A HREF="McKeith 2000">McKeith 2000</A>).</P>
<P>For global assessment, three trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitor treatment to placebo in PDD (<A HREF="Aarsland 2002a">Aarsland 2002a</A>; <A HREF="Emre 2004">Emre 2004</A>; <A HREF="Ravina 2005">Ravina 2005</A>) reported a difference in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) score of -0.38, favouring the cholinesterase inhibitors (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.24, P &lt; 0.0001). A clinically meaningful improvement was observed in 19.8% of patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, compared to 14.5% of those in the placebo group.</P>
<P>For cognitive function, a pooled estimate of the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function measures was consistent with the presence of a therapeutic benefit (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.23, P &lt; 0.00001). There was evidence of a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with PDD (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73, P = 0.0008) and in the single PDD and CIND-PD trial (WMD 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.68, P = 0.01) but not in the single DLB trial.</P>
<P>For behavioural disturbance, analysis of the pooled continuous data relating to behavioural disturbance rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.01).</P>
<P>For activities of daily living, combined data for the ADCS and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.02, P = 0.03).</P>
<P>For safety and tolerability, those taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were more likely to experience an adverse event (318/452 versus 668/842; odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003) and to drop out (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006). Adverse events were more common amongst those taking rivastigmine (357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P &lt; 0.0001) but not those taking donepezil (311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25). Parkinsonian symptoms in particular tremor (64/739 versus 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.09, P = 0.002), but not falls (P = 0.39), were reported more commonly in the treatment group but this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (P = 0.71). Fewer deaths occurred in the treatment group than in the placebo group (4/465 versus 9/279; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84, P = 0.03).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-10 10:25:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-13 04:43:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>'When you've seen one patient with dementia, you've seen one patient with dementia'. This commonplace observation about the wide heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of dementia raises the possibility that there may be useful diagnostic subdivisions. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease but there are several others, of which dementia with Lewy bodies is arguably the second most common.</P>
<P>Lewy bodies are the defining pathological feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These inclusion bodies are found in the cytoplasm of cells of a wide variety of subcortical nuclei, including those of monoaminergic neurons. They are more likely to occur in cortical neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease when the patients also have dementia. A defining constituent is fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein involved in vesicle formation (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>). One current theory about why Lewy bodies form is that the cellular mechanisms for degrading and disposing of intracellular protein fragments (proteasomes) are dysfunctional (<LINK REF="REF-Olanow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olanow 2006</LINK>). In epidemiological studies, up to 30% of those people with dementia have Lewy bodies (<LINK REF="REF-Zaccai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaccai 2005</LINK>). The rate of dementia in clinical Parkinson's disease (24% to 31%) (<LINK REF="REF-Aarsland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarsland 2005</LINK>) is at least two to five times that expected in age matched controls. Longitudinal studies suggest that most patients with Parkinson's disease who survive will eventually develop dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Aarsland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarsland 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Scope of this review</HEADING>
<P>Previous Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) (<LINK REF="REF-Maidment-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maidment 2006</LINK>) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2003</LINK>). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common. There is some convergence of opinion that DLB and PDD may be the same condition, but the matter is not fully resolved because DLB and PDD have slightly different neuropathological correlates (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of PDD rests on the occurrence of formally diagnosed Parkinson's disease followed at least 12 months later by dementia (with no other apparent cause identified). Most patients with Parkinson's disease have at least subtle deficits in neuropsychological function, typically affecting visuospatial and sometimes executive function. In many cases this does not cause problems and is only apparent on detailed specialist evaluation. Cognitive impairment that is clinically significant typically involves more clear-cut deficits in these areas but also tends to affect attention. These are the three areas of function (visuospatial, executive, attention) prominently affected early in patients labelled DLB. Memory function may be affected late in the process. Dementia is more likely to occur in those in whom the Parkinson's disease develops later, and tends to be of the postural instability-gait disorder subtype and to be associated with visual hallucinations when treated with L-dopamine (L-DOPA). The development of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease increases caregiver distress, nursing home requirements and mortality, twofold. It also reduces quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bedard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burn 2003</LINK>). Similarly, parkinsonism in Alzheimer's disease increases the cost of care (<LINK REF="REF-Bostrom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bostrom 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The formal distinction between PDD and early cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease rests on the definition of dementia. Dementia is defined as occurring when cognitive impairment is of a severity or type such that it interferes with day-to-day occupational and social functioning. However, it is particularly difficult to judge reliably whether any impairment in function in Parkinson's disease is due to cognitive decline or alternatively to the motor, mood or personality changes which may occur. In this review, we have therefore also included a further group of patients, patients who have Parkinson's disease and who have clinically significant cognitive impairment but in whom the diagnosis of dementia has not been formally established. This is analogous to the 'Cognitive Impairment, Not Dementia (CIND)' category and will be termed 'CIND-PD'. This approach is consistent with the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-R) criteria (294.1x).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of 'probable DLB' is more complex than that for PDD. It depends on the presence of two of: persistent visual hallucinations; fluctuations in cognitive and functional ability; and parkinsonism. If parkinsonian symptoms are part of the picture, dementia should have occurred within 12 months of the onset of the parkinsonian symptoms. Additionally, 'probable DLB' can be diagnosed if just one of these original features is present plus one of the following: severe sensitivity to neuroleptics; rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder; or evidence of striatal dopamine transporter protein loss on neuroimaging (<LINK REF="REF-McKeith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other symptoms that support the diagnosis but are of less clear-cut diagnostic value are repeated falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, severe autonomic dysfunction (for example orthostatic hypotension), urinary incontinence, systematised delusions, non-visual hallucinations, depression, relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, generalized low uptake on single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or a positron emission tomography (PET) perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity, abnormal (low uptake) [123I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy and prominent slow wave activity on electroencephalography (EEG) with temporal lobe transient sharp waves. Olfactory function may also be impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The distinction between PDD and DLB was introduced in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-McKeith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 1996</LINK>). It was recognised at the time that these conditions had much in common, and that the cut-off period of 12 months was arbitrary. The distinction was in part driven by the fact that, in some health systems, patients who develop Parkinson's disease first tend to see neurologists whereas those who develop cognitive impairment first tend to see psychiatrists. It also reflected in the fact that regulators can only issue licenses for drugs where a claim is made for the drug in a clearly defined (and accepted) condition. In the third revision of the consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-McKeith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 2005</LINK>), the DLB consortium has suggested that a generic term such as Lewy body disease (LB disease) may be helpful when PDD and DLB are considered together, but that in clinical situations the terms PDD and DLB should be retained as they differentiate between whether symptoms of dementia occur before or after those of Parkinson's disease.</P>
<P>By considering the results of treatment trials for PDD, DLB and CIND-PD, both separately and together, it may be possible to see whether there is any difference in the response to cholinesterase inhibitors in these conditions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for cholinesterase inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>Lewy bodies occur in the dopamine-producing cells of the substantia nigra, where their presence is associated with the movement problems of Parkinson's disease. However, alpha-synuclein aggregation occurs in many other brain areas too and the extent of this may correlate with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Braak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braak 2006</LINK>). A broad correlation can also be made between the areas affected and specific clinical symptoms: cholinergic deficits and attention or memory (<LINK REF="REF-Nakano-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakano 1984</LINK>); serotonergic deficits and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Jellinger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jellinger 1994</LINK>); dopaminergic deficits and visuospatial or executive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dubois-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubois 1997</LINK>); and cortical LBs and executive function impairment. In his original description, Frederick Lewy actually put more emphasis on the occurrence of LBs in the large cells of the substantia innominata (now named the nucleus basalis of Myenert). We now know that these cells synthesise acetylcholine and project widely to cortical areas. This nucleus is also affected by the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with DLB or PDD have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of acetylcholine and its enzyme for synthesis, even exceeding the deficits of patients with just Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1994</LINK>). The key neuropathological defect that is targeted by cholinesterase inhibitors is therefore present in AD, PDD and DLB. Moreover, the lower cholinergic functioning in DLB and PDD may indicate a greater potential improvement from these drugs than that seen in AD. Since there are fewer neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques and less neuronal loss in DLB than AD (<LINK REF="REF-Lippa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippa 1998</LINK>), it is possible that cortical neurons in DLB are more viable than those in AD and could be more responsive to cholinergic stimulation. Similarly, because those patients with visual hallucinations and more profound deficits in attention tend to have worse cholinergic deficits, the presence of this symptom may be a predictor of treatment response.</P>
<P>The combination of psychotic features and parkinsonism which occurs in DLB and PDD can be particularly difficult to manage. Antipsychotic drugs used to treat hallucinations, delusions and agitation can dramatically worsen cognitive and extrapyramidal symptoms and may lead to severe, and even fatal, neuroleptic sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-McKeith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeith 1992</LINK>). Conversely, L-DOPA treatment of parkinsonism can exacerbate the psychosis. Given that anticholinergic agents are effective in reducing symptoms of tremor in Parkinson's disease, there are theoretical reasons why 'pro-cholinergic' interventions such as cholinesterase inhibitors, which act to reduce breakdown of acetylcholine, might worsen the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Drug licensing</HEADING>
<P>To date, rivastigmine is the only cholinesterase inhibitor that is licensed for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in the UK (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and the USA (Federal Drug Authority). The use of donepezil and galantamine is only licensed in mild to moderate Alzkeimer's disease.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Asessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Review authors (MR, RMcS) independently assessed the quality of the trials according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Where the review authors (MR, RMcS) identified bias and agreed that it was significant, trials were excluded from further analysis; reasons for such exclusion were given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports (MR). Any uncertainty over inclusion or exclusion of a trial, methodological quality or data extraction were settled by discussion with a second review author (RMcS) who had previously extracted data in an earlier draft of this review.</P>
<P>The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data was the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at the final time point were extracted, if available. Results from the donepezil groups in a study which compared two doses of donepezil were combined (<LINK REF="STD-Dubois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 2007</LINK>). For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomisation, but no longer than two months earlier. Data from titration phases prior to the randomised phase, or from open label follow-up periods, were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were not randomised or treatments concealed.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis plan</HEADING>
<P>Data for trials in each 'condition' (that is PDD, DLB, CIND-PD) were considered separately for each outcome measure. Data for the conditions were also combined. It was intended that data for the three conditions would be considered both separately and combined. Results were also analysed according to the cholinesterase used and the duration of the trial. Results were examined to establish whether any heterogeneity was explicable on the basis of the condition. Where there was no heterogeneity, then the focus in the text was determined by the number and quality of trials. Where the heterogeneity of results was high, as indicated by I² &gt; 40%, this was reported in the text.</P>

<P>Both the total number of dropouts and the number of dropouts due to adverse events were significantly higher in the treatment group as compared to the patients receiving placebo (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006 and 73/430 versus 22/247; OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.55, P = 0.004). The placebo group experienced significantly fewer adverse events (668/842 versus 318/452; OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003), although the number of adverse events that were judged to be severe was not significantly different between the two groups (21/73 versus 15/73; OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.81, P = 0.28). Interestingly, the increase in the number of dropouts and adverse events in the treatment group were significant in studies using rivastigmine (117/421 versus 42/240; OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.71, P = 0.003 and 357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) but not in the studies using donepezil (11/44 versus 3/39; OR 3.64, 95% CI 0.99 to 13.46, P = 0.05 and 311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25, respectively). Parkinsonian symptoms were reported more commonly in the treatment group (139/739 versus 40/352; OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.75, P = 0.001), however this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.29, P = 0.71) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-07-13 05:47:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified six trials to help us assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD). Where possible, we considered outcome measures for the separate diseases as well as combining the data available to estimate the general effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on Lewy body disease.</P>
<P>Currently available evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors improve global assessment measures in patients with PDD, with no data for DLB and CIND-PD being available. As there was no evidence of a positive impact of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function and behavioural disturbance rating scales in patients with DLB, the overall response in favour of using cholinesterase inhibitors is likely to be due to the effect seen in patients with PDD. As only one of the six trials included in this meta-analysis randomised patients with DLB, the over-representation of patents with PDD could have a substantial effect on the overall effects. The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on measures of activities of daily living was not assessed in the DLB population but was statistically significant in the very small trial which included both patients with PDD and CIND-PD.</P>
<P>The trials that were included provided evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors were not as well tolerated as placebo, with significantly more adverse effects and dropouts seen in the active treatment group. Reassuringly, the frequency of severe adverse effects was the same in both groups. Indeed, death rates were lower amongst those taking the active drug than placebo, though this is based on small numbers. Although parkinsonian symptoms, and tremor in particular, were reported more frequently as adverse effects in patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, this did not seem to have an impact on the Parkinson's disease severity rating scales.</P>
<P>An important limitation of the current review lies in the incomplete public presentation of data from the important <LINK REF="STD-Dubois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 2007</LINK> study, which was sponsored by Pfizer. The study was completed prior to current US legislation on trial registration.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-25 18:42:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patient with PDD and CIND-PD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales. The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on patients with DLB has only been investigated in one small study and, therefore, evidence for their use in this patient group is less clear.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-12 14:10:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with DLB were under-represented in this meta-analysis and further randomised evidence is required to reduce the uncertainty of the effects that cholinesterase inhibitors have in this patient group. A large trial of donepezil in patients with CIND-PD was due to commence in 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Burn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Burn 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Dear Rolinski et al.,</P>
<P>I am writing to you regarding the Cochrane meta-analysis of Cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia with lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD).</P>
<P>The first issue I wanted to address was regarding the conclusion of the available evidence supporting the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD. These results were driven primarily by Emre 2004, which used last observation carried forward for any missing data. This study had a significant dropout rate compared to placebo (99 and 32, respectively). In the end, only 72.7% of patients in the treatment group completed the study. When a study uses the last observation carried forward in a patient population with a progressively worsening disease state, you tend to reflect a better response in the treatment arm than actual response. You conclude that cholinesterase inhibitors improve global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD. However, this could likely be due to initial assessments of the treatment group and subsequently, a significant portion of the treatment group dropped out due to significantly more adverse effects compared to placebo. On the other hand, most of the placebo group stayed throughout the trial, then declined clinically due to a progressively worsening condition and was eventually captured in the results. The use of last observation carried forward in a dementia population likely favours more toxic drugs like cholinesterase inhibitors over placebo and can also introduce bias which may exaggerate the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors.</P>
<P>The next issue I wanted to address was in regards to the assessment tools used to measure cognitive function. Cognitive function was mainly measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-COG) in these trials. There was a statistically significant mean difference in MMSE score of 1.08 and ADAS-COG of -2.72, both favouring cholinesterase inhibitors. However, a statistically significant difference may not necessarily mean clinical significance. A cohort study published in 2012 analysed the ADAS-COG tool and found a difference of 3.1-3.8 points to be clinically significant. Also, clinical guidelines and most studies use a change of 4 points or more in the ADAS-COG to be considered clinically significant. As for the MMSE, a change of 3 points or more is considered clinically significant. A reader that is unfamiliar with the ADAS-COG and MMSE might be misled into thinking that cholinesterase inhibitors would have a clinically meaningful impact on cognitive function.</P>
<P>These results were driven primarily by Emre 2004 and since this study had limitations such as last observation carried forward, as mentioned above, and having a non-clinically relevant change in the assessment tools, I feel that the conclusion made by Rolinski et al. had a very strong recommendation favouring the use of anticholinesterase inhibitors. The issues addressed above were not addressed in the Cochrane review and may mislead others into thinking that the anticholinesterase inhibitors are more effective than they actually are. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.</P>

<P>We completely agree that imputing missing data using the &#8220;last observation carried forward&#8221; (LOCF) approach may introduce bias into the analysis, with attrition secondary to the side effects of the study medication. However, we feel that we have already addressed this issue in the review and disagree with the conclusions that have been drawn in the feedback received. Firstly, the use of LOCF is discussed in the &#8220;Risk of bias in included studies&#8221; that can be found on page seven of the review. Further assessment of potential bias is included in the description of included studies that starts on page 18 of the review. Here, in the case of Leroi et al., 2004, the risk of bias was assessed to be high, owing to a high dropout rate and the use of LOCF. In the Emre study, 362 subjects were randomised to rivastigmine, and 263 continued on drug to the end. Three hundred and twenty nine subjects had a ADASCog score in the primary LOCF analysis, with the authors stating: &#8216;Patients who discontinued treatment prematurely were encouraged to attend assessments at predefined times; when available, the results of these assessments were used for efficacy analyses&#8217;. However, it is not stated what the extent of this &#8216;retrieved dropout&#8217; data was. Therefore, we do not know to what extent the data reflect genuine ITT. The authors stated they performed sensitivity analyses, one with LOCF and one where only complete datasets were included, with results consistent with the findings presented in their publication. If the data for the Emre completers had been presented (e.g. in an online supplementary table) then this could have been assessed further in our review. Moreover, in relation to the Dubois study, we have repeatedly stated that the fact that the study data is not available is problematic.</P>
<P>LOCF is particularly problematic when there is differential dropout and marked decline in cognitive function in the placebo group. However, in this study, the decline in placebo was small whereas those on rivastigmine tended to improve. Importantly, Emre and colleagues also performed further analyses looking at clinically relevant changes. They showed that patients receiving treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors were more likely to have a moderate or marked improvement and were less likely to have a moderate or marked worsening in their cognitive function, when compared to the placebo group using the Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician&#8217;s Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC).</P>
<P>We consider that the 3 point MMSE criteria is excessively stringent, and prefer the Howard et al (DOI: 10.1002/gps.2607) criterion of 1.4 MMSE point for MCID, but acknowledge that this is still higher than the mean 1.08 achieved here. (We were unaware of the Schrag 2012 study &#8211; thank you for drawing our attention to this &#8211; but this was published after our review). However, in determining the MCID, there is controversy over whether ANY significant difference in the Global Impression of Change is sufficient to justify a claim of clinical utility. It is our belief that, when supported by other measures (as is the case with multiple outcomes in Emre) there is sufficient evidence to claim clinical utility. This is based on the clinical experience that the rating of global change over 6 months in patients with dementia, whose condition fluctuates and declines, is prone to all sorts of influence that would militate against showing an effect.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the wording of the conclusion of the Abstract reflects a judgment based on the balance of the evidence. We do not propose to change the key sentence &#8216;The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales&#8217;.</P>
<P>However, in order to contextualise this further, we propose to add to the abstract:</P>
<P>a) The known sample size of Dubois (N=550) and a comment in the Author&#8217;s Conclusion that: &#8216;Almost half the trial data, which could potentially change this conclusion, have not been made public&#8217;.</P>
<P>b) A comment that 80% of people who take RVS had no clinically meaningful improvement in Emre (Main Results Para2).</P>
<P>Moreover, add the following to &#8216;Reporting of withdrawals or dropouts&#8217;: &#8220;Emre did not include a supplementary table reporting the details of completer analysis. It is therefore impossible to assess the impact of retrieval of dropouts on the validity of the LOCF-ITT analysis&#8221;.</P>
