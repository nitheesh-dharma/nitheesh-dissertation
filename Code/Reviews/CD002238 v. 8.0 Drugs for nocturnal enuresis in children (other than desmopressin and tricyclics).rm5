<TITLE>Drug treatment for children with bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) but not including the drug types desmopressin or tricyclics</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:45:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is the involuntary loss of urine at night without an underlying organic disease as the cause. It can result in social problems, sibling teasing and lowered self esteem. It affects around 15% to 20% of five-year olds, and up to 2% of adults. Many different types of drugs have been used to treat children with bed wetting. There is not enough reliable evidence to show that drugs other than desmopressin or tricyclics reduce bedwetting in children during treatment when used in isolation, despite their risk of unwanted side effects. In other Cochrane reviews, alarms triggered by wetting, desmopressin and tricyclic drugs have been shown to work during treatment. However, alarms have a more sustained effect than desmopressin and tricyclics after treatment has finished. The adverse effects of alarm therapy (tiredness and waking other members of the family) are relatively benign and self limiting compared with the adverse effects of drugs. One class of drugs (anticholinergic drugs) appears to improve the efficacy of other established treatments such as tricyclics, bedwetting alarms and desmopressin. The cost of treating children with bedwetting with alarm therapy or drugs may vary in different countries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:12:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially stigmatising and stressful condition which affects around 15% to 20% of five-year olds and up to 2% of young adults. Although there is a high rate of spontaneous remission, the social, emotional and psychological costs to the children can be great. Drugs (including desmopressin, tricyclics and other drugs) have often been tried to treat nocturnal enuresis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of drugs other than desmopressin and tricyclics on nocturnal enuresis in children and to compare them with other interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:13:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials (searched 15 December 2011), which includes searches of MEDLINE and CENTRAL, to identify published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials. The reference lists of relevant articles were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:18:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised trials of drugs (excluding desmopressin or tricyclics) for treating nocturnal enuresis in children up to the age of 16 years were included in the review. Trials were eligible for inclusion if children were randomised to receive drugs compared with placebo, other drugs or behavioral interventions for nocturnal enuresis. Studies which included children with daytime urinary incontinence or children with organic conditions were also included in this review if the focus of the study was on nocturnal enuresis. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting and trials of adults with nocturnal enuresis were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:45:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials and extracted data. Differences between review authors were settled by discussion with a third review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-24 10:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 40 randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (10 new in this update) met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1780 out of 2440 children who enrolled receiving an active drug other than desmopressin or a tricyclic. In all, 31 different drugs or classes of drugs were tested. The trials were generally small or of poor methodological quality. There was an overall paucity of data regarding outcomes after treatment was withdrawn.</P>
<P>For drugs versus placebo,<B> </B>when compared to placebo indomethacin (risk ratio [RR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79), diazepam (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.46), mestorelone (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.62) and atomoxetine (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94) appeared to reduce the number of children failing to have 14 consecutive dry nights. Although indomethacin and diclofenac were better than placebo during treatment, they were not as effective as desmopressin and there was a higher chance of adverse effects. None of the medications were effective in reducing relapse rates, although this was only reported in five placebo controlled trials.</P>
<P>For drugs versus drugs,<B> </B>combination therapy with imipramine and oxybutynin was more effective than imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94) and also had significantly lower relapse rates than imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77). There was an overall paucity of data regarding outcomes after treatment was withdrawn.</P>
<P>For drugs versus behavioural therapy,<B> </B>bedwetting alarms were found to be better than amphetamine (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.29), oxybutynin (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.98), and oxybutynin plus holding exercises (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.84 to 6.18) in reducing the number of children failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of drugs were seen in 19<B> </B>trials while 17 trials did not adequately report the occurrence of side effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-15 09:17:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting when used alone. There was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin, imipramine and enuresis alarms therapy were better than the included drugs to which they were compared. In other reviews, desmopressin, tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective during treatment. There was also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates, by about 20%, although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. Future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of seven reviews of interventions for bedwetting, or nocturnal enuresis. The others focus on desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>), tricyclics and related drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), enuresis alarm therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005a</LINK>), simple behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), complex behavioural and educational interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>) and complementary and miscellaneous therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>). This review is an update of previous updates by Glazener et al (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003</LINK>) based on the original review by Lister-Sharp and her colleagues at the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the promotion by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) of using standardised nomenclature in paediatric continence research (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>) and the improved understanding about the pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis, there has been an emphasis on classifying enuresis as either monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic. As a result, there have been more published studies examining the effects of anticholinergic medication both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to other therapies. The ICCS has also defined initial and long term treatment success. Unfortunately, the older studies have usually not used these definitions (or were unclear about their definition of initial success). There were no studies that included two-year follow up and therefore long term success could not be assessed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalences and causes</HEADING>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is common in children. Estimating the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is difficult because there is variation in the diagnostic criteria, with very few studies using ICCS definitions (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krantz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krantz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). The generally quoted prevalence rates are 15% to 20% of five-year olds, 7% of seven-year olds, 5% of 10-year olds, 2% to 3% of teenagers and 0.5% to 2% of adults, with a spontaneous remission rate of 14% until adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>). The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is higher amongst children in residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Butler proposed the conceptual model that nocturnal enuresis occurs when there is poor arousal from sleep in response to a full bladder sensation with overactivity of bladder functioning or excessive overnight urine production, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2004</LINK>). There are also many known risk factors for nocturnal enuresis including:</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:39:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is the intermittent involuntary loss of urine at night, in the absence of physical disease, at an age when a child could reasonably be expected to be dry (by consensus, at a developmental age of five years) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Nocturnal enuresis has a significant negative impact on the child's psychosocial wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>). Children with nocturnal enuresis who do not have daytime bladder symptoms are deemed to have 'monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis' (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Between 10% and 28% of children who wet the bed also have bladder problems during the day (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>), and are said to have 'non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis' (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Although daytime urinary incontinence is a significant problem it is usually considered separately to nocturnal enuresis as the aetiologies underlying the two conditions are thought to be different (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>). Physical causes such as structural abnormalities and functional disorders of the urinary tract, including overactive bladder syndrome or urinary tract infections, are more often found in children who also have daytime wetting (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1990</LINK>). If daytime symptoms are present, investigations to identify physical (organic) causes such as urinary tract dysfunction, congenital malformation and neurogenic disorders are usually necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>), with treatment initially focused on addressing the daytime urinary symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hjalmas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjalmas 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in nocturnal enuresis continues to evolve. We now know that between 10% and 28% of children who wet the bed also have bladder problems during the day (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>), and are said to have non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>), with a total of 6.6% of children having combined daytime urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Sureshkumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sureshkumar 2009</LINK>). However, daytime urinary incontinence will be reviewed in a separate Cochrane review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pharmacological, psychological or behavioural and a variety of 'unconventional' interventions are commonly used for treating bedwetting.</P>
<P>Pharmacological interventions include desmopressin, tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin, trimipramine, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline and protriptyline), drugs related to the tricyclics (viloxazine, desipramine, mianserin and maprotiline), amphetamine, diazepam and oxybutynin; although some are now contraindicated.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions include alarms, overlearning, star charts, reward systems, retention control training, fluid deprivation, lifting, scheduled wakening, complex behavioural interventions (for example dry bed training and full spectrum home training).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</HEADING>
<P>Indomethacin and diclofenac have been tested in trials to treat enuresis. They are believed to act by prostaglandin or cyclooxygenase inhibition pathways. The rationale for this treatment is based on the findings that reduced levels of prostaglandins (PGE2) correlate to a favourable response to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sener-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sener 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Psychoactive drugs</HEADING>
<P>Historically, amphetamine (stimulant) and diazepam (tranquillizer) were used for treating nocturnal enuresis, in order to alter sleep levels. Other psychoactive drugs used in the treatment of enuresis include meprobamate (anxiolytic) and hydroxyzine (antihistamine); ephedrine sulphate (adrenergic); amphetamine and methedrine (stimulants); chlordiazepoxide (long-acting benzodiazepine, anxiolytic and anticholinergic); piracetam (GABA analogue, said to increase the activity of the associative brain system); emepronium (antimuscarinic or atropine-like action); methscopolamine (hyoscine metanitrate: antimuscarinic or atropine-like action); chlorprothixene (antipsychotic and sedative, blocks post-synaptic dopamine receptors and alpha receptors) and phenmetrazine (sympathomimetic used for anorexia). The rationale for the use of these medications in enuresis was guided by an earlier belief that nocturnal enuresis was the result of a conflict or anxiety. Many of these drugs are now considered to be contraindicated for treating nocturnal enuresis in children. Some drugs are not licensed or have had their licences discontinued, including emepronium (Ceteprin) and methscopolamine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Anticholinergics</HEADING>
<P>More recently, oxybutynin (antispasmodic, anticholinergic) has been tried primarily for treating detrusor overactivity, which would be expected to result in improvement in daytime as well as night-time wetting. This is possibly because a subgroup of children with nocturnal enuresis (non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis) also have associated detrusor overactivity or nocturnal detrusor overactivity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other drugs</HEADING>
<P>Drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder such as methylphenidate and atomoxetine (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) have also been tested.</P>
<P>The following interventions will be included only if they are compared with any of the above drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Desmopressin</HEADING>
<P>The most commonly used drug for treating nocturnal enuresis is desmopressin (a vasopressin analogue). When administered at bedtime, it helps to reduce nocturnal urine production with a beneficial effect on the symptom of enuresis in a large proportion (70%) of children with nocturnal enuresis. There is a separate desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis review (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tricyclic drugs</HEADING>
<P>Tricyclic drugs act on the central nervous system by blocking the synaptic alpha receptor reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin into the neurons, thus prolonging their effects. The usual clinical use of tricyclics is as antidepressants. Additionally, they have anticholinergic or antispasmodic effects, local anaesthetic properties and affect the sleep centre in the brain. Tricyclic drugs include imipramine, amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin, trimipramine, clomipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline and protriptyline. Drugs which are pharmacologically related are viloxazine, desipramine and mianserin. The beneficial effect of imipramine was initially attributed to its anticholinergic effects, but it has been recently shown that imipramine can be of help in children who have not responded to anticholinergic therapy (Gepertz 2004), suggesting that there may be another mechanism of action. There is a separate review on tricyclics for nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behavioural and other interventions</HEADING>
<P>Behavioural interventions include enuresis alarm therapy and overlearning (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005a</LINK>); complex behavioural interventions such as dry bed training, multi-dimensional behavioural training (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>); and simple behavioural interventions such as retention control training, fluid deprivation, lifting, random wakening and star charts (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>). Other interventions include complementary and miscellaneous interventions such as acupuncture, hypnosis, chiropractic and homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>). These are evaluated in separate reviews.</P>
<P>The current review is restricted to pharmacological treatment with drugs (other than desmopressin or tricyclic and related antidepressants) or to other interventions only if they are compared with such drugs. None of these drugs are now in current use for treating children with enuresis as primary therapy. Certain drugs may have increased clinical applicability in the future as supplementary medications which may be shown to improve bladder function.</P>
<P>With improved understanding, newer treatment strategies are being developed often in combination with the established therapies. These strategies commonly incorporate drugs which modulate urinary bladder function, with an ever widening spectrum of drugs from different pharmacological classes being tested for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis as monotherapy or combination therapy.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-11 00:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is common in children. It has a significant negative impact on the child's psychosocial wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>). Currently, bedwetting alarms and desmopressin therapy are the established treatment for nocturnal enuresis, albeit with a subgroup of patients who do not respond. Although drug therapies other than desmopressin or tricyclics have been tried for nocturnal enuresis, little is known of their impact.</P>
<P>This review summarises the findings of the trials of all such medications (drugs other than desmopressin or tricyclics) used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. This review and its subsequent updates will play an important role in streamlining therapy, particularly of the children with refractory nocturnal enuresis. The findings of this review will also lay foundations for further research into the application of drugs to maximise the treatment outcomes in all types of children with nocturnal enuresis.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Participants, their parents, the healthcare professional looking after the child and the investigator conducting the data analysis are potential sources of bias. In assessing performance bias, blinding of the participants, their parents and the healthcare professionals is important. Blinding of participants and parents is usually clearly reported in the majority of trials comparing one drug with another or comparing a drug with placebo. However, in trials of drugs versus behavioural therapy blinding of participants and parents is usually not possible.</P>
<P>In assessing detection bias, blinding of the outcome assessors and data analysts needs to be considered. The outcome assessors in the study are usually the parents (who determine whether the child is dry or not). As mentioned previously, they are usually blinded in drug-drug and drug-placebo studies. Blinding of data analysts, however, is usually not mentioned. Overall, the blinding strategies for the trials included in this review were unsatisfactory.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Organic causes and daytime wetting</HEADING>
<P>In this update, we have chosen to include trials with participants who had daytime wetting as long as the trials were focused (partially or wholly) on nocturnal enuresis. In 26 trials, there was no specific mention of daytime symptoms in trial participants, while 15 trials specifically excluded children with daytime wetting. All trials included in the review had excluded children with organic diseases other than daytime wetting presumably due to functional bladder dysfunction. In one trial some children had an attention-deficit or hyperactivity disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Sumner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sumner 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>During treatment, only the combination of oxybutynin with a tricyclic drug was better than the tricyclic alone (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92, <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>.3; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparisons with placebo</HEADING>
<P>Only five of the drugs were superior to placebo (indomethacin, diclofenac, diazepam, mestorolone and atomoxetine) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; Figure 3) during treatment, both in terms of fewer wet nights and less not achieving 14 consecutive dry nights; but none of the reported drugs were effective in reducing the relapse rates when the treatment was withdrawn (<LINK REF="STD-Dubow-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Dubow 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-el_x002d_Sadr-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">el-Sadr 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tahmaz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tahmaz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2008</LINK>). In the remaining drug comparisons with placebo the numbers were too small to draw reliable conclusions and none of the drugs, except oxybutynin, are currently used in practice for children with enuresis. Most practitioners would be reluctant to prescribe major psychoactive drugs (for example chlordiazepoxide, amphetamine and diazepam) for children when alternative, effective treatments with fewer adverse effects are available. At present, the mechanisms behind the effect of psychoactive drugs in children with nocturnal enuresis are uncertain.</P>
<P>Two interesting trials (<LINK REF="STD-Austin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Austin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neveus-2008_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Neveus 2008#</LINK>) included children who did not respond to primary therapy for enuresis. Both these trials used tolterodine, a newer anticholinergic medication. When combined with desmopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Austin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Austin 2008</LINK>) it did not yield any additional benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparisons with other drugs</HEADING>
<P>Desmopressin was better than for indomethacin (WMD for wet nights during treatment 1.45, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.37) (<LINK REF="STD-Sener-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sener 1998</LINK>); and diclofenac (RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights 1.94, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.33) (<LINK REF="STD-Natochin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Natochin 2000</LINK>) suggesting that indomethacin and diclofenac would not be appropriate treatments for children with enuresis. Today, neither is in fact prescribed for this indication.</P>
<P>Similarly the results for imipramine were better than those for meprobamate, ephedrine, furosemide and emepronium, but again there was no information after stopping the drugs. These drugs are also not used in current practice for children with enuresis.</P>
<P>The results of combining oxybutynin with imipramine appear to be encouraging. The combination out-performs imipramine monotherapy in achieving short term as well as long term success (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>.14; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The reasons behind this findings could be attributed to some of the children having 'unreported' non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis that is associated with daytime lower urinary tract symptoms. This may provide a useful lead in designing future trials which incorporate children, especially those with non-monosymptomatic enuresis.</P>
<P>Only seven studies provided data on the relapse rates when the drug was withdrawn (<LINK REF="STD-Dubow-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Dubow 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-el_x002d_Sadr-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">el-Sadr 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmaeili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Esmaeili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingle-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Ingle 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tahmaz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tahmaz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2008</LINK>). Apart from the combination therapy with anticholinergics reported above, no other drug was effective in reducing the relapse rates when the treatment was withdrawn.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparisons with behavioural treatments</HEADING>
<P>There was little reliable information about drugs compared with behavioural treatments except that enuresis alarm therapy was better than amphetamine during treatment. No trials presented data describing results after stopping treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Of the drugs which were more effective than placebo (indomethacin, diclofenac and diazepam), adverse effects were reported for indomethacin, diazepam, atomoxetine and possibly for diclofenac, which was used in combination with imipramine.</P>
<P>In summary, desmopressin, tricyclics and enuresis alarm therapy were better than any of the drugs with which they were compared in this review, but the trials were all small or did not provide follow-up data and therefore it is uncertain whether treatment response was sustained. There was not enough evidence to suggest that any of the other drugs tested were effective or suitable for children. The lack of evidence for the effectiveness of the drugs tested needs to be viewed in the context of better long term results using other interventions. Further trials comparing drugs with each other (specifically desmopressin, which seems to be as effective as tricyclics but with fewer adverse effects) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>) and in combination therapy with effective behavioural interventions such as alarms (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005a</LINK>) would be helpful in determining the place of pharmacotherapy for children with enuresis.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-15 08:41:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified a large number of studies which tested a variety of drugs as primary therapy for nocturnal enuresis. More than 30 classes of drugs have been tested, none with any success. The review involves over 2300 participants, albeit spread out over a large number of small trials. This may weaken any strength of recommendations the authors are able to make.</P>
<P>It is apparent that most drugs that have been tested have side effects and poor efficacy. The only exception to this rule appears to be anticholinergic drugs when used in conjunction with established treatments like imipramine. They appear to improve the short term efficacy as well as reduce the relapse rates. This finding provides only limited support for their ongoing use in practice as it needs to be tested in further research before being adopted into clinical practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-10-11 13:18:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 40 trials (including 12 crossover trials) which were included in this updated review were mostly small and of poor quality. The average number of children per trial (62) was lower than in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Mallett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallett 2002</LINK>). The small sample sizes resulted in wide confidence intervals and imprecision which could obscure or over estimate underlying treatment effects. None of the trials satisfied all of the quality criteria. The trials appeared to be especially weak in the randomisation of participants and in blinding the outcome assessor (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). In most of the manuscripts, these aspects were not covered in adequate details leading to uncertainty. The majority of the trials had very low attrition; this could be partly due to their small sample size. There were only four trials which had adequate randomisation, and eight which had adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Most of the comparisons were addressed only in single trials, precluding meta-analysis. Only three drugs were tested in more than one trial (indomethacin suppository versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Waili-1989_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Waili 1989#</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sener-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sener 1998</LINK>); and diclofenac versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Waili-1986_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Waili 1986#</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Batislam-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Batislam 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natochin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Natochin 2000</LINK>) and oxybutynin (<LINK REF="STD-Esmaeili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Esmaeili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tahmaz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tahmaz 2000</LINK>). Two each of these trials were of crossover design (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Waili-1986_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Waili 1986#</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Waili-1989_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Waili 1989#</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials recruited children from enuresis clinics or hospitals; only seven included some or all children from the community, and only two were amongst institutionalised children or those with special needs. One trial was clearly industry funded (<LINK REF="STD-Sumner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sumner 2006</LINK>) and reported methodological problems such as baseline differences between the groups.</P>
<P>The ICCS defined continued success as no relapse after six months and cure as no relapse two years after withdrawing treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Insufficient follow-up data in the trials affects the strengths of recommendations of this review. Only 13 trials have reported any follow-up data, of which only four have a follow up of six months or more, the longest being 13 months.</P>
<P>Other potential biases included inadequate baseline information about participants, especially on the severity of bedwetting (13 trials). With the recognition by ICCS of the two forms of nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>), treatment response to drugs other than desmopressin and tricyclics may vary. The majority of the trials (26) were ambiguous regarding the presence or absence of daytime wetting or other daytime urinary symptoms in their participants. Ten trials specifically excluded children with daytime wetting.</P>

<P>Despite best efforts, some published literature may have been missed. The quality assessment was based on the published manuscripts. This may have unintentionally downgraded the perceived quality of blinding and allocation concealment. Given the absence of trial registration for most of the trials included in this review, bias due to selective reporting of outcomes was difficult to ascertain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-09-10 21:29:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting permanently. There was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin, imipramine and enuresis alarm therapy were better than the drugs to which they were compared. In other reviews, desmopressin, tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective. There was also weak evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy might increase the efficacy of tricyclics.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:51:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research on alternative drugs for enuresis must incorporate comparisons with proven effective treatments such as desmopressin and tricyclic drugs; alarms; or other behavioural interventions such as lifting, waking and reward systems. Placebo controlled drug trials without incorporating established therapies should be discouraged when proven effective therapies are available. The role of anticholinergics as a supplementary therapy in nocturnal enuresis should be studied further.</P>
<P>The trials should make conscious efforts to adopt the nomenclature guidelines prescribed by the ICCS. Children with nocturnal enuresis should be included irrespective of whether they have monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, which will increase the broad applicability of results. Subgroup analysis of monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic groups may provide further knowledge about the drug effectiveness.</P>
<P>Trials need to be of a larger size to minimise imprecision. Trials need to report on follow-up data, as prescribed by the ICCS. A minimum follow-up of six months should be factored into the trials in order to give some estimate to success and cure in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). They should use uniform outcome measures such as the number of wet nights during treatment and after the end of treatment; the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights; adverse effects; and relapse rates after treatment. Trialists should ensure that the methodological quality of the trials is high in order to minimise bias.</P>
<P>Further research is needed to determine which interventions are appropriate for which groups and in which circumstances (for example as a short term measure to cover nights away from home) in order to guide choice of treatment.</P>

<P>The protocol included trials which investigated drugs other than desmopressin and tricyclics for nocturnal enuresis in children. A large variety of drugs have been studied across many pharmacological groups.The authors have deviated from the protocol on the issue of dealing with trials which include children with daytime wetting or other lower urinary tract symptoms. Following the guidelines drafted by the ICCS, we have now treated nocturnal enuresis with daytime symptoms as non-monosymptomatic enuresis and have hence included these trials in the review as long as they focused on outcomes relevant to this review. A subgroup analysis investigating the efficacy of combination therapy with anticholinergics compared to monotherapy was undertaken (Comparison 5). </P>
