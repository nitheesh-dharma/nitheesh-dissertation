<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>The evidence from published randomised controlled trials is inadequate to establish the effectiveness of any drug for treating facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. More research is needed</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle disease. Muscle weakness is often relatively mild and progression slow but around one fifth of affected people eventually become wheelchair-bound. The muscles of the face, shoulder blades and upper arms are most severely effected, but weakness occurs in other muscles. There is no agreed treatment. Only two randomised controlled trials have been published. One small trial of albuterol (also known as salbutamol)and another small trial of creatine (a dietary supplement for building muscle) were inadequate to confirm or refute a significant effect. Further trials of albuterol, creatine and other agents are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle disease which has no agreed treatment. Early suggestions that corticosteroids might be helpful were not supported by a subsequent open label study. The beta 2 adrenergic agonist albuterol, also known as salbutamol, is known to have anabolic effects which might be beneficial for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Creatine has been used as a muscle performance enhancer by athletes and it might be helpful in muscular dystrophies including facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>
<BR/>The objective of the review was to determine whether there is any drug treatment which alters the progression of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised register (searched August 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) and EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003) for any references to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Abstracts from the major neurological meetings and trial bibliographies were also searched for further references to trials. Experts were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials or trials in progress.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised or quasi-randomised trials of any drug treatment for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, in adults with a recognised diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Trials had to include an assessment of muscle strength at one year. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All identified trials were independently assessed by both reviewers to ensure that they fulfilled the selection criteria and were then rated for their quality. Trial data were extracted and entered by one reviewer and checked by the other. If appropriate data existed a weighted treatment effect was to be calculated across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager. The results were to have been expressed as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and risk differences and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two published high quality randomised controlled trials fulfilled the selection criteria. One compared creatine supplementation with placebo and the other compared high and low-dose albuterol with placebo. A further unpublished randomised controlled trial of albuterol in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy was identified. The creatine trial showed a non-significant difference in favour of creatine. The albuterol trial showed no significant difference in muscle strength at one year but some secondary measures such as lean body mass and handgrip strength did improve.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support any drug treatment for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy but only two randomised controlled trials have been published. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-31 20:30:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a characteristic, initially regional, pattern of involvement. It is the third most common form of muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1:20,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Padberg-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padberg 1982</LINK>). Although muscle weakness in FSHD is often relatively mild and progression slow, about 20% of affected individuals eventually become wheelchair-bound (<LINK REF="REF-Padberg-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padberg 1982</LINK>). The pathophysiology of FSHD remains unknown and despite genetic localization of FSHD to chromosome 4q35 and clear identification of the molecular lesion, neither the causative gene(s) nor its protein product is known (<LINK REF="REF-Tawil-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tawil 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no known effective treatment for FSHD. Early case reports suggested a role for corticosteroids in FSHD. The use of corticosteroids in FSHD was prompted by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in a significant proportion of FSHD muscle biopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Arahata-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arahata 1995</LINK>). Munsat et al. reported improvement in strength and a reduction in serum creatine kinase levels in three of four patients with FSHD (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1972</LINK>). The report, however, provides details of dosage and duration of treatment in only two patients and the reported changes in muscle strength were not quantified (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1972</LINK>). Moreover, in a follow-up report, all the treated patients eventually continued to progress (<LINK REF="REF-Munsat-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munsat 1977</LINK>). Following this report it became common practice to treat FSHD patients having inflammatory infiltrates on their muscle biopsy, at least transiently, with corticosteroids. Interest in corticosteroid treatment for dystrophies including FSHD was heightened with the demonstration of its efficacy in Duchenne dystrophy. In 1997, the results of a prospective, 12 week, open label uncontrolled trial of prednisone in FSHD were published (<LINK REF="REF-Tawil-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tawil 1997</LINK>). Eight patients with FSHD were enrolled and received 1.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone (maximum 80 mg/day). The primary outcome of efficacy was change in mean manual muscle testing scores. Secondary outcomes included change in mean standardized isometric myometry scores, change in lean body mass as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and change in muscle mass as estimated by urinary creatinine excretion. There was no significant improvement in strength measures or surrogate measures of muscle function after 12 weeks of treatment. Based on this study, there appears to be no role for the use of short-term corticosteroids to improve strength in FSHD. The study did not have sufficient power to address the question of whether long-term corticosteroids can slow disease progression.</P>
<P>Promising results of a pilot trial of albuterol in FSHD suggested that this might be a useful treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kissel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissel 1998</LINK>). Albuterol (known as salbutamol in the UK) is a beta-2 receptor agonist. This class of drugs has muscle anabolic effects in several animal models of muscle wasting as well as in normal humans in the setting of disuse atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Kissel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissel 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Creatine might be another potentially useful treatment for muscular dystrophies including FSHD. It is a guanidino compound that is found in meat containing products, and is produced in the body, mainly by the liver but also by the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Guthmiller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthmiller 1994</LINK>). Creatine plays an important role in muscle energy metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Wallimann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallimann 1992</LINK>) and may play a role in the regulation of protein metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Parise-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parise 2001</LINK>). Patients with neuromuscular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Park-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 1999</LINK>) have lower skeletal muscle creatine levels thus giving the potential for creatine monohydrate supplementation to enhance muscle performance. Indeed healthy adults taking creatine supplements have shown improved muscle force (<LINK REF="REF-Greenhaff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhaff 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maganaris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maganaris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarnopolsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnopolsky 2000</LINK>) and increased lean body mass (most of which is muscle) (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hultman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hultman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihic 2000</LINK>). </P>

<P>See: Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Search Strategy. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised trials register (searched August 2003) using facioscapulohumeral dystrophy as the search term. A similar search strategy was applied to MEDLINE (from January 1966 to August 2003) and EMBASE (from January 1980 to August 2003). Conference abstracts including those of the American Academy of Neurology, the International Conference on Neuromuscular Diseases, the World Muscle Society and the European Neurological Society were scanned for relevant studies. We checked the bibliographies in reports of the randomised trials and contacted their authors and other experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. </P>

<P>As there were only two RCTs available which compared different interventions, no meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis was appropriate. However when full data from an unpublished trial using albuterol become available (<LINK REF="STD-Padberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Padberg 2004</LINK>) such analysis may be possible for the albuterol intervention.</P>
<P>The creatine trial published data (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>) pooled the results of 32 patients with a variety of muscular dystrophies. The authors kindly allowed us access to their original data thus enabling us to analyse the data relevant to the 12 participants with FSHD. Although this trial was only of eight weeks duration and therefore did not include any of the outcome criteria for this review we nevertheless present the results. As it was a crossover study we have analysed the results as if for a parallel study, thus counting each participant twice (once on creatine and again on placebo). The trial was negative for FSHD participants in that the difference in the MRC scores during creatine (a mean decline of -0.31%) and during placebo (mean decline of -2.64%) was not significant. Likewise the changes in the neuromuscular symptoms score during creatine treatment (mean 9.01%) compared with placebo (mean -0.49%) was not significant.</P>

<P>This was well tolerated with no serious adverse effects reported. Subjects on high dose albuterol had a significantly higher heart rate than seen in the placebo group but without any clinical effect. Most subjects had only mild side effects that were just as frequently seen in the placebo as in the treated groups see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Moderate to severe side effects tended to occur early and to diminish with time. Incremental dosing was delayed in 4/90 subjects (two on placebo), temporarily suspended in 7/90 (three on placebo) or curtailed, but continued at lower dose in 7/90 (two on placebo). One subject in the high dose albuterol group dropped out after three months due to side effects which included tremor, headache and shakiness (<LINK REF="STD-Kissel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kissel 2001</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Albuterol</HEADING>
<P>The authors of the albuterol trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kissel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kissel 2001</LINK>) point out that although there was no increase in strength nor improvement in function as a result of taking albuterol there were significant increases in lean body mass and handgrip strength suggesting that albuterol was having some anabolic effect. The sustained improvement in handgrip strength but not in the other muscles tested might suggest that benefit was more likely to be seen in distal rather than proximal muscles, either because proximal, and especially axial muscles, may have been too weak to benefit, or because albuterol preferentially affects distal versus proximal muscles, if there was differential expression of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The increased lean body mass seen with albuterol may not have translated to increased muscle strength because the average increase of 1.5 kg may not have been sufficient to produce a detectable change in strength, particularly as some of the increase may have been in the non-muscle tissues that contribute to as much as 30% of lean body mass. The authors suggested that a greater benefit from albuterol might be achieved either by combining albuterol with other anabolic agents or instituting a regime of exercise together with the albuterol. A further suggestion for increasing the possible benefit from albuterol was to "pulse" the treatment because intermittent treatment might prevent the de-sensitisation or down-regulation of beta 2 adrenergic receptors seen in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 1987</LINK>). Such receptor de-sensitisation may explain why in this trial there was a (non-significant) trend to improvement in MVIC and MMT at three months which then declined.</P>
<P>We will combine the data from the unpublished trial when they become available.</P>
<P>Side effects of the beta 2 agonists such as albuterol include fine tremor (particularly in the hands), nervous tension, headache, peripheral dilatation and palpitations (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2003</LINK>). Other side effect include tachycardia and arrhythmias and disturbances of sleep and behaviour in children. Muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions including paradoxical bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema have also been reported. Beta 2 agonists are associated with hypokalaemia after high doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Creatine</HEADING>
<P>The creatine trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 2000</LINK>) did show a small but significant improvement of 3% in muscle strength (MRC) and 10% in daily life activities when all 32 subjects with various muscular dystrophies were analysed together. The sub-group with FSHD would have been too small a sample to show anything other than a large treatment effect. The authors called for further studies of creatine for muscular dystrophies generally. A larger or longer trial of creatine might show more conclusively whether or not creatine is a worthwhile treatment for FSHD.</P>
<P>Creatine may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. In rare cases it may cause renal failure, mostly in those with impaired renal function. Muscle cramps have been reported but this may relate to its use when taken by dehydrated athletes (<LINK REF="REF-Natural-Med-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natural Med 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future trial methodology</HEADING>
<P>The two RCTs that have been published were high quality trials with methodology (in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures) that would be a good model for the design of future trials. Additional outcome measures that should be considered in future trials would include quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Therapies for future trials </HEADING>
<P>There are a number of treatment options that could be studied in future trials including, but not limited to, pulsed albuterol, other anabolic agents, combinations of anabolic agents and anabolic agents in combination with exercise. The effects of exercise and muscle strength training in muscle disease including FSHD are the subject of an ongoing Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Kooi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Kooi 2003</LINK>). The negative results of the open label uncontrolled trial of corticosteroids for FSHD (<LINK REF="REF-Tawil-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tawil 1997</LINK>), together with the appreciation that the inflammatory pathology seen in some muscle biopsies of FSHD patients is unlikely to be a primary pathology, do not encourage an RCT of corticosteroids for FSHD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>One small trial of albuterol and another small trial of creatine were inadequate to confirm or refute a significant effect of FSHD. Other agents have not been subjected to randomised trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further trials of albuterol, creatine and other agents in FSHD.</P>

Since prednisone improves strength in Duchenne dystrophy, we performed a pilot, open-label trial of prednisone in eight subjects fulfilling strict diagnostic criteria for FSHD. Prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day; maximum 80 mg/day) was administered for 12 weeks. Manual muscle testing, maximum voluntary isometric contraction testing, and muscle mass estimations by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and urinary creatinine excretion were performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. There were no significant changes in strength or muscle mass. We conclude that prednisone given for 12 weeks does not produce major improvement in strength or increase muscle mass in FSHD. The study did not have sufficient power or length of follow- up to address the possibility that prednisone might arrest or slow disease progression&lt;/p&gt;" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
