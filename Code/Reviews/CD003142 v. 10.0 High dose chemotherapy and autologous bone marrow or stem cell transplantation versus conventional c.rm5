<TITLE>High dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation versus conventional chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-12 12:59:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advanced or 'metastatic' breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast and underarm lymph nodes to other parts of the body. Although metastatic breast cancer is often responsive to conventional chemotherapy it does not provide a cure. The dose of chemotherapy that can be given to an individual is limited because it is unsafe in high doses and can seriously damage the bone marrow, creating high risk of serious infection. One treatment that was considered promising at the start of the 1990's was use of autograft, which involves transplantation of a woman's own bone marrow or peripheral stem cells to regenerate her bone marrow. Autografting allowed the administration of chemotherapy doses many times higher than could otherwise be used. This systematic review aimed to compare the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing high dose chemotherapy with conventional chemotherapy.</P>
<P>This review identified six randomised trials including 437 women receiving high dose chemotherapy with autograft and 413 women receiving conventional chemotherapy treatment. In the group receiving the high dose chemotherapy, there were 15 treatment-related deaths as opposed to two in the conventional chemotherapy arm. Although the high-dose treatment did not increase overall survival at 5 years compared with conventional treatment, women on the high-dose treatment survived significantly longer before experiencing recurrence of cancer. Treatment side-effects were worse in the high-dose group. On the basis of this review, the authors conclude that high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplantation should not be given to women with metastatic breast cancer outside of clinical trials.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:14:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although metastatic breast cancer is often responsive to conventional chemotherapy, it remains ultimately incurable. Autologous transplantation of bone marrow or peripheral stem cells (in which the patient is both donor and recipient) has been considered a promising technique because it allows much higher doses of chemotherapy to be used.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (autograft) with conventional chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer. Outcomes were survival rates, treatment-related toxicity and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-12 12:35:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group search strategy, adding these terms: bone marrow transplantation, stem cell transplantation, autologous stem cell support. The following databases were searched up to August 2010: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology). We also searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group database and trial registries for unpublished trials, and checked the reference lists of articles found.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of high dose chemotherapy and autograft with conventional chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Six randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-12 12:39:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total 437 eligible women were randomised to receive high dose chemotherapy with autograft and 413 were randomised to receive conventional treatment. There were fifteen treatment-related deaths among the high dose group and two in the control (conventional dose) group (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.40 to 11.93). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the high dose and control groups at three years or five years. At five years of follow up, there was a statistically significant difference in event-free survival, favouring the high dose group (RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.50). Toxicity was more severe in the high dose group. Only one of the trials has followed up all women for five years.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:14:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Although there is evidence that high dose chemotherapy and autograft significantly improves event-free survival compared to conventional chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer there is no significant evidence of benefit in overall survival. High dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplantation should not be given to women with metastatic breast cancer outside of clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:16:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-12 12:47:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women and is the primary cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in most countries and although survival rates have improved in Europe and North America this improvement relates mainly to disease diagnosed at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2004</LINK>). Advanced or 'metastatic' breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast and underarm lymph nodes to other parts of the body. Although metastatic breast cancer is often responsive to conventional chemotherapy or endocrine (hormonal) treatments it remains ultimately incurable (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:14:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Researchers from the 1970s onwards described a dose-response relationship in the action of chemotherapy drugs against cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Frei-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frei 1980</LINK>); thus it has been observed that in the treatment of breast cancer the percentage of women responding to therapy is positively associated with the dose intensity of the drugs received, dose intensity being a function of both the dose and the timing of the chemotherapy regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hryniuk-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hryniuk 1984</LINK>). The technique of bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation using the patient's own tissue (a treatment known as autograft) was considered an exciting development because it addressed the problem of life-threatening bone-marrow toxicity which had previously limited the dose of chemotherapy drugs that could be safely given.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:15:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The use of autograft with chemotherapy permits the administration of chemotherapy doses many times higher than could otherwise be used. Results of animal studies were encouraging, as were non-randomised patient trials. During the 1980s and 1990s several non-randomised patient trials reported prolonged survival times using high dose chemotherapy and autograft for women with advanced breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1992;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Peters-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1988;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:16:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Since clinical trials started, a large number of women with breast cancer have been treated with high dose chemotherapy and autograft and in the 1990s over 41,000 people in the United States underwent the procedure. However there is scant clinical evidence of its efficacy, with evidence from non-randomised studies being criticised for participant selection bias as well as other design weaknesses (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mello-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mello 2001</LINK>). The first randomised trials, sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, began in 1991. Several randomised controlled trials have now been completed and the aim of this review is to consider them.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:38:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The most complete data set feasible was assembled. The data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original investigators. Some studies had multiple publications and reported outcomes at differing follow-up times. The data included in this review are the most mature results available for each study. Most of the available data were immature (e.g. five year outcomes were estimated when not all participants had been randomised for five years). Where triallists reported survival rates based on immature data, these rates were used in our tables of comparison. A note has been made in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> where applicable. Where results were available only as percentages or only presented in graphs, the numerators and denominators were back-calculated from the data available and the tables of comparison completed accordingly.

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-10-12 13:05:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the difficulty in detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the authors aimed to minimise their potential impact by<BR/>ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data. It was planned that if there were ten or more studies in an analysis, a funnel plot would be used to explore the possibility of small study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-12-09 09:39:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Where trials appeared to be clinically comparable, data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel method for fixed effects.

Interpretation of a given degree of heterogeneity will differ according to whether the estimates show the same direction of effect but it was planned to tentatively assign adjectives of low, moderate and high heterogeneity to I<SUP>2 </SUP>values of 0% to 25%, 26% to 74% and 75% to100% respectively.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial Design</HEADING>
<P>All six trials were randomised and compared high dose treatment to conventionally-dosed chemotherapy. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2005</LINK>) stated that cross-over to high dose chemotherapy was pre-planned for patients in the control group with disease progression. One (<LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>) stated that treatment at disease progression would be decided by the treating physician: this could include high dose chemotherapy and autograft for women on the control arm. The other trials did not state a plan for those in the control group with disease progression. One study (<LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK>) stated that maintenance chemotherapy could be used for the control arm at the discretion of the trial investigator.</P>
<P>All the trials were multi-centred. Two were conducted in France (<LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-04-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 04 1999</LINK>), one in the United States (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK>) and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK>). Two trials were international, one with centres in Ireland, the UK, Switzerland, Spain and Greece (<LINK REF="STD-IBDIS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IBDIS 2003</LINK>) and one with centres in Germany and Austria (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>Five studies provided power calculations: <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK> was designed at baseline in 1991 to have a power of 90% to detect a doubling of median survival with high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplant. This required 348 women to be randomised. As recruitment problems were encountered, the design was revised in 1996 and new power calculations were given using 85% power with 164 women required to be randomised. Eventually 188 women were randomised. <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK> was powered to have 80% power to detect an 18% difference in survival at 2 years. <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK> was powered to detect a 20% improvement in event-free survival at three years and 180 women were required to be randomised. <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-04-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 04 1999</LINK> was powered to detect a 25% improvement in event-free survival at two years, with 156 women required to be randomised. Only 61 women were eventually randomised because of recruitment problems. <LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2005</LINK> failed to meet accrual targets and was terminated early, thus the planned two-part statistical design was abandoned and exploratory data analyses only were applied</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Five trials administered initial conventionally-dosed chemotherapy before starting high dose treatment (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>). In four of these trials all participants had to demonstrate complete or partial response to chemotherapy before randomisation, while in the fifth (<LINK REF="STD-IBDIS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IBDIS 2003</LINK>) participants were randomised before chemotherapy commenced but only participants responding to initial chemotherapy proceeded to the high dose treatment. The rate of complete response to initial chemotherapy varied between 6% and 24%. In four studies, both groups received the same initial chemotherapy and the control group had additional conventionally-dosed chemotherapy, while in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>) the control group had no further chemotherapy after randomisation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2005</LINK>) compared 'upfront' high dose chemotherapy (with no induction course) with conventional chemotherapy.</P>
<P>In all trials high dose chemotherapy was administered with blood progenitor cell support and all trials stated that GCSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) was used to stimulate mobilisation of stem cells from the bone marrow. Women on both arms of the trial received GCSF in one study (<LINK REF="STD-IBDIS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">IBDIS 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>All trials stated that they were randomised controlled trials with women randomised to either high-dose chemotherapy or to a control group that received conventional dose chemotherapy. Four trials used stratification.

The <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK> triallists commented that the numerous stratification factors in this trial resulted in skewed assignment to high-dose and conventional-dose chemotherapy groups, with unequal numbers in the two groups. In <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK>, participants were stratified by response to and type of induction chemotherapy, disease site and hormone receptor status.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-09 10:25:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The results of this review show a statistically significant advantage in event-free survival for women with metastatic breast cancer receiving high dose chemotherapy. There is also evidence of a longer median time to tumour progression in the high dose group. Moreover although no statistically significant benefit in overall survival has been demonstrated, there is a non-significant trend towards improved overall survival in the high-dose group (at five years: RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.34). This finding was not evident in the first version of this review, possibly because any benefits for high dose treatment were overshadowed by significantly higher treatment-related mortality in the high dose arm.</P>
<P>There are several issues making it essential to interpret these results with extreme caution. It would take only one event in the high-dose group at five years to negate the statistically significant effect for event-free survival at this time point, and the effect is also nullified by the use of a random-effect statistical model. Further data are required as none of the analyses for survival involve more than 355 women. At present the follow up of most of the studies is incomplete and one has not been published. Moreover four studies mention that some participants from the control group had treatment with high dose chemotherapy and autograft at relapse (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-03-2002" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 03 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schmid-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schmid 2005</LINK>), making it more difficult to compare the progress of the two groups. There is moderate heterogeneity in the results for event-free survival at three years, which is probably attributable to there being only two trials in this comparison. Heterogeneity is low or absent for other outcomes.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-PEGASE-04-1999" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASE 04 1999</LINK>, who reported positive results for high dose treatment, commented that it would be inappropriate to conclude from their findings that high dose chemotherapy has a real impact on overall survival. They pointed out a number of limitations in their study, notably a higher prevalence in the high dose group of pulmonary lesions (which are more chemosensitive than other visceral lesions) and a difference in the total duration of chemotherapy received due to the failure of 17/29 women in the control group to receive post-randomisation maintenance chemotherapy as planned. They noted that there was probably selection bias in the trial, with oncologists referring only women who would be expected to be good candidates for high dose treatment and this may limit the generalisability of results. In addition they speculated whether the superior results in the high dose arm might relate to hormone deprivation, as all women in the high dose arm became postmenopausal whereas many remained premenopausal in the control arm.</P>
<P>Some researchers have suggested that while the studies have not demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in long term survival from high dose chemotherapy, a particular subgroup may be shown to benefit. This possibility was investigated by <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK> investigators. <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-2001" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC 2001</LINK> investigators looked specifically at the following factors: type of induction chemotherapy, level of response to induction, whether adjuvant chemotherapy was used and the presence or absence of visceral disease. However no benefit was shown for any subgroup. <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 2000</LINK> investigators looked at level of response to induction, age, oestrogen receptor status and site of metastatic disease. The only statistically significant interaction observed between treatment and subgroup was for age. They reported a 28% lower hazard of death for women aged over 43 and assigned to conventional treatment, and a 33% higher hazard of dying for women aged 42 or less and assigned conventional chemotherapy. The number of women in these subgroups was small: there were a total of 61 women aged 42 years or less and 123 women aged 43 to 61 years.</P>
<P>High dose chemotherapy with autograft is associated with a significant risk of treatment-related death, a high incidence of serious acute side effects and severely diminished quality of life following treatment. Although most of these effects are short term and quality of life gradually improves, women still report significant impairment six to nine months later. However in the 1990s high dose therapy was often viewed as worthwhile for women with high risk or advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nieto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto 2000</LINK>). As a result many women in the USA have been treated outside of a clinical trial: data from the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry suggest that in the USA during the 1990s over 40,000 women with breast cancer received this treatment though fewer than 1000 were recruited to clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-ABMTR-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABMTR 2002</LINK>). This review underscores the importance of randomised controlled trials to provide reliable evidence about effective treatments for women with metastatic breast cancer.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-12 14:00:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of high dose chemotherapy with autograft for women with metastatic breast cancer. There is some evidence that this treatment prolongs disease-free survival but no statistically significant evidence that it prolongs overall survival. Moreover high dose chemotherapy with autograft is associated with considerable morbidity and a significant risk of treatment-related mortality. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-12 14:00:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplantation should not be given to women with metastatic breast cancer outside of clinical trials. It seems unlikely that further studies are warranted unless more compelling evidence emerges of a beneficial effect, or until there are further encouraging technical or scientific developments.</P>
