Will do this shortly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W notes 21/01/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for completing this update draft. I have made some edits for style and language. I left the changes in as tracked changes so you can see them. Once you have read through all the changes, you can accept all the changes in one go by clicking on Edit &amp;gt; global replace... &amp;gt; then ticking the box 'globally accept tracked changes' in the pop-up. I have the following comments which I would be grateful if you could attend to before this review update is ready for another editor. It would be very helpful if you could make a brief note here to explain what changes you made or if you disagreed with something I said and why. Hope this is helpful for you. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract and plain language summary &lt;/b&gt;- these need to be expanded. I can help you do this once you have responded to the points below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;included studies&lt;/b&gt; - added sentence to explain why you included studies with children in - is this the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of bias&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;blinding of outcome assessors - there are two sentences which look redundant. Can you check if you are happy for the to be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other bias - I'm wondering how you distinguished that 3 studies had no other risk of bias and the others were unclear. What was the difference? How can you be sure?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risk of bias tables were constructed per outcome in several domains. It is fine to split risk of bias domains into outcome groups. The most common way this is done in Cochrane reviews is by splitting into subjective and objective outcomes - where there may be a different impact on the outcome measure depending on the methodological quality of the study. e.g. blinding is likely to have an impact on subjective quality of life, but is not going to have an impact on deaths. In the case of your review however, there was insufficient data reported to make splitting outcomes in this way worthwhile. I have therefore removed the extra lines form the table. Please could you check that you are happy with the text and judgements in the risk of bias tables and that I have not introduced an error in transcribing the information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added 'inactive' to highlight that the control received no intervention in the heading in the results section. Is this OK? If so, we should make the change to the data and analysis section as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;my understanding was that there were Buteyko trials - I added a sentence into the discussion to explain this gap in the review - OK?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once patients have signed informed consent, it is clear whether they are receiving the treatment or not.- is that true??? If this were the case, then no clinical trials would be blinded. Please rephrase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews &amp;#160;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand what this sentence means. &amp;quot;M&lt;span&gt;oreover, there are two other available trials that could not be included in this review which involved breathing exercises techniques that were comprised by the included studies (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Sabina 2005&quot;&gt;Sabina 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Slader 2006&quot;&gt;Slader 2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&amp;quot; can you explain it better and why you chose to highlight this particular excluded study here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think there is too much repetition form the results section here. You should limit this section to an overall summary of how your review compared and contrasted with the other published systematic reviews. The last paragraph in this section is good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sources of support&lt;/b&gt; - please list any sources of support e.g. financial or your institution(s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt; - please run the validation report (go to file &amp;gt; reports &amp;gt; validation report). Some references need additional information such as the volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/b&gt; is missing. Do you need help to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;plain language summary - t&lt;/b&gt;his is too short and therefore needs work - let's wait until the SOF is in place and I can help you if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has finished working on the comments from the editorial base. The changes made are described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the new search 3 studies were included in the review. Changes were made according to new information from these studies. The conclusion did not change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The changes regarding style and language were accepted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The abstract and the plain language summary were expanded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sentence regarding the inclusion of all studies as the mean age was over 18 was added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sentences regarding blinding of outcome assessors were rephrased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In order to assess the item &amp;#8220;Other bias&amp;#8221; of The Cochrane Collaboration&amp;#8217;s tool for assessing risk of bias, the team has consulted the Handbook to check other possible sources of bias. According to this and by reading the potential limitations described by each study, the ones that reported limitations that were not considered as being another source of bias were classified as &amp;#8220;low risk of bias&amp;#8221;. The ones that did not provide sufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists were classified as &amp;#8220;unclear risk of bias&amp;#8221;. If we have not done this correctly, please let us know so we can make the necessary changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The changes regarding the risk of bias tables were made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The word 'inactive' was added to the control groups that received no intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the three new included studies performed Buteyko, so the sentence regarding this technique was removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sentence regarding the blinding of the participants was rephrased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews: the studies of Sabina 2005 and Slader 2006 were removed from this section. Moreover, this section was rephrased according to the comments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source of support:&lt;/b&gt; no source of support was provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The references of Vempati 2009 and Lum 1994 were changed. The other three (Aleksandrov 1990; Paleev 1988; Redchits 1986) could not be changed, as these were exclusions from previous versions of the review and we were not able to find them on databases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The summary of findings table was added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;14/06/2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes made according to comments from Anne Holland and Chris Cates are described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding Physiotherapy was rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentences in results and conclusions were rephrased. Changes were based on the abstract from the previous version of the review in order to make the main outcomes easier to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sentence was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentences regarding Physiotherapy, lower costs and risks of breathing exercises, &amp;#8216;quality of the evidence&amp;#8217; and meta-analysis were rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description of the condition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sentence was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding asthma symptoms and hyperventilation were rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 were rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence suggested was included in the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description of the intervention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grammatical error was corrected in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the intervention might work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentences regarding the Papworth Method, Buteyko and yoga were rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it is important to do this review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sentences were rephrased in order to avoid repeating information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grammatical errors were corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;METHODS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Types of participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grammatical error was corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data extraction and management &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sentence was rephrased to &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;standard data collection &lt;i&gt;form&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subgroup analysis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence was changed to past tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sensitivity analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &amp;#8216;poor quality&amp;#8217; the authors meant a study with an overall unclear risk or high risk of bias. We proposed to explore the influence of such studies on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the included studies could be pooled. However, a subgroup analysis was undertaken for the outcome &amp;#8216;change in AQLQ&amp;#8217; once the techniques involved are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breathing exercises versus inactive control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Asthma symptoms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies of Girodo 1992 and Vedanthan 1998 reported between-group analysis. However, the study of Prem 2012 did not. The sentences were rephrased for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Number of exacerbations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of Girodo 1992 reported between-group analysis. The sentences were rephrased for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Physiological measures &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding sample size was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breathing exercises versus asthma education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quality of life and asthma symptoms &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies of Thomas 2003 and Thomas 2009 reported between-group analysis and the sentences were rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Withdrawals and dropouts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the individual study details regarding withdrawals and dropouts are available in the &amp;#8216;Characteristics of included studies&amp;#8217;, this section was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of main results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph was rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quality of the evidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding the study of Moher 1994 was rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third paragraph was summarised in order to avoid repeating the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding double blinding was rephrased for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Potential biases in the review process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph was not rephrased. It was not clear for us which part should be changed. However, the authors are open to suggestions regarding this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last sentence was rephrased for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typo was corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence regarding the study of Ram 2003 was rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph of the &amp;#8216;Summary of main results&amp;#8216; was rephrased to describe the findings from individual trials regarding the benefits of breathing exercises in patients with asthma. However, we were not able to give reliable conclusions in the review due to methodological differences among the included studies and to poor reporting of methodological aspects in most of the included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors indicated which study arm was not included in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUMMARY OF FINDINGS TABLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some changes were made in &amp;#8216;quality of life&amp;#8217; due to changes in meta-analysis for this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;META-ANALYSIS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes requested were made. As the outcome &amp;#8216;change in AQLQ&amp;#8217; showed statistical difference favouring breathing exercises, some changes were also made in the text.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-10-01 09:27:26 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="BEX-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.6 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>Asthma is a lung disease, that comprises underlying inflammation and tightening of the small tubes in the airways (called <I>airway obstruction</I>), which occurs in response to asthma triggers such as animal danders or pollen (also called <I>bronchial hyperresponsiveness</I>). The high prevalence of asthma worldwide is a major public health problem because of the high healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation and medication. Breathing exercises are a non-pharmacological intervention that has been used routinely in the treatment of patients with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the hyperventilation symptoms of asthma and can be performed as the Papworth Method, the Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern.</P>

<P>We wanted to look at available evidence for the effectiveness of breathing exercises in adults with asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found 13 studies involving 906 adults with mild to moderate asthma. Eleven studies compared breathing exercises with inactive controls and two with asthma education control groups. Overall, improvements in quality of life, asthma symptoms and numbers of exacerbations were reported. Six of the eleven studies that assessed lung function showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises. No adverse effects related to the intervention were described, which indicates that this is a safe and well-tolerated intervention in people with asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The trials were different in terms of type of breathing exercises performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. As a result, we were not able to compare the results from these trials using a meta-analysis for all outcomes. Meta-analysis was possible for only two outcomes (asthma symptoms and change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire&#8212;AQLQ), each of which was reported in only two studies. Both meta-analyses showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises. The methods used to conduct these studies were not as well reported as we would have liked, and so the quality of the trials was unclear. Overall the quality of the evidence included in the review was very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no conclusive evidence in this review supports or refutes the efficacy of such intervention in the treatment of adult patients with asthma.</P>

<P>A total of 13 studies involving 906 participants are included in the review. The trials were different from one another in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. Asthma severity in participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, and the samples consisted solely of outpatients. The following outcomes were measured: quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of acute exacerbations and lung function. Eleven studies compared breathing exercise with inactive control, and two with asthma education control groups. All eight studies that assessed quality of life reported an improvement in this outcome. An improvement in the number of acute exacerbations was observed by the only study that assessed this outcome. Six of seven included studies showed significant differences favouring breathing exercises for asthma symptoms. Effects on lung function were more variable, with no difference reported in five of the eleven studies that assessed this outcome, while the other six showed a significant difference for this outcome, which favoured breathing exercises. As a result of substantial heterogeneity among the studies, meta-analysis was possible only for asthma symptoms and changes in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Each meta-analysis included only two studies and showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13 for asthma symptoms; MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08 for change in AQLQ). Assessment of risk of bias was impaired by incomplete reporting of methodological aspects of most of the included trials.</P>

<P>Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no reliable conclusions could be drawn concerning the use of breathing exercises for asthma in clinical practice.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:02:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that can lead to structural and functional changes, resulting in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holgate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holgate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brightling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brightling 2012</LINK>). Symptoms of asthma include recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness, together with episodes of marked worsening of symptoms, known as <I>exacerbations</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brightling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brightling 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of asthma is based on the individual's medical history, physical examination findings and lung function and laboratory test results (<LINK REF="REF-Sveum-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sveum 2012</LINK>). Measurement of lung function provides an assessment of the severity of airflow limitation. These measures yield complementary information about different aspects of asthma control and are obtained by spirometry and by peak expiratory flow measurement (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>). Assessment of airway responsiveness to factors that can cause asthma symptoms, evaluation of airway inflammation and measurement of allergic status may facilitate the diagnosis of patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma is a serious public health problem that is a major cause of disability and health resource utilisation for those affected (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-To-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">To 2012</LINK>). Around 300 million individuals of all ages worldwide are affected by asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brightling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brightling 2012</LINK>). Increases in morbidity, mortality and economic costs are associated with severe or difficult to treat asthma, particularly in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisner 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma has been associated with symptomatic hyperventilation, which decreases carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) levels, causing hypocapnia (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laffey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laffey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bruton-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruton 2005a</LINK>). Hypocapnia resulting from hyperventilation may perpetuate the bronchospasm and culminate in a cycle of progressive hypocapnia and increasing bronchospasm (<LINK REF="REF-Laffey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laffey 2002</LINK>). Thus, hypocapnia may contribute to increased airway resistance in patients with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Elshout-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Elshout 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laffey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laffey 2002</LINK>). This fact has led to increasing interest in strategies that can be used to reduce hyperventilation. In addition, psychological symptoms may interfere with the severity of the respiratory symptoms and may influence patients&#8217; quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Rimington-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimington 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juniper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 2004</LINK>). Thus, an important component of asthma management is identifying individual issues that impair health-related quality of life and treating them (<LINK REF="REF-Rimington-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimington 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juniper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-30 14:55:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although no cure for asthma is known, its symptoms are controllable in most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2008</LINK>). Asthma treatment can be pharmacological or non-pharmacological or a combination of the two associated with strategies of symptom control (environmental triggers and asthma education) (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welsh 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Medications to treat asthma can be broadly divided into long-term controllers and short-term relievers (<LINK REF="REF-Arun-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arun 2012</LINK>). Controller medications are taken daily on a long-term basis, and the relievers are used to rapidly decrease bronchoconstriction and relieve its symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>). Such treatment can be administered in different ways (by inhalation, orally or parenterally) (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Non-pharmacological interventions have gained attention in the treatment of asthma. Complementary and alternative medicine includes breathing exercises, homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy, reflexology, massage, inspiratory muscle training and the Alexander technique (<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarney-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 2012</LINK>). Breathing exercises have been used routinely by physiotherapists and other professionals to control the hyperventilation symptoms of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Bruton-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruton 2005b</LINK>) and can be performed as the Papworth method, Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Work undertaken at the Papworth Hospital, in Cambridge, UK, has changed the techniques used for treatment of asthma and hyperventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Cluff-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluff 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Innocenti--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Innocenti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holloway-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holloway 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lum--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lum 1994</LINK>). The Papworth method focuses on the use of an appropriate breathing pattern to reduce hyperventilation and hyperinflation, therefore increasing CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels and thus reducing the effects of hypocapnia and some symptoms attributed to asthma crisis.</P>
<P>The Buteyko method was developed in the 1950s by Konstantin Buteyko; the rationale behind its use is similar to that of the Papworth method for people who experience hypocapnia as a major contributor to their asthma symptoms. This method aims to develop a more efficient pattern of respiration through the use of controlled breathing and respiratory pauses. As a result, the method intends to increase alveolar and arterial CO<SUB>2</SUB> tension, which may reverse bronchospasm, normalise the breathing pattern and reduce breathlessness (<LINK REF="REF-Bruton-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruton 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Yoga is an ancient discipline from India that has been shown to be an alternative technique for the management of asthma to help reduce anxiety associated with asthma symptoms. Some mechanisms may explain the rationale for yoga, such as reduction in psychological overactivity and emotional instability, and thereby reduction in efferent vagal discharge; increased autonomic control; decreased vagal outflow to the lung causing bronchodilatation and decreased bronchial reactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1990a</LINK>). Yoga breathing techniques include deep breathing exercises (pranayama), which deal explicitly with control of breathing, postures (asanas), cleansing techniques (kriyas), meditation, prayer and often dietary changes to reduce asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-30 14:55:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The worldwide high prevalence of asthma has become a public health problem because of the high healthcare costs resulting from hospitalisation and medication (<LINK REF="REF-Giavina_x002d_Bianchi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giavina-Bianchi 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Breathing exercises have been used widely as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of asthmatic patients, generating considerable interest among researchers to develop studies that seek to show evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention.</P>
<P>This is an update of a review last published in 2003, in which the review authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence on the clinical benefits of breathing exercises in patients with asthma. Recently, new studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of breathing exercises on quality of life, symptom control and lung function in asthmatic patients. Thus, within this review update, we aim to summarise and assess evidence from randomised controlled trials showing the efficacy of breathing exercises in the treatment of patients with asthma.  </P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1998</LINK>, yoga sessions were performed 3 times a week over 16 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Sodhi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sodhi 2009</LINK>, each yoga training session was of 45 minutes' duration per week with a trained instructor for a period of 8 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>, the intervention consisted of 2-week supervised training in lifestyle modification and stress management based on yoga followed by closely monitored continuation of these practises at home for 6 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK>, yoga training consisted of two 1-hour supervised yoga sessions per week for 10 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK>, participants attended yoga training provided by a yoga expert for 5 to 6 days. Thereafter, participants were told to practise yoga for an average of 40 to 50 minutes daily at home for 2 months.

<P>A study is classed as double-blinded if neither the investigator nor the participant involved knows the identity of the intervention. Blinding reduces bias in a trial.

<P>Six studies involving 381 participants reported improvement in quality of life in the groups that submitted to breathing exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>) reported data at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after baseline; one (<LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>) at baseline and at 1, 2 and 6 months; and one (<LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>) at baseline and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>, data were reported at baseline and at post-treatment. Three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>) were included in the meta-analysis. However, the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK> assessed quality of life by the AQLQ, and the study of <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK> assessed this outcome by the SGRQ. When the AQLQ showed the opposite direction of effect to the SGRQ, these questionnaires were analysed separately.</P>
<P>For the outcome 'Change in AQLQ' (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), which included the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>, meta-analysis showed significant differences favouring the breathing exercises group (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08). The postintervention values for the AQLQ in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK> were provided by the author as means and standard deviations.</P>
<P>The statistical analysis for the SGRQ in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK> has a P value that has been adjusted for a baseline covariate. However, the adjusted mean difference was not given in this study. Thus, after the adjusted mean difference was calculated, the analysis for the outcome &#8216;Change in SGRQ&#8217; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>)  yielded a P value smaller than the 0.186 reported in the paper (6 months post-baseline), whereas no difference was seen in the final scores analysis (12 months post-baseline).</P>
<P>We were not able to include the other three studies in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK>). Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK> showed that the group that performed breathing exercises showed improvement in the physical component of the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire compared with controls in all assessments (2, 3 and 6 months after intervention, with P values of 0.003, 0.0002 and 0.066, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK> found significant improvement in the three aspects of the SGRQ (symptoms, activity and impact) in the yoga group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK> observed a significant difference favouring the group submitted to the intervention, with a P value &#706; 0.001 for all four domains of the AQLQ.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK> also assessed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS). This study found significantly lower HADS scores in the intervention group than in the control group, with a P value of 0.002 for HADS Anxiety score and of 0.075 for HDAS Depression score at 6 months post-baseline assessment. At 12 months post-baseline assessment, significant differences favoured the intervention group, with P = 0.772 for the HADS Anxiety score and P &lt; 0.001 for the HADS Depression score.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: asthma symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Five studies involving 331 participants reported asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Girodo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Girodo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>). Meta-analysis was possible for two studies for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Assessment of heterogeneity revealed no significant difference between these two studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Meta-analysis showed significant differences favouring the breathing exercises group (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13). The other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Girodo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Girodo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>) did not report sufficient data to enter the meta-analysis. Of these, one study reported no significant difference in asthma symptoms between yoga and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Girodo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Girodo 1992</LINK> did not observe significant changes in frequency of symptoms on the Asthma Symptom Checklist in any group. However, this study also reported that significant differences (P &lt; 0.03) favoured the intervention group for attack intensity scores (<LINK REF="STD-Girodo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Girodo 1992</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>, the comparison between baseline and postintervention values showed that the Buteyko group had better trends toward improvement in total Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score (P = 0.001) than the pranayama (P = 0.356) and control groups (P = 0.383). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK> did not provide between-group analyses for this outcome.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: number of acute exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Nagarathna-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nagarathna 1985</LINK>). Over two weeks, the intervention group involving 53 participants attended a daily yoga programme lasting two and a half hours. Comparison between the two groups (yoga and control) showed significant improvement (P &lt; 0.005) in the number of exacerbations in the group that received the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Nagarathna-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nagarathna 1985</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: physiological measures</HEADING>
<P>Six studies involving 462 participants reported improvement in spirometry in the groups that performed the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Nagarathna-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nagarathna 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sodhi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sodhi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bidwell-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bidwell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Prem 2013</LINK>). Four studies did not show significant differences in this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fluge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fluge 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2012</LINK>). Only two of the ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sodhi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sodhi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>) were included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). However, because of the substantial heterogeneity indicated by an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic greater than 50% for all variables evaluated in spirometry (peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>), FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC, air flow in the middle of a forced exhalation (FEF<SUB>25-75%</SUB>)), data could not be pooled. This heterogeneity may be attributed to methodological differences in the studies, such as duration of intervention (duration of 45 minutes for 8 weeks vs 4 hours for 2 weeks) for <LINK REF="STD-Sodhi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sodhi 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vempati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vempati 2009</LINK>, respectively.</P>
<P>Two studies also assessed capnography (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK> did not find significant differences between intervention and control groups regarding end-tidal carbon dioxide. However, values for relaxed breathing rate over a 10-minute period showed better results in the intervention group than in the control group, with P &lt; 0.001 at 6- and 12-month post-baseline assessments. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>, the intervention group compared with the control group showed increased end-tidal carbon dioxide (P = 0.002 and 0.003 for 1- and 6-month post-baseline assessments, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for 2-month post-baseline assessment). The intervention group showed a decreased respiratory rate compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>

Both studies had follow-up periods of 1 and 6 months. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK> showed a statistically significant improvement (P = 0.018) in overall AQLQ scores in the intervention group compared with the control group after 1 month. After 6 months, only the improvement in the activities domain of the AQLQ was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group (P = 0.018). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2009</LINK> showed no significant between-group differences in the four subdomains of the AQLQ at 1-month assessment. At 6 months, significantly greater improvements were found in the intervention group in terms of symptoms (P = 0.01), activities (P = 0.01) and emotions (P = 0.05) domains but not in the environment domain (P = 0.40) compared with controls, with a significant between-groups difference favouring the intervention group (P = 0.01) for the total score (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2009</LINK> also assessed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-30 14:56:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review assessed available evidence for the efficacy of breathing exercises in the treatment of patients with asthma. A total of 13 studies involving 906 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. Although these studies met the inclusion criteria, they differed significantly in terms of intervention characteristics, such as type of breathing exercise, number of participants, number and duration of sessions, reported outcomes and statistical presentation of data. These differences limited meta-analysis.  </P>
<P>The included studies reported that breathing exercises were well tolerated by participants, and no adverse effects related to the intervention were described, showing that this is a safe non-pharmacological intervention. All eight studies that assessed quality of life reported improvement in this outcome. Improvement in the number of acute exacerbations was observed by the only study that assessed this outcome. Six of seven included studies showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises for asthma symptoms. Effects on lung function were more variable, with no difference noted in five of the eleven studies that assessed this outcome, although the other six showed a significant difference for this outcome that favoured breathing exercises.</P>
<P>Because the included studies employed different interventions by using different methodologies, meta-analysis for lung function was not possible because of high heterogeneity. For asthma symptoms and changes in AQLQ, meta-analysis showed improvement favouring the group that submitted to breathing exercises. However, each meta-analysis was performed with only two studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-30 14:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The types of breathing exercises that were related to improvements in quality of life, asthma symptoms and numbers of exacerbations were the Papworth method, Buteyko, diaphragmatic breathing and yoga. The ones that improved lung function were Buteyko, yoga and diaphragmatic breathing. However, the effects seen may represent a combination of many characteristics rather than breathing exercises alone. Some of the included studies involved group sessions in which participants were able to talk to each other and share their experiences. This can also be considered a therapeutic procedure that may affect the sensation of well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1993</LINK>). Awareness of participation in the study, the sensation of increased care and cure and the specialists&#8217; recommendations to continue regular asthma medication are characteristics that must be considered when the findings of an experimental study are interpreted (<LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, asthma severity of participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, so it was not possible to assess the effects of breathing exercises on participants with severe asthma. The samples from studies consisted solely of outpatients. Besides that, four of the eight outcomes proposed by this review were not addressed: inpatient hospitalisation episodes, reduction in general practice (GP) and hospital outpatient appointments, days off work and participants' subjective evaluation of the intervention. </P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review was limited by the quality of existing data. Some points must be taken into consideration when the results of this review are analysed, including small sample size and small number of sessions of some studies coupled with limitations in the design and reporting of studies, leading to risk of bias.</P>
<P>In general, the included studies had a small number of participants. The impact of a small sample size on trial results was already reported in a previous study (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1994</LINK>), which reviewed 383 randomised controlled trials. This study concluded that most trials with negative results did not have large enough sample sizes to detect relative differences. Furthermore, the description of how sample size was determined is recommended by the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>). Three of the included studies performed sample size and power calculations: <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK> (based on AQLQ), <LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK> (based on SGRQ) and <LINK REF="STD-Grammatopoulou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grammatopoulou 2011</LINK> (based on ACT). Moreover, the number of sessions involved in these studies was small, given the longer duration of 6 months.</P>
<P>Of the thirteen studies included in the review, only four described the method of random sequence generation and were classified as &#8220;low risk of bias&#8221;. In addition, the allocation concealment was described in only two studies, which had a low risk of bias for this item. According to <LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>, inadequate reporting of trial methods can severely impede assessment of trial quality and of risk of bias in trial results. According to this study, this is a particular problem for the assessment of sequence generation and allocation concealment, which often are not described in trial publications (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>). In addition, inadequately reported randomisation has been associated with bias in estimating the effectiveness of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a randomised controlled trial, at least three distinct groups (trial participants, trial personnel and outcome assessors) can potentially be blinded (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>). When a randomised controlled study that involves breathing exercises is conducted, it is not possible for the participants and the personnel to be blinded to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Holloway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holloway 2007</LINK>). According to <LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>, the lack of or unclear double blinding (participants and personnel) can be associated with marked exaggeration of intervention effect estimates.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although an attempt was made to apply a systematic process for including and excluding studies in this review, besides following the criteria prespecified in the protocol with robust methods for data collection and risk of bias assessment, final decisions are open to interpretation or criticism.</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data may be considered a potential source of bias of this review. This factor has also limited analysis, as the data from these studies could not be entered into a meta-analysis. Also related to meta-analysis, the subgroup and the sensitivity analysis were not possible because of the impossibility of obtaining sufficient data. This could have showed possible differences in degree of asthma severity, age groups and duration of treatment. Moreover, sensitivity analysis could have identified the influence of some factors (such as trial quality and trial size) on the results, thus revealing a source of the substantial heterogeneity found among studies on lung function.  </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:22:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current review update included eight new randomised controlled trials and removed two trials that were included in the last published version of this review. In addition, this review brings together trials that were not included in previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>). These two reviews assessed the effectiveness of breathing exercises in the management of asthma. The outcomes assessed by <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK> were asthma symptoms and lung function, and those assessed by <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK> were quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of exacerbations and lung function.</P>
<P>The findings of this review show that, even though outcomes reported by individual trials showed improvement in quality of life indices, asthma symptoms, number of exacerbations and lung function of participants who submitted to breathing exercises, evidence supporting the efficacy of breathing exercises in these outcomes is not sufficient. The systematic review performed by <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK> affirmed that, on the basis of available data, it was not possible to make firm judgments. Also, this review suggested that breathing techniques seem to have some potential and should be tested rigorously in the future. Similarly, the systematic review performed by <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK> concluded that because evidence available from the small randomised controlled trials included in the review is limited, it was not possible to draw any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness of breathing exercises in the treatment and management of asthma.</P>
<P>It is important to emphasise that, even though the results of this review are consistent with results reported by the two previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>), some methodological differences have been noted among these studies. The review of <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK> was published more than one decade ago. Moreover, this review included two cross-over studies and one study that was performed with children admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma. <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK> included only six studies, which did not involve the same breathing exercise techniques that were examined by the present review, such as the Papworth method.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:22:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review indicates that breathing exercises are a safe and well-tolerated intervention for people with asthma. Also, meta-analysis of two studies showed that breathing exercises may have positive effects on asthma symptoms and quality of life (more specifically, on AQLQ score). Even though outcomes that were reported from individual trials show that breathing exercises may have a role in the treatment and management of asthma, no conclusive evidence is provided in this review to support or refute the benefits of these techniques in terms of quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of exacerbations and lung function. This is a result of the small number of participants in most of the included studies, the small number of sessions, the methodological differences among included studies, trials with poor methodology and the statistical heterogeneity noted among the studies for three of the four outcomes assessed by meta-analysis. No data are available regarding the effects of breathing exercises on inpatient hospitalisation episodes, reduction in GP and hospital outpatient appointments, days off work and participants' subjective evaluation of the intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-23 14:22:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical benefit of breathing exercises in the management of asthma, including those that were not assessed by the studies included in this review such as inpatient hospitalisation episodes, reduction in GP and hospital outpatient appointments, days off work and participants' subjective evaluation of the intervention. Furthermore, in the future, much more attention needs to be paid to good reporting and high-quality study design, including items such as adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor and determination of the trial sample size before the study is begun.</P>
