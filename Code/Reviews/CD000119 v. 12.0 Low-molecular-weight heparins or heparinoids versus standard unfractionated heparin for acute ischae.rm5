<TITLE MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">Which types of blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulants) are best to prevent blood clots in people soon after stroke?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review aimed to find out which type of blood-thinning drug works best for preventing blood clots in people who have recently had a stroke due to blockage of an artery in the brain.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Stroke is a common and disabling disease. Sudden blockage of an artery to the brain, often caused by a blood clot, is the cause of the most common type of stroke. This type is called an ischaemic stroke. Anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs), are widely used in people with stroke. As stroke is a medical emergency, and medicines given in an emergency need to reach the bloodstream quickly, these are given by injection. Injectable anticoagulants that have been tested in stroke are unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), and heparinoids. These agents may help clear blocked arteries, prevent re-blockage, and prevent clots forming in leg veins (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) after an ischaemic stroke and so might prevent fatal or disabling complications of stroke and improve the chance of a good recovery. However, they can also cause harmful bleeding complications that can offset any benefits.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The search was updated to February 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for randomised controlled trials in people with recent onset of stroke symptoms that compared LMWH or heparinoids with UFH. </P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found nine trials involving 3137 participants; overall these trials had a moderate risk of bias (this means that the results are likely to be less credible than if the risk of bias was low). No new trials were included in this updated review. None of the studies reported reliable information on disability or recovery after stroke. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (quality of the evidence was low). Although LMWH or heparinoid were associated with significantly fewer clots in leg veins (DVT) than UFH, the number of major events such as when a blood clot becomes lodged in an artery in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and bleeding inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhages) was too small to know whether the harms outweighed the benefits. For people with ischaemic stroke who need immediate treatment with anticoagulants, evidence from the included clinical trials did not provide reliable evidence on the balance of risk and benefit for each type of heparin. Additional large scale research would be needed to resolve this uncertainty.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. Using GRADE criteria we found that evidence quality was low overall.</P>

<P>To determine whether antithrombotic therapy with LMWHs or heparinoids is associated with a reduction in the proportion of people who are dead or dependent for activities in daily living compared with UFH.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:49:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched February 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: <I>the Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2017), and Embase (1980 to February 2017). We also searched trials registers to February 2017: ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, Stroke Trials Registry, ISRCTN Registry and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.</P>

<P>Unconfounded randomised trials comparing LMWH or heparinoids with standard UFH in people with acute ischaemic stroke, in which participants were recruited within 14 days of stroke onset.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-08 09:49:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently chose studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and trial quality, extracted and analysed the data. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-09 22:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included nine trials involving 3137 participants. We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this updated review. None of the studies reported data on the primary outcome in sufficient detail to enable analysis for the review. Overall, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (96/1616 allocated LMWH/heparinoid versus 78/1486 allocated UFH; odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47; 8 trials, 3102 participants, low quality evidence). LMWH or heparinoid were associated with a significant reduction in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with UFH (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.70, 7 trials, 2585 participants, low quality evidence). However, the number of the major clinical events such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and intracranial haemorrhage was too small to provide a reliable estimate of the effects.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Treatment with a LMWH or heparinoid after acute ischaemic stroke appears to decrease the occurrence of DVT compared with standard UFH, but there are too few data to provide reliable information on their effects on other important outcomes, including functional outcome, death and intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

<P>Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and heparinoids are anticoagulants that may have more powerful antithrombotic effects than standard unfractionated heparin (UFH) but a lower risk of bleeding complications. This is an update of the Cochrane Review <I>Low-molecular-weight heparins or heparinoids versus standard unfractionated heparin for acute ischaemic stroke</I>, first published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Counsell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Counsell 2001</LINK>) and last updated in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-22 12:15:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Worldwide, stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability in both developed and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>). Four-fifths of all strokes are caused by reduction in, or blockage of, blood flow in the artery supplying a particular part of brain; this type of stroke is called an ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>). A common cause of ischaemic stroke is a blood clot that developed in the heart or large arteries travelling through the circulation to block a brain blood vessel (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Anticoagulants act on different components of the coagulation system to reduce fibrin and thrombus formation (<LINK REF="REF-Holbrook-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holbrook 2012</LINK>). Some anticoagulants, such as Vitamin K antagonists, can only be given by mouth, have a slow onset of action, and so are not suitable for use as an emergency treatment in acute stroke where prompt onset of effect is needed and where difficulty swallowing from the stroke may preclude oral administration. The anticoagulant agents that have commonly been used in people with stroke that can be given parenterally and have a rapid onset of action are unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and heparinoids (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>). Standard UFH is a sulphated polysaccharide that affects the coagulation pathway by inhibition of Factor Xa and thrombin activity (<LINK REF="REF-Choay-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choay 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cruickshank-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruickshank 1991</LINK>). LMWHs are smaller molecules derived from heparin and act predominantly to inhibit Factor Xa (<LINK REF="REF-Cella-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weitz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 1997</LINK>). Heparinoids are aminoglycans that inhibit thrombin activity via activation of the effect of heparin co-factor 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Shorr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorr 2008</LINK>). LMWHs and heparinoids have better bioavailability and longer half-life compared with UFH (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meuleman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meuleman 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In people with ischaemic stroke who arrive in hospital within the first few hours of onset, anticoagulants may be used as an emergency treatment to help dissolve the blood clot blocking the cerebral vessel, or to prevent new blood clots forming in arteries or veins. Early use of anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke might therefore have several beneficial effects: to reduce cerebral damage from the initial stroke, prevent early recurrent ischaemic stroke, and prevent venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). VTEs include deep vein thrombosis (DVT, a blood clot lodging in a deep vein of the leg) and pulmonary embolism (PE, a blood clot lodging in an artery in the lungs). These actions of anticoagulants might reduce the chance of death from vascular causes, increase the chance of neurological recovery, and so improve the person's overall clinical outcome after acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:50:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised trials comparing UFH, LMWH, and heparinoids with placebo have not provided any convincing evidence that these agents improve survival or functional outcome of people with acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TOAST-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">TOAST 1998</LINK>). This is probably because any reductions in early recurrent ischaemic stroke or PE were offset by similar-sized increases in intra- and extracranial haemorrhages (bleeding inside and outside the brain). There was no difference in the overall clinical outcome, at final follow up as measured by the proportion of people dead or dependent at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TOAST-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">TOAST 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the Cochrane Review of the randomised trials comparing anticoagulant regimens with control in acute ischaemic stroke showed that anticoagulant therapy significantly reduced the odds of DVT by about 66%, from a rate of about 44% in those allocated to control, to 15% in those allocated to anticoagulants (<LINK REF="REF-Gubitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>). There was also a significant 36% reduction in the odds of PE with anticoagulants. Hence, clinicians may still wish to consider the use of heparin in low dose for the prevention of DVT and life threatening PE.</P>
<P>The coagulation cascades are inhibited non-specifically at a number of different sites by standard UFH. It also inhibits platelet function (<LINK REF="REF-Choay-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choay 1989</LINK>). These multiple blood thinning effects may increase the potential for UFH to cause haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1990</LINK>), and so anticoagulant agents with more specific sites of action may be associated with lower risks of haemorrhage. Two such classes of agents are LMWHs and heparinoids. LMWHs and heparinoids have a more powerful antithrombotic effect than UFH and they also have a much longer half-life (period for which a drug actively affects the body) (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meuleman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meuleman 1992</LINK>). Although, from the described pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, LMWHs and heparinoids should be safer to use in acute stroke than UFH, a systematic review of trials of LMWH with control suggested the greater antithrombotic efficacy was offset by greater bleeding risk (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous reviews of anticoagulants versus control provided only indirect comparisons of the safety and efficacy of the different agents and such indirect comparisons are prone to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Gubitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 1993</LINK>). Only trials providing a direct randomised comparison of LMWHs or heparinoids with UFH will provide an unbiased assessment of the risk of haemorrhage, vascular death, and the effect on overall clinical outcome. Hence, a Cochrane Review of all the randomised trials directly comparing LMWHs or heparinoids with UFH to provide an unbiased assessment of the merits of each agent was first published in 2005 and updated in 2008. In our view, since high dose heparin is still occasionally used as a treatment for stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2016</LINK>) and low-dose heparins are still used for prevention of DVT and PE in up to 40% of people with stroke in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Amin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amin 2013</LINK>), an update was required to determine whether there were any new trials that may potentially change the conclusions of the previous review.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<UL>
<LI>Primary: to determine whether antithrombotic therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids is associated with a reduction in the proportion of people who are dead or dependent for activities in daily living compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH).</LI>
<LI>Secondary: to determine whether, compared with UFH antithrombotic therapy with LMWHs or heparinoids is associated with:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>a difference in deaths;</LI>
<LI>a lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) compared with UFH;</LI>
<LI>a reduction of the risk of early recurrent ischaemic strokes compared with UFH;</LI>
<LI>an increased risk of fatal or disabling intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>Note: the previous versions of this Cochrane Review did not specify a primary outcome, but sought to compare the effects of LMWH and heparinoids and UFH across a range of outcomes. When this update was planned we defined the primary objective and the primary outcome to be consistent with other Cochrane Stroke Reviews, since the proportion of people who are dead or dependent for activities in daily living provides a single outcome that captures the net longer-term effect on the person of the benefits and harms of this short-term treatment.</P>

<P>We included all unconfounded and truly randomised trials in this Cochrane Review. In these trials, the use of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke was compared with standard unfractionated heparin (UFH) as control. We did not include randomised trials in which the method of allocation to treatment or control group was not adequately concealed (e.g. allocation by alternation, date of birth, hospital number, day of the week, or open random number list). This is because foreknowledge of treatment allocation might lead to biased allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Odgaard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgaard-Jensen 2011</LINK>) and hence to misleading estimates of treatment effect.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We excluded trials that randomised people more than 14 days after onset of the stroke and trials in people with only transient ischaemic attacks because this Cochrane Review was confined to early treatment of acute stroke. It was not essential for all people to have computed tomography (CT) scanning before entry to the trial (we were interested in people with confirmed or presumed ischaemic stroke), but we excluded trials which only included people with definite haemorrhagic stroke (stroke due to bleeding in the brain rather than blockage of an artery).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Trials that compared a LMWH or heparinoid possessing anticoagulant activity with UFH were eligible. The UFH was administered either as a low dose subcutaneous regimen or a high dose intravenous one.</P>
<P>The heparinoids currently available included: Org 10172/danaparoid (Orgaran), dermatan sulphate, mesoglycan, and pentosan polysulphate. The LMWHs or heparinoids were administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. We identified all trials, irrespective of whether the purpose of therapy was to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), to reduce neurological disability, or to reduce the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>The LMWHs currently available included: Kabi 2165/dalteparin (Fragmin); CY 216/nadroparin (Fraxiparine); CY 222; PK 10169/enoxaparin (Clexane/Lovenox); LHN-1/tinzaparin (Logiparin/Innohep); OP 2123/parnaparin (Fluxum); certoparin (Sandoparin); reviparin (Clivarine); and Sandoz LMWH.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The two review authors (PS and TL) independently extracted and cross-checked the data. We extracted data such as the number of people with each outcome event, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance, and whether or not the person was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. This approach was applied to allow for an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. We sought data on whether or not CT or MR scanning was performed prior to randomisation. If any of the above data items were not available in the publications, we sought further information by correspondence with the trial authors. We checked to see whether there was evidence to suggest that previously excluded studies should be included and whether ongoing or studies awaiting assessment could be included, but further information was not available for any of these studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For previous versions of this review, the authors did not use a scoring system to assess quality but only assessed risk of bias of included studies. In the previous version, the table of included studies gave details of the randomisation method, blinding, whether an ITT analysis was possible from the published data, and the number of people lost to follow-up. The only dimension of risk of bias that we graded was allocation concealment. However, for this update, we scored the key elements of risk of bias for each included study according to current Cochrane guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and generated a risk of bias summary table.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:51:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Trials of each type of anticoagulant, (LMWHs or heparinoids) were compared to UFH to assess whether there was any difference between these classes of anticoagulants. We reported relative effects as odds ratios (OR, the ratio of the odds of an unfavourable outcome among people treated with either LMWHs or heparinoids versus UFH). We calculated the OR using the Peto fixed-effect method with its 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>

<P>During the anticoagulation period with LMWH, heparinoids, or UFH, an increased risk of death due to intracranial haemorrhage would only be apparent if most participants had autopsies or CT brain scan shortly before death. However, this was generally not the case, so reliable attribution of any deaths during the treatment period to intracranial haemorrhages was not possible. Intracranial haemorrhage carries an early case fatality of 50% or more, so analysis of deaths from all causes during the treatment period would be more sensitive to an excess of deaths related to intracranial haemorrhage than an analysis of all deaths during the whole of follow-up. Death data were available from eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dumas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dumas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hageluken-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hageluken 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillbom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hillbom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROTECT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PROTECT 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiekema-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stiekema 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRACE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TRACE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1992</LINK>) with 3102 participants (98.8% of the total participants included in the review).

There was no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0 %) among the interventions. The confidence interval was compatible with substantial harm (an extra 2 deaths per 100 people treated) and substantial benefit (2 fewer deaths per 100 people treated).

Methods of detecting DVT were variable. Four trials used I¹²&#8309; fibrinogen scanning, two mostly used contrast venography, and one used Doppler ultrasound detecting only proximal leg DVT. Nevertheless, some participants either did not have the appropriate investigation or had an inadequate assessment of DVT. For instance, in <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Hillbom-1998">Hillbom 1998</A> 30 participants allocated enoxaparin and 34 allocated UFH did not have venography or had an inadequate examination; in <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Dumas-1994">Dumas 1994</A> four participants allocated UFH did not have valid I¹²&#8309; fibrinogen scans or venograms; in <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Hageluken-1992">Hageluken 1992</A> 16 participants allocated to danaparoid and eight participants allocated to UFH did not have valid DVT assessments; and in <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-PREVAIL-2007">PREVAIL 2007</A> 218 participants allocated enoxaparin and 209 allocated UFH had no or an inadequate assessment of DVT. These participants were retained in their original treatment groups for the main analysis, and we assumed that none had a DVT, except for <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK>, where there were many excluded participants and so DVT was analysed in the per-protocol efficacy population.</P>
<P>The proportion of participants not undergoing venography was quite high in a number of studies. A modified worst-case scenario analysis was performed with the assumption that the excluded participants in the LMWH or heparinoid arm had a DVT rate that was equal to the highest rate in any arm in any included trial (31% in the <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1992</LINK> UFH arm) and those excluded in the UFH arm had a DVT rate equal to the lowest rate in any arm (7% in the <LINK REF="STD-PROTECT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PROTECT 2006</LINK> LMWH arm). This method has been applied in other Cochrane Reviews (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Macleod-2005">Macleod 2005</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sandercock-2003a">Sandercock 2003a</A>).</P>

However, the result was no longer statistically significant in the modified worst-case scenario analysis (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06). Both the heparinoid (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86, P = 0.01) and the LMWH (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73, P &lt; 0.00001) regimens were associated with lower incidence of DVT compared with UFH.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome analysis 1.6: PE during follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Six trials, involving 1250 participants (39.8% of the total number of participants), presented data on symptomatic PE. However, not all surviving participants had pulmonary ventilation scans because confirmation of PE was not sought systematically. Furthermore, not all participants who died had autopsies, which could lead to bias in the results. In addition, there were too few participants with PE to generate substantial evidence on whether or not the observed trend in favour of LMWH or heparinoid was significant or happened merely by chance (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.41, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).

We excluded <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK> from our analyses because data were only available for the treatment period and not the scheduled follow-up period (PE occurring during the treatment in 1/666 enoxaparin versus 6/669 UFH participants, absolute risk difference &#8211;0.7%, 95% CI &#8211;1.5 to 0).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome analysis 1.7: Any intracranial haemorrhage/haemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarct during treatment period</HEADING>
<P>Irresepctive of clinical deterioration, ideally an unbiased assessment of the effect of treatment on the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage or haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct (HTI) would come from studies in which CT or MR scanning was performed systematically in all surviving participants at the beginning and end of the scheduled treatment period. However, the overall risk of intracranial haemorrhage may have been underestimated because it did not include those participants who may have died from an intracranial haemorrhage before a second scan could be performed and did not have an autopsy. The compromise of this scenario and the least biased and most fair assessment would be of the effect of treatment on the intracranial haemorrhage event or HTI detected by routine repeat CT scanning performed at the end of the scheduled treatment period in all survivors and by autopsy in all those who died during the treatment period (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Sandercock-1993">Sandercock 1993</A>). However, none of the included studies undertook this as a pre-specified analysis.</P>
<P>All trials also reported intracranial haemorrhage associated with clinical deterioration (symptomatic HTI) but this analysis could lead to bias, particularly if the trial was not double-blind. In addition, the definition of deterioration varied between trials. 'Any HTI' was relatively uncommon (2.4% in all groups combined) and 'symptomatic HTI' was even more rare (0.9% in all groups combined). We may have underestimated the risk of any HTI somewhat because in <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Hillbom-1998">Hillbom 1998</A> approximately 10% (20/212) of participants did not have a repeat CT scan and we assumed these participants did not have a haemorrhage. For this comparison (9 trials, 3137 participants) there was no significant difference in any HTI between LMWH or heparinoid and UFH (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.23, P = 0.25, I² = 0%, low quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome analysis 1.8: Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage/haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct during treatment period</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for eight trials (3102 participants). Overall, there was no significant difference in symptomatic HTI for LMWH or heparinoid versus UFH (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.54, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). However, these analyses were based on very small numbers of events so the confidence intervals were very wide, implying that the available data were inadequate to provide reliable evidence on any possible excess risk of intracranial haemorrhage associated with LMWH or heparinoid compared with UFH.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome analysis 1.9: Extracranial haemorrhage during treatment period</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials (3012 participants; 96% of included participants) reported data on extracranial haemorrhage during the treatment period. Only 14 major extracranial haemorrhages occurred (0.5% of all participants); this very low absolute risk of serious bleeding is probably related to the fact that participants considered to be at high risk of bleeding were excluded from the trials. LMWH or danaparoid were associated with a substantially higher risk of major extracranial bleeding than UFH (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.30 to 11.06, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Information on minor haemorrhages is probably less reliable because it was less systematically reported and definitions varied; for example, some trials reported minor bruising at the injection site whilst others did not. Minor extracranial haemorrhages were common (6.5% of all participants) and were mainly related to skin haematomas (formed by blood clots, and giving rise to a swelling under the skin) at the injection sites, mild haematemesis (vomiting of blood) in participants with nasogastric tubes, or mild haematuria (blood in urine) in participants with urinary catheters. There was no difference in minor bleeds in those participants allocated to LMWH or danaparoid compared with UFH (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.24, I² = 0%).</P>

Although there were trends towards greater benefit in terms of DVT prevention with larger doses of danaparoid and with twice daily compared with once daily administration, these were not significant and were based on very few data.

<P>It is not yet clear whether routine use of any anticoagulant treatment at all in acute stroke is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>), and so it is perhaps premature to start comparing different anticoagulant regimens. In contrast, aspirin has been shown to be effective in improving neurological outcomes and preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) following ischaemic stroke and carries little risk of major haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall benefit of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparinoids versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in acute ischaemic stroke</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials reported information on the primary outcome for this Cochrane Review update. Overall the included trials were at moderate risk of bias, and the quality of evidence for all outcomes assessed was low according to GRADE criteria. The analyses, which included only limited data on major clinical outcomes, suggested that, while LMWH or heparinoids may yield greater protection against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than UFH, such benefits might be offset by an excess of intracranial haemorrhages and major extracranial haemorrhages, but the data on these potential risks in this update were inadequate. The numbers of deaths, intracranial haemorrhages, and major extracranial haemorrhages were small, and so the confidence intervals were wide and hence could not rule out significant harm from LMWH or heparinoids.</P>
<P>For example, in <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK>, although the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (symptomatic plus asymptomatic) was significantly lower among participants given LMWH, the study could not exclude a 69% increase in the risk of death up to day 14 and a 134% increase in the risk of intracranial haemorrhage with LMWH. This was because the event rates for these major clinical outcomes were low: PE and intracerebral haemorrhage occurred in 1% of participants respectively. It was challenging to conduct a trial large enough to assess the balance risk and benefit of the intervention with such low event rates.</P>

Many DVTs detected in stroke patients are clinically silent, and there is debate about the extent to which reductions in asymptomatic DVT correlate with reductions in clinically significant episodes of VTE (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Lowe-2003">Lowe 2003</A>). There were too few people with PE among the included trials to generate substantial evidence on whether or not the observed trend in favour of LMWH or heparinoid was merely by chance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of intra- and extracranial haemorrhage in acute ischaemic stroke with LMWH or heparinoids versus UFH</HEADING>
<P>Although there was no significant difference in intracranial haemorrhage between LMWH or heparinoid and UFH during treatment periods, in participants allocated to LMWH or heparinoid versus UFH, there was a statistically significant increase in major extracranial haemorrhages. However, there were only 14 major extracranial haemorrhages (0.5% of all participants). This very low absolute risk of serious bleeding was probably related to the fact that participants considered to be at high risk of bleeding were excluded from the trials. Information on minor haemorrhages should be interpreted cautiously because these events were systematically reported less frequently and definitions varied; for example, some trials reported minor bruising at the injection site but others did not. There was no difference in minor bleeds among participants allocated to LMWH or danaparoid compared with UFH.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:54:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Most included trials were conducted more than 10 years ago, which may raise concerns about whether these results are still relevant for current clinical practice. The management of people with acute ischaemic stroke in the past two decades has changed, especially where acute stroke units have been established that provide better general care, early rehydration and active mobilisation which may reduce VTE frequency. On the other hand, greater use of intravenous thrombolysis may increase the haemorrhagic risks of anticoagulation. However, these changes in background clinical care may be expected to alter the absolute risks of various outcomes, but not greatly alter the estimates of relative effect of anticoagulation. It is unclear whether these data remain relevant in current clinical practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-03-22 12:15:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five of nine included trials did not specify methods of random sequence generation, and eight did not specify how allocation concealment was achieved, leading to assessment of unclear risk of selection bias. Most included trials did not provide sufficient information to enable assessment of selective reporting, hence risk of reporting bias was assessed as unclear (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Overall, for each of the outcomes reported in our 'Summary of findings' table, the quality of evidence was graded as low. Furthermore, the largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK> (N = 1762), was unblinded, which may have led to performance bias that could potentially affect review findings. The funnel plot analysis included too few studies to provide reliable evidence of, or reliably to exclude, publication bias.</P>
<P>This review does not reliably answer the question it set out to address: whether heparinoids or LMWHs are more effective, yet as safe as UFH to prevent neurological disability and VTE in people with acute ischaemic stroke. To provide guidance on which categories of people with ischaemic stroke may benefit from heparinoids or LMWHs, and more accurate and precise estimates of the risks of death and haemorrhage, much larger randomised controlled trials are required that compare danaparoid (or LMWHs) with UFH and with control in many thousands of participants. It is unlikely that any trial of this size could ever be performed.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-02-22 13:37:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Completeness of the searches: we are confident that the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register is an efficient and reliable way of identifying registered and ongoing trials relevant to this review. The extensive searches performed for the 2008 review and in 2015 for this update did not identify any major large-scale studies that were underway at the time of searching. The Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register was searched again in July 2016 before this update was submitted. However, given the large number of apparently randomised stroke trials reported in scant detail in hard-to-access literature in China, it is possible that some may have been eligible for inclusion. The reports we have been able to obtain from China (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2000</LINK>) were only available as abstracts and none clearly met our inclusion criteria. At least one trial was closed but never reported data (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Moulin-1994">Moulin 1994</A>), and another three are thought to be ongoing trials but no details were available (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508061438417848484830427744512&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Aventis-2002">Aventis 2002</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Heparinas-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Heparinas 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2001</LINK>). The changes to the protocol between the previous version and this update were minor and could not have introduced bias, since no data were available for our primary outcome.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:54:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A non-Cochrane review of LMWH versus UFH in people with ischaemic stroke supported the use of LMWH, due to the benefit of reducing venous thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-Shorr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorr 2008</LINK>). The study reported that there were no statistically significant increases in haemorrhage or death compared with UFH. However, a more recent and comprehensive review of heparin for DVT prophylaxis in medical patients found that in hospitalised medical patients (including those with stroke), heparin prophylaxis had no significant effect on mortality, may have reduced PE in medical patients and all patients combined, and led to more bleeding and major bleeding events, thus resulting in little or no net benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Lederle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederle 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is new in this update?</HEADING>
<P>For this update, the main searches were performed up to February 2017. We identified no new studies that met review inclusion criteria. We identified a report of a sub-analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-PREVAIL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PREVAIL 2007</LINK> trial published in 2009 that contained limited additional outcome data which were subsequently included in this updated review. However, the overall results and conclusions remained the same as 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>). In previous versions of this review, outcomes were not divided into primary or secondary outcomes. In this updated review, the primary outcome was identified as the proportion dead or dependent in activities in daily living. We added more detailed assessment of risk of bias, funnel plots to assess for publication bias and a summary of findings table.</P>

<P>For clinicians who, despite the lack of evidence of overall benefit from routine anticoagulants in people with acute ischaemic stroke, still wish to use some form of anticoagulant regimen in selected people with acute ischaemic stroke:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the criteria to identify those few people that might benefit from the unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparinoid regimens tested in these trials have not been defined;</LI>
<LI>LMWH and heparinoids appear to be more effective at preventing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) - and possibly also pulmonary embolism (PE) - than UFH. However, their safety, compared with UFH, has not reliably been established in people with stroke.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-17 15:54:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>It may well be that other antithrombotic agents, such as aspirin, will prove to be the antithrombotic agent with the most favourable balance of risk and benefit for use in people with acute ischaemic stroke. Further very large-scale trials may be worthwhile comparing:</P>
<UL>
<LI>aspirin alone with aspirin plus low-dose LMWH (or heparinoid) in individuals at particularly high risk of DVT and PE; and</LI>
<LI>a more aggressive LMWH (or heparinoid) regimen with UFH and with aspirin only in certain categories of people, for example those with a cardiac source of emboli. These trials should measure disability and recurrent stroke as well as venous thromboembolism and major haemorrhages.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Given the lack of evidence for the routine use of any anticoagulant regimen in acute ischaemic stroke and the evidence in favour of using aspirin, further trials comparing only heparinoids or LMWH with UFH would be hard to justify.</P>

<P>For this update, the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> was revised, updated and new references added. For consistency with other Cochrane Stroke Group reviews, we defined a single primary objective for the review and consequently selected a single primary outcome. The main search strategies were reviewed and search terms updated (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). No changes to the methods of analysis were required. A PRISMA diagram was added (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We added funnel plots (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). We rechecked all included studies and evaluated the risk of bias for each study in greater detail. We added 'Risk of bias' tables. We also conducted GRADE assessment and included <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The analytic methods did not change.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:12:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>If unfractionated heparin (UFH) does not benefit patients with acute ischaemic stroke, why do a review where UFH is the control intervention? Although low-molecular-weight heparins/heparinoids (LMWH) do not reduce death or disability (but do increase intracranial bleeding), should the 'Implications for practice' justify LMWH in some case of acute ischaemic stroke in view of their reduction of deep vein thrombosis (and probably pulmonary embolism) in comparison with UFH? Similarly, are further trials of anticoagulant ethical?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:15:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The first version of the review was prepared at a time when there was uncertainty about the overall effects of heparins in acute ischaemic stroke. Since then, as the commenter states, evidence has emerged which shows that there is no net benefit from the immediate anticoagulation in this setting. However, as is often the case, this evidence did not alter the beliefs of some clinicians, and hence, heparin is still used in some countries, in certain types of patient with acute ischaemic stroke, for specific reasons and especially for prevention of venous thrombo-embolism.</P>
<P>This review is now based on the premise that if a clinician plans to treat a patient for some special reason with some form of heparin then the choice of agent should be evidence based. The wording of the 'Implications for practice' and 'Implications for research' sections reflect this.</P>
<P>I should point out that this review is currently being updated, and we have identified three further trials comparing LMWH with UFH in acute stroke, which testifies to the belief among some clinicians in the value of this form of treatment. The emergence of new evidence is a good reason to keep the review up to date.</P>
