<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 17:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ramsay Hunt syndrome (also known as herpes zoster oticus) consists of weakness of the face due to infection with the varicella zoster virus.  Five cases arise per 100,000 of the population per year in the US.  It is more common among those over 60 and rare in children. Other symptoms may include severe ear pain and small blisters on the outer ear or in the mouth.  Prompt diagnosis and treatment (ideally within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms) are crucial to secure the best outcomes. In cases where treatment has been started within this time period, facial weakness recovers in up to 75% of patients. Standard treatment is with antiviral therapy (most commonly acyclovir). Corticosteroids are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used together with antivirals to reduce the inflammation in the facial nerve.  This is thought to be the cause of the facial weakness.  The aim of the review was to see if corticosteroids, used at the same time as antiviral drugs, improved outcomes in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.  However the review found no trials matching the inclusion criteria, and no conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of using corticosteroids in this way.   It is recommended that high-quality randomised controlled trials be undertaken to address this issue.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition, prevalence and aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Herpes zoster oticus is a viral infection of the inner, middle and external ear characterised by herpetic blisters (small vesicles) of the skin of the external canal, pinna and/or the oral mucosa and severe otalgia (ear pain). These symptoms can be accompanied by one or more of the following: vestibulocochlear dysfunction (e.g. vertigo, hearing loss, hyperacusis, and tinnitus) taste impairment, dry mouth and eyes.</P>
<P>When herpes zoster oticus is associated with acute peripheral facial paralysis the condition is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-Hunt-1907" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay Hunt 1907</LINK>). Although the terms 'herpes zoster oticus' and 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome' are frequently used interchangeably in the literature, this review will focus only on Ramsay Hunt syndrome and consider for inclusion trials with participants suffering from herpes zoster oticus with accompanying facial weakness.</P>
<P>The incidence of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is about five cases per 100,000 of the US population annually, with a significantly increased incidence in patients older than 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). The condition is considered to be both less frequent and less severe in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>), but reports of children are limited in the literature and the clinical features and prognosis of paediatric Ramsay Hunt syndrome remain unclear. Vaccination against chickenpox (both in childhood and in later life) may prevent or reduce its occurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Guess-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guess 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion (the sensory ganglion of the facial nerve) which affects the seventh and eighth cranial nerves. This is due to the close proximity of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>). The subsequent dysfunction of cranial nerves VII and VIII is thought to be caused primarily by varicella-zoster virus neuritis and to a lesser extent by inflammatory oedema. Maximal facial paralysis is generally seen within one week. Although less common than Bell's palsy (i.e. idiopathic facial palsy), Ramsay Hunt syndrome generally causes more severe dysfunction and has a poorer prognosis for facial nerve recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Uri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uri 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">History, examination and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Early diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is extremely important, as antiviral treatment within the first 72 hours of the onset of symptoms is generally considered to be crucial to the resolution of some (if not all) symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the presentation of a combination of severe ear pain, small vesicles on the pinna or oral mucosa and facial palsy. When patients present with acute facial weakness a high index of suspicion is required in order to recognise the condition, deliver prompt treatment and obtain the best possible outcome. Although the appearance of vesicles usually precedes or presents simultaneously with facial paralysis, it may be delayed until after facial weakness is clinically evident, thus making the condition initially indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. Symptoms and signs of vestibulocochlear dysfunction are not always present but can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, nystagmus, nausea and vomiting.</P>
<P>The clinical picture remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, as serum titres of varicella-zoster virus antibodies are only useful when comparing the acute and convalescent stages of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>). The use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect varicella-zoster virus from skin of the affected area of the ear may help to distinguish between patients with Bell's palsy and patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome in the very early stages (<LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>If diagnosis is made and antiviral treatment commenced within 72 hours of the onset of symptom(s), the facial palsy recovery rate has been reported in non-randomised studies to be as high as 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). However, even with early treatment, the absence of demonstrable lack of nerve excitability, complete paralysis and age over 50 years at presentation are said to be significant factors for increased risk of poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 2001</LINK>). By contrast, the prognosis for associated sensorineural hearing loss associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome is excellent, and only around 5% of patients will have residual hearing impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Kaberos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaberos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1997</LINK>). Other potentially chronic sequelae are post-herpetic neuralgia, tinnitus and vestibular dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management options</HEADING>
<P>The standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster infections at sites in the body other than the ear is the antiviral agent acyclovir, which is given either intravenously or orally<B>.</B> Other antiviral agents that may be prescribed include valacyclovir, famcyclovir or brivudin (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiviral therapy is only effective against virus replication in herpes zoster - that is, it can prevent further proliferation and spread of the varicella-zoster virus - and cannot eradicate herpes viruses. Oral antiviral treatment has been shown by two meta-analyses (of four and five randomised controlled trials respectively) to lessen the severity of herpes zoster virus infection in immunocompetent adults by reducing the duration of viral shedding and new lesion formation, thereby accelerating rash healing and reducing the duration of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is generally held that the use of oral antivirals is limited to a period of seven to ten days (<LINK REF="REF-Bean-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1994</LINK>) and needs to be started within 72 hours of the onset of a rash. They are generally very well tolerated if administered at standard doses (acyclovir: 800 mg five times/day for 7 to 10 days; famcyclovir: 500 mg three times/day for seven days; valacyclovir: 1000 mg three times/day for seven days) and providing patients are kept well hydrated (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinishi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinishi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lampee-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampee 1986</LINK>). The most common side effects are nausea (and occasionally vomiting) and headache, which occur in 10% to 20% of cases. Other possible side effects include renal impairment, diarrhoea, dizziness, fatigue, skin rash, anorexia, leg pain, medication taste, sore throat and hair loss from prolonged use (<LINK REF="REF-Bean-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bean 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickins 1988</LINK>). Any allergic reaction to antiviral medications is a contraindication to their use (<LINK REF="REF-Peterslund-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterslund 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral brivudin appears to have a higher potency against varicella-zoster virus than the oral regimes of acyclovir, valacyclovir and famcyclovir. It also has a simpler regime (once a day) and no nephrotoxic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2003</LINK>). However, antivirals cannot prevent either the acute or chronic pain experienced by about 20% of patients over 50 years of age with herpes zoster and therefore supplementary therapies, most frequently adjuvant corticosteroids, are often prescribed for herpes zoster infections, including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The rationale for their use is to reduce nerve inflammation and associated pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids are used therapeutically in a wide variety of conditions. In herpes zoster infections, synthetic glucocorticoids such as prednisone and prednisolone are frequently prescribed for their anti-inflammatory properties. A recent comprehensive overview of treatments for <U>all types of herpes zoster infections</U> (i.e. not just Ramsay Hunt syndrome) states that although, "Two well-designed clinical trials [have] demonstrated that the addition of a 3-week tapering dosage of a corticosteroid did not contribute significantly, beyond the benefits achieved by acyclovir alone, in reducing prolonged pain . . . the addition of the corticosteroid [to antiviral therapy] did have beneficial effects on acute pain and some cutaneous end points in both of these trials; in one of the trials, the times to uninterrupted sleep, return to normal daily activity, and cessation of analgesic therapy were all significantly accelerated in patients who received combination therapy. Individuals with contraindications to the use of corticosteroids, including hypertension, diabetes, and peptic ulcer disease, were excluded from these studies. Nevertheless, adverse effects of corticosteroids were reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, edema, and granulocytosis." (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>: p. S13. Quoted trials: <LINK REF="REF-Whitley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1994</LINK> [Note: both including patients with all forms of acute herpes zoster infection and not only those with Ramsay Hunt syndrome]).</P>
<P>In the case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Dworkin goes on to state that &#8220;Corticosteroids can be considered as soon as possible after diagnosis for patients with at least moderately severe pain and no contraindications. In addition, corticosteroids should be considered for patients with VZV-induced facial paralysis and cranial polyneuritis to improve motor outcomes, peripheral nerve damage from foraminal compression, or evidence of CNS [central nervous system] involvement, although the benefit of such treatment has not been systematically studied. Contraindications (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, gastritis, osteoporosis, and psychosis) and risks associated with the use of corticosteroids must be carefully evaluated. Treatment with corticosteroids should be initiated only in combination with antiviral therapy" (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>: S17).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Corticosteroids - side effects</HEADING>
<P>Prolonged use or overdose of corticosteroids may exaggerate their physiological action, leading to a broad range of unwanted side effects including adrenal gland suppression and atrophy, fluid and electrolyte impairment, endocrine disturbances, gastrointestinal disorders, dermatologic and musculoskeletal dysfunctions, neurological disorders (e.g. convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilloedema, vertigo, headache), and psychiatric disorders (e.g. euphoria, depression, mania).  Most side effects from steroid use are dose- and length of treatment-dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lampee-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampee 1986</LINK>), and it is generally accepted that corticosteroid use should be limited to a duration of 7 to 10 days. There is very little information in the medical literature on the side effects of short courses of steroid treatment in either normal people or those with diabetes, hypertension or peptic ulceration (conditions in caution is traditionally advised when considering the use of steroids). This absence of information leads to difficulties when trying to weigh any potential benefits of treatment against risks.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the potential (but unquantified) risk of adverse effects associated with short courses of steroids, some patients in the UK and elsewhere with Ramsay Hunt syndrome are currently being prescribed corticosteroids in combination with antiviral therapy.  For example, the German Dermatology Society (DDG) guidelines for the treatment of herpes zoster oticus with or without facial palsy recommend "high dose antiviral therapy (intravenously preferred) [within 72 hours of onset] in combination with glucocorticoids" (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2003</LINK>: p. 285). However, the evidence base for corticosteroids as adjuvant to antiviral therapy for Ramsay Hunt syndrome remains unclear. We found no randomised controlled trial of corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy.</P>
<P>The aim of the review was to evaluate whether the use of steroids as an adjuvant to antiviral therapy improves outcomes in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.</P>

<P>Data from studies will be independently extracted by two groups of authors using standardised data forms. Data will be extracted so as to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Where data are missing, the authors will write to the authors of the study requesting the missing data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The quality of all trials will be assessed and graded independently by two authors according to the criteria described in The Cochrane Handbook 4.2.6 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Gradings will be compared and any inconsistencies between the authors in the interpretation of inclusion criteria and their significance to the selected studies will be discussed and resolved.</P>
<P>The selected studies will be assessed for the following characteristics:</P>
<P>1. The adequacy of the randomisation process (possible selection bias). Adequate randomisation includes any one of the following methods: computer generated or table of random numbers, drawing of lots, coin-toss, shuffling cards or throw of a dice. Inadequate methods of randomisation include the following: case record number, date of birth or alternate numbers.</P>
<P>2. The adequacy of the allocation concealment (possible selection bias). Adequate methods of allocation concealment include either central randomisation (i.e. separate to other aspects of trial administration) or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. Inadequate concealment means an open allocation sequence in which either participants or trialists were able to foresee the upcoming assignment.</P>
<P>3. The blinding of outcome assessors (i.e. whether the persons assessing the outcome of care were aware of which treatment the participant had received - possible performance bias).</P>
<P>4. The extent and handling of losses to follow up (possible attrition bias). Adequate handling of losses to follow up involves a clear description and explanation being given of any significant difference between the losses of the intervention groups. An unacceptable loss in any one intervention group was considered to be loss greater than 20%.</P>
<P>A: Minimisation of bias in all four categories above i.e. adequate randomisation, few losses to follow up and intention-to-treat analysis, blinding of outcome assessors, high quality outcome assessment;<BR/>B: Each of the criteria in A partially met;<BR/>C: One or more of the criteria in A not met.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We intend to perform a meta-analysis if appropriate data are available. Our primary measure of treatment effect is dichotomous (presence or otherwise of complete recovery of facial palsy at six months) and the risk ratio (RR) of this will be determined for each included study. Data will be analysed by intention-to-treat (ITT). Sensitivity analyses will be performed in which we will assume that 1) all missing participants failed to recover and 2) all missing participants recovered completely. The Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method will be used for the meta-analysis and the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic used to investigate heterogeneity.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:05:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>We did not identify any randomised controlled trials that assess the effects of using corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral treatment in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Oral corticosteroids are cheap and widely available. If they were entirely harmless and free of adverse effects it might be possible to argue in favour of their use in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, even in the absence of evidence of effectiveness. The key question in these circumstances is this: are they risk free? It is surprising how difficult we have found it to locate any information about the side effects of short courses of steroids, despite extensive searches. Purely anecdotal evidence suggests that dysphoria is not uncommon. Very few medications, if any, are entirely free of risk. Better quality information is needed if short courses of steroids are to be prescribed in situations where evidence of effectiveness is lacking (on the basis of no, or an inadequate number of, studies) but where it is not unreasonable to postulate a beneficial clinical action based on sound pharmacological principles.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-04-25 20:41:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Carolyn Doree">
<P>There are no randomised controlled trials to support the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral treatment in Ramsay Hunt Syndrome to date.  Their continued use in this condition is only justifiable if the current uncertainty about the nature and incidence of the adverse effects of short courses of steroids can be satisfactorily addressed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-04-25 16:36:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness or otherwise of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral treatment in Ramsay Hunt syndrome could best be addressed by a double blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of a short course of oral steroids. Appropriate outcome measures would include the proportions of patients with complete recovery, motor synkinesis, autonomic dysfunction and persistent vestibular or cochlear symptoms at six months. It is equally important that data are collected concerning the adverse effects of such short courses of steroids in both 'normal' individuals and those in whom longer courses of steroids are usually (relatively) contraindicated. These data are unlikely to come from randomised controlled trials and population-based studies may be necessary.</P>
