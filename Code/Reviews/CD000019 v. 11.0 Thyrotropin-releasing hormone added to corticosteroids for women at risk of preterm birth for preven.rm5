<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-31 09:46:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given with corticosteroids does not improve the benefit of corticosteroids on the lungs of babies born too early, and may increase harm.</P>
<P>Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are at risk of breathing difficulties (such as respiratory distress syndrome). TRH increases thyroid hormones in the baby and it has been thought that adding TRH to corticosteroids for women giving birth early may increase the benefit of corticosteroids on the baby's lungs.</P>
<P>This review included 15 trials, of a moderate risk of bias, that involved over 4600 women and their babies. In this review, TRH, given with corticosteroids to women at risk of early birth, was not shown to further reduce the breathing difficulties for the babies. Babies born to mothers who had received TRH with corticosteroids, were more likely to require support for breathing than babies born to mothers who received only corticosteroids. Women receiving TRH were more likely to experience adverse side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and flushing than women who only received corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Therefore, based on the current available evidence, TRH is not recommended to be given to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-01 16:23:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over 4600 women were recruited into the 15 trials included in the review, however two trials did not contribute any outcome data to the review. The trials had a moderate risk of bias. Overall, prenatal TRH, in addition to corticosteroids, did not reduce the risk of death prior to hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.27, six trials, 3694 infants), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22, nine trials, 3833 infants), or chronic lung disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19, five trials, 2511 infants), and did not improve any of the secondary fetal, neonatal or childhood outcomes assessed by intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
<P>Indeed, the data showed prenatal TRH to have adverse effects for women and their infants. All side effects reported (nausea, vomiting, light headedness, urgency of micturition, facial flushing) were significantly more likely to occur in women receiving TRH. In the infants, prenatal TRH increased the risk of needing respiratory support (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, three trials, 1969 infants), and of having a low Apgar score at five minutes (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.92, three trials, 1969 infants). Only three trials provided data on childhood follow-up, and while one trial suggested poorer outcomes for infants who were exposed to prenatal TRH, the other two trials, that assessed infants using an established developmental instrument, showed no clear differences between groups in follow-up outcomes.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses by trial quality, or subgroups with differing times from entry to birth, or different dose regimens of TRH, did not change these findings.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-19 17:17:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-05 09:03:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth remains the leading cause of early neonatal death and infant mortality, often from respiratory distress syndrome as a consequence of immature lung development (<LINK REF="REF-Nassar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nassar 2001</LINK>). Between 5% and 9% of pregnant women will give birth before 37 weeks' gestation, with higher rates in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012</LINK>). Preterm babies who survive the early weeks of life are at risk of long-term neurological disability (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serenius-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serenius 2013</LINK>). Parents are understandably worried and distressed when their baby is born preterm. Strategies to reduce the risk of preterm birth and, in particular, neonatal respiratory disease receive considerable attention (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first report of a trial of prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given with antenatal corticosteroids to women threatening to give birth preterm with the aim of enhancing lung development was presented, in abstract form, by Liggins and his co-workers in 1988 (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1988</LINK>). The rationale for the use of TRH was based on previous research by Liggins' group (<LINK REF="REF-Schellenberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schellenberg 1988</LINK>). In an elegant series of experiments in preterm lambs they showed both an increase in lung fluid phospholipids and an increase in lung distensibility when thyroid hormones were used in combination with corticosteroids. TRH and glucocorticoids showed similar synergism (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) given antenatally to the mother do not readily reach the fetal circulation due to metabolism by the placenta and membranes. However, TRH given to the mother elevates thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones concentrations in the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Roti-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roti 1981</LINK>). The exact action of TRH on the fetal lung is not known and it is possible that any action may be mediated via non-hormonal pathways.</P>
<P>In adults, intravenous TRH administration is associated with side effects, which are often transient, of nausea, vomiting, light headedness, facial flushing, metallic taste, and a rise in blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the initial abstract reported by <LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1988</LINK>, the use of prenatal TRH as an intervention strategy to reduce the risk of neonatal lung disease and its sequelae has been evaluated in several randomised trials.</P>
<P>This review updates a previously published Cochrane review on TRH added to corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2004</LINK>). The previous version of this review was able to include 13 trials, and concluded that prenatal TRH in addition to corticosteroids does not improve infants outcomes, and can be associated with maternal side effects.</P>
<P>This review assesses the current available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of prenatal TRH given in addition to corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009021.pub2/full#CD009021-bbs2-0053">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009021.pub2/full#CD009021-sec3-0022">Sensitivity analysis</A>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion. In future updates of this review, if we identify cluster-randomised trials, we plan to include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-11-07 10:00:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary has been treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials.</P>
<P>Where we used random-effects analyses, we have presented the results as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of  Tau² and I².</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-11-07 10:01:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis.</P>
<P>We planned subgroup analyses to examine separately the primary outcomes for infants based on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the reasons the women were considered at risk of preterm birth;</LI>
<LI>the number of infants <I>in utero</I> (singleton, twins or higher order multiple pregnancy);</LI>
<LI>the gestational age TRH treatment was given;</LI>
<LI>the dose of TRH given;</LI>
<LI>the outcome for optimally treated infants, which was variously defined by the authors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These analyses were only possible for the dose of TRH given, and the outcome for optimally treated infants.</P>
<P>The greatest beneficial effect of antenatal corticosteroids was observed in the group of infants delivered 24 hours or more and 10 days or less after start of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972</LINK>). An expectation that this may be the case for the combination of prenatal TRH and corticosteroids prompted the secondary timed analysis as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>birth less than 24 hours after first dose;</LI>
<LI>birth between 24 hours and 10 days, inclusive, after first dose;</LI>
<LI>birth more than 10 days after first dose.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-05 09:06:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review does not show that prenatal administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), in addition to corticosteroids, prior to preterm birth reduces the risk of respiratory disease in infants born preterm, or reduces other infant morbidity or mortality. Indeed the data show that this treatment may have adverse effects for women and their infants. All maternal side effects reported in the included trials (nausea, vomiting, light headedness, urgency of micturition, facial flushing) were more likely to occur in women receiving TRH, although their clinical significance and women's perceptions of their importance have not been assessed. For the infants, prenatal TRH increased the risk of infants needing respiratory support, and of having a low Apgar score at five minutes.</P>
<P>In one of the three trials with follow-up data, prenatal TRH was associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood (such as motor and social delay, and motor and sensory impairment) (<LINK REF="STD-ACTOBAT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ACTOBAT 1995</LINK>). However, the other two trials that assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up using an established developmental instrument (Bayley Infant Scales) (<LINK REF="STD-Chile-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chile 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Europe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Europe 1999</LINK>), did not show any significant differences between groups on follow-up, apart from a significantly lower (worse) Mental Developmental Index for infants exposed to prenatal TRH at 24-month follow-up in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Europe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Europe 1999</LINK>), which was not confirmed in the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chile-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chile 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first two full trial reports published showed promising therapeutic effects of prenatal TRH, but reported neonatal outcome data only in minority subgroups of babies entered into the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morales-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 1989</LINK>). However, a significant proportion of babies in all of the studies (49%) were born more than 10 days after trial entry. The data in this review show that these babies (born more than 10 days after trial entry), if exposed to prenatal TRH in addition to corticosteroids, were more likely to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) compared with babies in the control group, who received only corticosteroids. This highlights the importance of 'intention-to-treat' analyses, and subgroup analyses in this review, since many of the studies excluded categories of babies. Even where data were available for all women who were randomised, results from subgroup analyses (e.g. by timing of treatment) are less reliable than overall analyses. However, it is important to show the data by subgroups since timing of treatment appears to be an important consideration.</P>
<P>The expectation was that the greatest beneficial effect of prenatal TRH would be seen in infants born between 24 hours and 10 days of trial entry as shown with antenatal corticosteroids alone (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972</LINK>). Infants exposed to TRH in this timed subgroup, and a similar 'optimal' timing subgroup, did show a reduced risk of severe RDS; however, subgroup interaction tests were not significant, and therefore no firm conclusion could be made regarding this particular group of infants. Intention-to-treat data for severe RDS were only available from three earlier trials for this timed subgroup (birth more than 24 hours and less than 10 days after first dose) (<LINK REF="STD-ACTOBAT-1995" TYPE="STUDY">ACTOBAT 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1994</LINK>) and thus it would be important to include any further data on severe RDS from the more recent trials if they became available.</P>

<P>In the light of the evidence reviewed, no further randomised controlled trials are warranted.</P>
<P>Given the trend to adverse neonatal findings in babies who were born 10 days or more after trial entry, trials should aim to provide outcome and follow-up data on all babies recruited. Those trials that reported data on only minority subgroups of babies should consider retrieving outcome data on the other babies, in particular on mortality and longer-term morbidity.</P>
<P>Adverse maternal side effects of therapy were significant for women receiving prenatal TRH. The duration of the adverse effects, their clinical significance and the consumers' feelings about these have not been assessed.</P>
