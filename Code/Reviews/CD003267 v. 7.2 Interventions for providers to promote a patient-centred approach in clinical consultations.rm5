<P>
<B>Conclusions changed</B>
</P>
<P>Authors of the original review concluded there was some support for impact of Interventions to promote patient-centred care (PCC) within clinical consultations to effect consultation processes and satisfaction, but little data on health behaviours or health status. The update confirms the impact of interventions on consultation processes (qualitative and moderate quantitative effect). We documented moderate qualitative effects on patient satisfaction and small to moderate effects in the quantitative analysis. Health behaviours and health status are more frequently measured in studies in the update. However, they show mixed effects on patient specific outcomes within the study windows reported. Effect size on health behaviour could not be estimated from included studies. Improving patient health behaviour and outcomes appears to require integrating strategies directed at patients and providers as well as strategies that target specific conditions.</P>

<LI>we modified the 'health behavior' category to be more consistent with measures of behaviours found in studies in the original review,</LI>

<LI>the distinction between interventions provided by providers versus research staff has been dropped.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-08 09:44:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Problems may arise when healthcare providers focus on managing diseases rather than on people and their health problems. Patient-centred approaches to care delivery in the patient encounter are increasingly advocated by consumers and clinicians and incorporated into training for healthcare providers. We updated a 2001 systematic review of the effects of these training interventions for healthcare providers that aim to promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations.</P>
<P>We found 29 new randomized trials (up to June 2010), bringing the total of studies included in the review to 43. In most of the studies, training interventions were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners, internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical problems, though two studies included children with asthma.</P>
<P>These studies showed that training providers to improve their ability to share control with patients about topics and decisions addressed in consultations are largely successful in teaching providers new skills. Short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful in this regard as longer training. Results are mixed about whether patients are more satisfied when providers practice these skills. The impact on general health is also mixed, although the limited data that could be pooled showed small positive effects on health status. Patients' specific health behaviours show improvement in the small number of studies where interventions use provider training combined with condition-specific educational materials and/or training for patients, such as teaching question-asking during the consultation or medication-taking after the consultation. However, the number of studies is too small to determine which elements of these multi-faceted studies are essential in helping patients change their healthcare behaviours.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-13 14:56:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) from January 2000 to June 2010. The earlier version of this review searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 1999), EMBASE (1985 to December 1999), PsycLIT (1987 to December 1999), CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) and HEALTH STAR (1975 to December 1999). We searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion and contacted study authors to identify other relevant studies. Any study authors who were contacted for further information on their studies were also asked if they were aware of any other published or ongoing studies that would meet our inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-07 11:12:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review, study designs included randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies of interventions for healthcare providers that promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations. In the present update, we were able to limit the studies to randomized controlled trials, thus limiting the likelihood of sampling error. This is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of providers. Patient-centred care was defined as a philosophy of care that encourages: (a) shared control of the consultation, decisions about interventions or management of the health problems with the patient, and/or (b) a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person who has individual preferences situated within social contexts (in contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease). Within our definition, shared treatment decision-making was a sufficient indicator of PCC. The participants were healthcare providers, including those in training.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-02 22:57:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We classified interventions by whether they focused only on training providers or on training providers and patients, with and without condition-specific educational materials. We grouped outcome data from the studies to evaluate both direct effects on patient encounters (consultation process variables) and effects on patient outcomes (satisfaction, healthcare behaviour change, health status). We pooled results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risks (RR) applying a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 09:44:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-three randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 are new in this update. In most of the studies, training interventions were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners, internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical problems, though two studies included children with asthma. Descriptive and pooled analyses showed generally positive effects on consultation processes on a range of measures relating to clarifying patients' concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of empathy; and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them and their concerns as well as their diseases. A new finding for this update is that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful as longer training.</P>
<P>The analyses showed mixed results on satisfaction, behaviour and health status. Studies using complex interventions that focused on providers and patients with condition-specific materials generally showed benefit in health behaviour and satisfaction, as well as consultation processes, with mixed effects on health status. Pooled analysis of the fewer than half of included studies with adequate data suggests moderate beneficial effects from interventions on the consultation process; and mixed effects on behaviour and patient satisfaction, with small positive effects on health status. Risk of bias varied across studies. Studies that focused only on provider behaviour frequently did not collect data on patient outcomes, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about the relative effect of intervention focus on providers compared with providers and patients.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 09:43:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions to promote patient-centred care within clinical consultations are effective across studies in transferring patient-centred skills to providers. However the effects on patient satisfaction, health behaviour and health status are mixed. There is some indication that complex interventions directed at providers and patients that include condition-specific educational materials have beneficial effects on health behaviour and health status, outcomes not assessed in studies reviewed previously. The latter conclusion is tentative at this time and requires more data. The heterogeneity of outcomes, and the use of single item consultation and health behaviour measures limit the strength of the conclusions.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-08 09:43:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-30 11:43:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Communication problems between healthcare providers and patients are common. Various studies have found that many patients are dissatisfied with the quality of the interaction with their healthcare provider. (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ong 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verghese-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verghese 2011</LINK>).Some communication problems have been attributed to the fact that many healthcare providers focus on diseases and their management, rather than on the people, their lives and their health issues.</P>
<P>The concept of 'patient-centred medicine' was introduced into the medical literature in the mid 1950s by Balint, (<LINK REF="REF-Balint-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balint 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balint-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balint 1956</LINK>) who contrasted it with 'illness-centred medicine' (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>). It has its roots within the paradigm of holism, which suggests that people need to be seen in their biopsychosocial entirety (<LINK REF="REF-Henbest-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henbest 1989</LINK>), and draws medical attention to patients' individual identities. More recently, calls for increased patient engagement suggest that providers should draw on patients' identities, concerns and preferences in acting on patient-centeredness in the clinical encounter. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) defined patient-centred care as healthcare that establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients and their families to ensure that providers and systems deliver care that is attentive to the needs, values and preferences of patients. (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2001</LINK>). In their view, this requires mutual, power-sharing relationships that are collaborative and include the "whole person" orientation.</P>
<P>In this growing literature, the meaning of patient-centred healthcare continues to include a set of concepts that are compatible. However, different approaches use different sub-sets of the elements of the approach. This allows "patient-centred" to be defined somewhat differently across studies. The variability of aims is reflected as well in the heterogeneity of outcomes measured. The term patient-centred has, at its core, an approach whereby the provider 'tries to enter the patient&#8217;s world to see illness through the patient&#8217;s eyes' (<LINK REF="REF-McWhinney-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhinney 1989</LINK>). This means that the provider is guided by the patient&#8217;s knowledge, experience (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 1976</LINK>), needs and preferences (<LINK REF="REF-Laine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laine 1996</LINK>), and comes to understand the patient as a unique human being (<LINK REF="REF-Balint-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balint 1969</LINK>). Others (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipkin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipkin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winefield-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winefield 1995</LINK>) have noted the importance of information-giving and shared decision-making in this process. Mead (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2000</LINK>) has proposed a framework with the following dimensions for studying PCC: the biopsychosocial perspective; the 'patient-as-person' - understanding the  personal meaning of the illness for each individual patient; sharing power and responsibility; the therapeutic alliance; and the 'doctor-as-person' - awareness of the influence of the personal qualities and emotion of the doctor on the doctor-patient relationship. Shared decision making advocates focus on the need for clinicians to describe options, elicit patient preferences and agree on next steps in the decision-making process.</P>
<P>Different elements of patient-centred care (PCC) may be differently constructed and valued by different stakeholders, and for different reasons. Some people regard patient-centred care as desirable in its own right, while others see it as a means to particular (and varied) ends. Healthcare providers and healthcare consumers may have varied opinions about which components and which outcomes of patient-centred care are most important. For example, consumers may be more concerned with the extent to which healthcare providers assess consumers' level of knowledge and adjust the consultation accordingly, than with outcomes such as adherence to care plans. The International Alliance of Patients' Organizations, in its declaration on patient-centred healthcare, includes the involvement of patients in health policy and ready access to information (<LINK REF="REF-IAPO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">IAPO 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient-centredness is increasingly being advocated and incorporated into the training of healthcare providers. The growth of interest in training healthcare providers in patient-centred care has occurred despite a relatively poor empirical understanding of the effects of different interventions to promote it. A growing consensus, however, identifies provider-patient communication as a key to achieving patient-centred care. The IOM document specifies as keys that providers use skills and behaviours that promote a relationship in which patients actively participate as partners in healthcare decision making. The US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), beginning in 2012, will require that to obtain licensure, US physicians demonstrate in the examination, skills that foster the doctor-patient relationship; as well as gathering information, providing information, making decisions and supporting emotions (<LINK REF="REF-US-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">US 2012</LINK>). The move toward testing patient-centred care skills in professional education is based on the studies that demonstrate a correlation between effective provider-patient communication and improved patient health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2007</LINK>). This review extends that empirical tradition and updates the 2001 Cochrane review, synthesizing the maturing literature to examine rigorously the effects of PCC across studies.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-26 01:11:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of interventions for healthcare providers that aim to promote a patient-centred approach in clinical consultations.

<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), excluding other study designs that were included in the previous version of this review (controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series). This restriction to RCTs limits the likelihood of sampling error, which is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of providers.</P>

<P>We included studies of all types of healthcare providers, including those training to qualify as healthcare providers.This review focuses primarily on interventions directed at healthcare providers. Some studies, however, combined provider interventions with those given directly to patients. Most assessed some patient outcomes. There were no restrictions on the types of patients for whom outcome data were extracted.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-09 04:02:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any intervention directed at healthcare providers and intended to promote patient-centred care within clinical consultations was considered.</P>
<P>The update maintains the original definition of patient-centred care (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK>), in which shared treatment decision making is a sufficient indicator of patient-centred care. We defined patient-centred care as including the following two main features:</P>
<OL>
<LI>healthcare providers share control of consultations, decisions about interventions or the management of the health problems with patients, and/or</LI>
<LI>healthcare providers focus on the patient as a person, rather than solely on the disease, in consultations.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The review focused on clinical consultations firstly because these are the most usual type of encounters between patients and healthcare providers. Secondly, we wanted to differentiate interventions to promote patient-centred care in the context of clinical healthcare consultations from related interventions that may be intended to promote patient-centred approaches in social support or social care. These interventions are likely to be quite different in terms of their target groups; their outcomes; and their policy implications.</P>
<P>An intervention was included if the description of the intervention was adequate to allow review authors to establish that it aimed to increase the patient-centred behaviours of providers in the clinical consultation. By patient-centred care we mean <I>behaviours</I> that reflect a philosophy of care that encourages</P>
<OL>
<LI>shared control of the consultation, decisions about interventions or management of the health problems with the patient, and/or</LI>
<LI>a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person who has individual preferences situated within social contexts. This is in contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK>), authors assessed the intensity of patient-centredness and teaching/training tactics for each intervention in the included studies using a three point scale (weak, medium, strong), but the review found this scale to be unreliable. In this update, we used a proxy measure of intervention intensity, namely number of hours, dichotomized as Brief Training (&lt; 10 hours) and Extensive Training (<U>&gt;</U> 10 hours).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exclusions</HEADING>
<P>We excluded:</P>
<UL>
<LI>studies that considered cultural, disability, sexuality or other sensitivity training only for healthcare providers. Although sensitivity to these issues may be necessary for patient-centred care, it is not sufficient in itself to constitute patient-centred care according to our definition.</LI>
<LI>studies that evaluated training in psychotherapy or counselling for healthcare providers. Although training in psychotherapy and counselling would meet our inclusion criteria, in psychotherapy and counselling (in contrast to most other healthcare situations), communication between healthcare provider and patient is itself the primary treatment. We therefore excluded studies that evaluated training in psychotherapy or counselling unless they specifically indicated that the training aimed to encourage a more patient-centred approach to psychotherapy or counselling than is usually used.</LI>
<LI>studies that trained healthcare providers to deliver a specific, secondary intervention initiated by the health provider (e.g. advice on a healthy diet or smoking cessation) in a patient-centred manner in clinical consultations, regardless of whether the intervention was related to the primary purpose of the consultation as indicated by the patient or their carer. We only classified interventions as patient-centred if they promoted a patient-centred approach to care that was integrated with the primary purpose of the consultation rather than being a secondary, 'bolt-on' component of it initiated by the healthcare provider.</LI>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-11-07 11:12:43 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>In the pooled analysis, for cluster randomized trials, we reviewed the methods and results reported. If authors used statistical methods that did not account for clustering of observations, we did not meta-analyse these data. If the authors adjusted for clustering, but did not report the value of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), we contacted the authors. Where reported, we used the ICC value to adjust the sample sizes by dividing the actual sample sizes by the design effect factor (DEFF), which was calculated using ICC as DEFF=1+(M-1)ICC, where M is the average cluster size (eg, number of patients nested within clinician) (see Notes section of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, if the studies contained more than two arms, we used pair-wise comparisons of intervention to control.

<P>If the information necessary for meta-analysis was not reported in the article, we attempted to obtain such information from study authors, including ICC as described above. Further, if an article reported the results of analyses that did not compare two trial arms, then we attempted to re-analyse the data to derive between-group comparisons rather than within-group comparisons. We contacted study authors for any information missing in the article that was needed for re-analysis, such as the means and standard deviation of the outcomes in each group rather than mean change scores. If we received no response from authors, then we excluded studies with missing data from meta-analyses (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-29 05:04:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>For groups of outcomes with more than two studies, we assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, and a formal Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of significance. A value of 50% or higher of the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, and P value &gt; 0.1 indicated substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where heterogeneity was substantial, an attempt was made to explore the sources of heterogeneity using the <I>a priori</I> generated list of study characteristics (see <LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK> above). Characteristics included: academic or non-academic setting, country, inclusion of an experiential component, number of hours of experiential training, total number of hours of training, individual randomisation or cluster randomisation, usual care control or sham intervention control, whether the outcome analysed was primary or secondary, whether the analysis followed the intention to treat strategy. We conducted subgroup analyses according to the levels of study characteristics. We also investigated methodological problems with the studies as a potential source of heterogeneity.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-11-07 11:12:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limiting the current update to RCTs allowed us to pool data within categories by conducting meta-analyses of included studies where similar outcome measures were used within categories. Two authors (SJ, AS) pooled results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risks (RR) applying a fixed-effect model. In each outcome category it was important to keep the direction of the effects the same. For example, higher was worse in some categories, such as depression as an indicator of health status. In other categories, higher was better, such as percentage of patients making an appointment as an indicator of outcomes of consultation processes. The direction of the effects in each category of effects is labelled on the plots (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>).</P>
<P>In part due to the inconsistency across categories in the pooled analysis, and because fewer than half of studies could be included in the meta-analysis, we also conducted a descriptive analysis of the whole set of studies according to the four outcome categories. We report a summary of this analysis at <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> and a detailed narrative synthesis at <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>. We summarized the results of the descriptive analysis in terms of the number of studies showing a positive effect out of the number of studies that measured that outcome for each of the categories (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, to maintain one direction within each group of outcomes in meta-analysis (e.g. larger is worse as in anxiety), outcomes with higher scores indicating better outcomes were reverse scored by subtracting the reported means from the scale totals. Where reported, the adjusted estimates and baseline values of the outcomes were recorded.</P>
<P>If reported, one dichotomous and one continuous outcome from each study were included within the four outcome groups: consultation process, satisfaction, health behavior, and health status. If more than one outcome from each group was reported, then the following strategies were implemented to choose one outcome:</P>
<OL>
<LI>primary outcomes were selected over secondary;</LI>
<LI>total scale scores were selected over sub-scale scores; and finally</LI>
<LI>outcomes with median RR or SMD were selected for data synthesis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Each group of outcomes was also described with the median RR and SMD and the number of studies with significant effects. Because many of the studies were cluster randomized trials, and ICCs were not available in the articles or after contacting the authors, the number of studies in each outcome subgroup was small. This issue and few studies with the number of hours of training reported prevented the implementation of the dose response meta-regression. Subgroup analyses according to the dichotomous study characteristics shed light on the association between these study characteristics and the magnitude of the intervention effect.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions and comparisons</HEADING>
<P>The interventions involved training related to a variety of skills, using diverse teaching techniques and lengths of training. Some used placebo controls and some used pure usual care, as noted in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Aims of the interventions ranged from improving patient centeredness as a primary goal to improving health behaviour of patients and/or effectiveness of providers in managing medical problems. Studies focused always on providers, by definition. However, the addition in some studies of decision aids and patient education materials (both general and condition-specific) and patient training suggested that interventions have become more complex, and directed to both the provider and the patient sides of the encounter. While none of the studies included in <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK> described shared decision making as an aim, four in the current review did aim to improve shared decision making (<LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>).</P>

In other studies, specialists were also trained. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Alder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alder 2007</LINK> trained only obstetricians and gynaecologists. <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fallowfield-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fallowfield 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Merckaert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Merckaert 2008</LINK> trained medical, radiation, and/or surgical oncologists at specialty cancer centres.

The clinical experience of providers varied both within and across studies, ranging from medical students with five years of medical education to providers with more than 20 years of clinical experience. The study sample sizes also varied from 8 to 41 practices in the nine studies randomized by practice, and 4 to 172 providers in the 31 studies that randomized by providers. One study that randomized 30 CME insurance groups did not provide the number of practices and/or providers included (<LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>).</P>

Although the potential unit of analysis error was not explicitly acknowledged in <LINK REF="STD-Hobma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hobma 2006</LINK>, practices were stratified by possible effect modifiers identified by a panel of experts. Clustering is potentially a problem for those studies that randomized providers, due to the clustering effects that cannot be eliminated for patient-level outcomes. However, when we describe cluster randomized trials in this review, we refer to those that randomized practices.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological issues in pooled results</HEADING>
<P>Studies used a variety of measures in all four main outcome categories (consultation process, satisfaction, health behavior, health status). This made pooling results challenging.</P>
<P>Of the 43 included studies, 22 were cluster-randomized trials. In these studies, for some of the outcomes the unit of randomisation was the same as the unit of analysis, necessitating no adjustment of the sample sizes due to a design effect. Examples of such outcomes include the mean percent of patients whose distress was recognized by a physician, or the mean frequency of using particular types of questions by a physician during patient visits. For other outcomes, the unit of analysis differed from the unit of randomisation, and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was needed to adjust the sample sizes for the design effect. Such outcomes included the health status of patients treated by a physician when physicians were randomized to receive the intervention. Notably, only five (<LINK REF="STD-Chenoweth-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chenoweth 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>) out of the 22 studies had the ICC reported. In four additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harmsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harmsen 2005</LINK>), ICCs were estimated for sample size calculations. Because the ICC was not reported in other relevant articles, and was not provided by authors after email inquiry, we excluded some outcomes from the meta-analyses. The specific numbers of outcomes from studies included are shown in the summary of analyses of each group of outcomes (see '<LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>'; and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.)</P>
<P>Other methodological problems related to risk for bias were lack of random selection of the patients when physician-directed programs were evaluated, risk of contamination between study groups, and within group as opposed to between group analyses ('<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>'; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).<B> </B>
</P>
<P>In the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table (Notes field) we show both the unadjusted sample sizes, ICC used for calculation, DEFF, and adjusted sample sizes. As seen from the table, the values of ICC differ from study to study. When a value of ICC was not reported for a particular outcome, we used values reported for other outcomes (or their median) if reported in the same paper (for the same study). However, using ICC from another unrelated study was not judged appropriate; it would be unclear which value of ICC to use from a fairly wide range.</P>
<P>We did not undertake sensitivity analysis according to the absence of reported ICCs. Given the number of studies and the amount of missing data, results would be questionable. In summary, we chose a conservative approach. Where any ICC was mentioned in the paper, it was used, and we decided against using some arbitrary values in the absence of any information.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pooled results by outcome category</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Summary: </B>Outcomes measured varied across studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), with most measuring some aspect of consultation skills and behaviour (29 studies). Other outcomes included patient-centred actions in the consultation, impact on the provider-patient relationship, and impact on the consultation itself (usually duration). The studies in the pooled analysis showed mixed results. <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> Sixteen studies included in the pooled analyses reported a consultation process outcome. The majority of studies measured consultation skills or behaviours In the 4 studies that used dichotomous variables, the pooled analysis showed no effect (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.82 to 1.13) due largely to the influence of the negative <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK> study, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, whereas the pooled analysis of the 12 of 16 studies using continuous variables favoured the intervention (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82) <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>. This is consistent with the descriptive analysis where three-quarters of studies assessing consultation processes showed positive results with the remaining quarter indicating no effect or negative results.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was substantial among the four studies using dichotomous variables (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%), which was not explained by risk of bias, country of origin, type of centre (academic versus non-academic), or number of hours of training. <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> There was moderate heterogeneity across the12 studies reporting continuous outcomes (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis revealed that <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK> was the major source of heterogeneity and I<SUP>2</SUP> was reduced to 46% when this study was removed from the analysis. It had a unique a methodological issue whereby of several videotapes of patient visits, intervention nurses selected tapes to be assessed for quality of consultation process. Lack of random selection in the evaluation of the outcomes has a potential for over-optimistic estimates of the intervention effect. The SMD estimate from this study (1.12) was the largest in this group of outcomes. The other major source of heterogeneity was <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> (SMD -0.18; ie. the point estimate favoured the control group). Exclusion of this study reduced I<SUP>2</SUP> to 49%; and exclusion of both <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> reduced I<SUP>2</SUP> to 30%. None of the other studies contributed significantly to heterogeneity. With <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> excluded, the combined effect of heterogeneity was slightly reduced, but still remained significant. Review of risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), geographic location, or academic centre status did not reveal any consistent patterns of association with heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Consultation process improvement was by far the most consistent finding generated by patient-centred care training for providers. The exception in the pooled analysis of dichotomous variables, as noted above was due to one large study. It is difficult to identify the difference in approach to training that may account for this large outlier. We also examined the impact of length of training (brief or extensive training). Pooled analysis of both brief training (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) and extensive training (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.71) <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) favoured the interventions. While the brief/extensive training variable was dichotomized at 10 hours of training, the extensive training interventions were all greater than 18 hours.</P>

<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Summary: </B>Patient satisfaction favoured PCC interventions across the 11 studies included in the analysis of this outcome, although this outcome was just insignificant in the pooled result of the four studies that used dichotomous measures (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> ).The pooled result of the seven studies that used continuous measures significantly favoured the intervention (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Again there was substantial heterogeneity for those studies using dichotomous outcomes ( I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In studies with continuous outcomes there was low to moderate heterogeneity ( I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%) <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> made had the largest contribution to the overall effect (SMD 0.91, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.38) and contributed all heterogeneity in this group of studies, as reflected in reduction of I<SUP>2</SUP> to 0% when it was excluded. Sensitivity analysis without  <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> reduced the effect (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.44). Here also, review of risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), geographic location, or academic centre status did not reveal any consistent patterns of association with heterogeneity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category C: Healthcare behaviour</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary: </B>The<B> </B>effects of PCC interventions on health behaviour were mixed across the seven studies included in the analysis of this outcome. The pooled results of the four studies using dichotomous measures favoured the intervention (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.38) <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, while the pooled results from the three studies using continuous measures showed no effect (SMD -0.04 (95% CI -0.28 to 0.20, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was substantial across all studies as reflected by I<SUP>2</SUP> of 94% for those with dichotomous outcome measures and 87% for those with continuous outcome measures.</P>
<P>We used sensitivity analyses of the dichotomous health behaviour outcomes to explore <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK> as a potential source of heterogeneity. However, I<SUP>2</SUP> decreased only to 91% without it. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK> had the fewest risks of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and the total training time for provider (nurses) was 84 hours. This intensive training was followed by twelve 20-minute sessions of personal contact of providers with patients supplemented with ad-hoc telephone contacts. In contrast, providers (physicians) were trained for a total of 2 hours in one session in <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; and 3 hours in one session in <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2004</LINK> and 6 hours in Briel. Thus, intensity of training may be an important factor in the effect of intervention on health behaviour outcomes. Two studies with smaller effect sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>) trained providers only, while the two studies with larger effect sizes involved training of both providers and patients.</P>
<P>Of the three studies with continuous outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> accounted for all the heterogeneity, as demonstrated by I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% with <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> excluded. The difference between Loh and the other two studies may be best explained by the types of behavioural outcomes measured. <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> investigated information seeking among participants (intervention patients were more likely to seek information), while in <LINK REF="STD-Joos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>, looked at compliance with medication and hospitalisation respectively (control patients achieved higher rates). It could be argued that seeking information is a simpler behaviour to achieve than compliance. <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> had the best risk of bias profile of the three studies with continuous outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). However, it is not clear whether length of training was an important factor here. Two of the three studies had less than 10 hours of training but as the length of training was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>, we could not explore the impact of training length further. All three studies involved intervention for both providers and patients. With <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> excluded from the analysis, the combined effect on continuous health behaviour outcomes <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>favoured the control group <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK> (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.09).</P>

<B>Summary: </B>Health status improvements favoured the intervention across the 10 studies included in the analysis of this outcome, including both studies using dichotomous measures and the eight studies using continuous measures.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of the effect was 1.36 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.83, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and for continuous outcomes, the estimate of the effect was SMD -0.25 (95% CI -0.36 to -0.15,<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK> ).One additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2004</LINK>) reported no significant differences between intervention and control groups for diabetes-specific quality of life, but reported point estimates and standard deviations inconsistent with this finding. We could not clarify this inconsistency, so this study was not included in <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>. We believe this approach was reasonable since this sole aberrant effect was related to a secondary outcome.  Heterogeneity was not significant as shown by I<SUP>2</SUP> of 0% for dichotomous and continuous outcomes. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of descriptive results by intervention category</HEADING>
<P>The types of outcomes assessed by each of the included studies varied partly in accordance with the aim and nature of the intervention(s) evaluated and the associated outcome measure. Where large numbers of outcomes were measured in one category, we chose to present key results, either those identified by the study authors or those most consistent with our definition of patient-centred care. Not all results could be included in the meta-analysis so a narrative analysis was also conducted. The results of this section are also summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and reported in detail in <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>Overall 35 studies assessed consultation processes (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), 16 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Results were largely positive across all four categories of interventions (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). Eighty percent of studies assessing a consultation process outcome reported a positive result for the intervention(s).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcome category B: Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>The effect of PCC interventions on patient satisfaction was modest across all four categories of interventions in the 43 studies that assessed this outcome (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). While the pooled analysis of 11 out of 43 studies shows positive effects for continuous measures and no effect for dichotomous measures, descriptive results are less clear. Where providers only were trained in communication skills, fewer than half (6 of 13 studies or 40%) showed positive effects on satisfaction. Where both providers and patients were trained in communication, only one of the four studies (25%) showed positive results. Where providers were trained in communication skills and provided with condition-specific content two of five studies (40%) showed positive effects. Where providers and patients were additionally provided with condition-specific training (CST) materials three out of four studies (75%) showed positive effects on satisfaction. See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcome category C: Healthcare behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Patient healthcare behavior was the least frequently measured outcome (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Seventeen studies measured health behavior, with 8 showing positive results. In the pooled analyses, four studies using dichotomous measures showed a positive effect, while the three using continuous measures did not. In regard to health behaviour change, results varied by the intervention type. In the four studies where providers only were trained in communication, only one (25%) showed a positive effect. Neither of the two studies that trained providers and patients in communication showed a positive effect on behavior. For studies where condition-specific materials were added, the effects on behaviour were different. In the six studies where providers were trained and provided with condition-specific content, 4 showed positive effects on patient behaviour. In an additional five studies, both providers and patients were trained in communication and also provided with condition-specific materials. In these, three studies showed positive effects on patient behaviour. Overall, seven out of the eleven studies (65%) using condition-specific materials showed an impact on patient behavior. This contrasts with only one of the six studies that did not include condition-specific materials (17%). See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for more detail.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcome category D: Health status</HEADING>
<P>Health status was measured in 26 studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>), with a positive effect shown in 12. The pooled analyses of 10 studies show positive effects for both dichotomous measures and continuous outcome measures, though only 46% of the total group showed positive effects on health status. See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Further descriptive detail presented at <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> shows the heterogeneity, and rich diversity of approaches to teaching providers to improve patient-centred care skills, with and without added support by training patients and providing condition-specific information.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-07 11:10:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The addition of 29 trials in this updated review supports the conclusion of the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK>) that interventions for providers to improve patient-centred care (PCC) skills are largely successful in transferring new skills to providers. This review adds that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful as longer training. Both were successful in the interval evaluated. This finding held across numerous settings and countries, and with a wide variety of trainers and trainees. PCC skills in the consultation were assessed by video or audiotape in about half of the studies and by patient or physician questionnaires in the rest. Descriptive analysis of simple counts of studies with any positive result suggested that interventions were effective in transferring PCC skills to providers in all the intervention groups. This observation was supported by quantitative analysis of studies that measured continuous outcomes. (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>This update strengthens somewhat the case that improved PCC skills results in improved patient satisfaction, in that pooled analysis of continuous measures shows positive results. However, dichotomous measures show no effect, and among all studies, only 12 out of 26 show positive effects on patient satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the earlier review, there were not enough studies to evaluate the effects of the interventions on patient health behaviour or on health status. In this update, there are more data on both. Some studies measured patient behaviours that occurred during the consultation process and others measured behaviours that occurred following the encounter such as healthcare utilization, compliance, and lifestyle changes. In terms of health status, and perhaps health behaviours, there is modest support for the observation that multi-faceted interventions have an effect that is not found with training for providers only. In only one of the studies that focused only on providers was an impact on health behaviour or health status found. However, in each of the other types of interventions, some effect was seen. In the quantitative analyses, studies that measured health behaviour were mixed, depending on whether continuous or dichotomous outcomes were measured, although studies that measured health status and satisfaction showed consistent benefits. The combined estimate of effect of interventions on patient satisfaction, health behavior and health status were in the low to medium range. This trend is discernable, despite the vast heterogeneity of study designs, and particularly of study outcomes. Studies were undertaken largely in chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, depression, and heart disease. Outcome measures included both disease specific and global measures (see <LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_TABLES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional tables</LINK> 4 to 7). It appears that the interventions tend to change just those outcomes they aimed to change, without any positive spill-over effects to other behaviours such as improving providers&#8217; abilities to listen better or improving relationships with patients. This suggests that the addition of condition-specific materials to provider training is necessary, but not sufficient to produce desired behavior change. The finding that interventions largely achieved their aims suggests that there are techniques available to improve providers' PCC skills and the addition of condition-specific materials (though not general education) will improve behaviour change. More research is needed to directly test the effects of interventions aimed at providers only, compared with those aimed at patients and providers, with and without condition-specific educational materials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-11-07 11:13:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the studies has improved over time. Increased attention to study quality, and improved reporting of outcomes made meta-analysis a reasonable undertaking. However, this update identified a number of other methodological weaknesses. First, studies frequently reported only change scores instead of post-intervention group comparisons and queries to study authors regarding these issues were not answered. Second, many cluster RCTs did not report interclass correlation coefficients. When this occurred, adjustment for clustering was frequently not discussed. No study authors responded to requests for clarification of this issue. This disqualified many studies from meta-analysis and contributed to possible selection bias in the review. In addition selection bias could not be ruled out in the majority of included studies, as randomisation procedures were frequently not adequately described. Third, contamination remains a significant methodologic problem in those studies that randomized patients or providers and may have mitigated intervention effects. Because the nature of the intervention in patient-centred skills training can rarely be concealed from patients or providers, contamination is often a problem. While cluster RCTs are a partial solution, concealment is still a problem. As the science of pragmatic trials develops, new strategies for this problem will likely be developed.</P>
<P>Finally, wide variability persists in the measures used to assess the patient centeredness of consultations, patient satisfaction and global health status. A significant contribution that could be made from improved collaboration among researchers in this field would be the wider use of common outcome measures for consultation processes and health status. Disease-specific measures, of necessity, vary across conditions.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-29 12:54:15 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A strength of the review is the focus on RCTs, which, theoretically, should control for sampling error. However, a limitation of this approach is that it excludes studies with other designs, particularly those undertaken in the context of descriptive healthcare system quality improvement. Further, we identified only published studies, which excludes theses or dissertations. While RCTs are unusual among theses or dissertations, future updates will include this source of scholarship.</P>
<P>Limiting the review to RCTs allowed meta-analysis. However, the large number of studies that could not be included raises questions about the potential for selection bias in our meta-analyses. Heterogeneous outcome measures also limits the pooling of results. Funnel plots suggest less potential for publication bias for continuous outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>) than dichotomous ones (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).</P>
<P>We removed carer satisfaction as an outcome in this update with the exception of pediatric studies, which included parents. Satisfaction among adult carers was excluded due to its rarity in the last review and the problem of its contributing added heterogeneity. Excluding carers might be a source of bias, though it would not be likely to change the mixed results found. </P>
<P>The multiplicity of outcome measures within studies, as well as the heterogeneity, were problematic. When studies measured many PCC skills, the result was often that participants scored positively on some and negatively on other skills, leaving an unclear pattern of overall patient-centeredness. Our descriptive summary (and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) uses the study as the unit of analysis, reporting numbers of positive and negative behaviours by study. This may introduce a positive reporting bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-30 14:39:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review agrees with previous reviews that have shown the effectiveness of interventions in transferring PCC skills to providers (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2007</LINK>). The update improves previous reports by providing effect sizes. It is the first to provide quantitative summaries of intervention effects, and to show the differential benefits of broad categories of interventions. The small effect sizes suggest that the enthusiasm shown in some reviews (eg. <LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2007</LINK>) is appropriate based on the efficacy of training to change provider PCC skills, but that the effect on patient health should be viewed as a separate and, as yet, unproven assertion. We observed that satisfaction and health behaviour change are positively impacted more frequently in the presence of disease-specific materials. This is consistent with the systematic review of decision aids by Stacey and colleagues showing positive effects on satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Planners and deliverers of training</HEADING>
<P>This update confirms the findings of the <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2001</LINK> review that interventions to promote patient-centred care (PCC) are effective in transferring PCC skills to healthcare providers and provides new estimates of effect sizes. Overall, there is fairly strong evidence to suggest that most interventions to promote PCC in the clinical consultation lead to significant increases in the patient-centeredness of consultation processes, as indicated by a range of measures relating to clarifying patients' concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of empathy and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them and their concerns as well as their diseases. Is this sufficient to justify the importance that PCC has taken on in training programs in Europe, the UK, and North America? The answer is yes, if PCC is seen as worthy in its own right. The investment in training, and in observational measures of health professional performance are probably justified because interventions to promote PCC within clinical consultations appear to lead to significant increases in the patient-centeredness of care. The trials included here are dominated by experiments with practicing clinicians and residents/registrars. It may be argued that studies among undergraduate trainees would not be feasible. Designers of undergraduate curricula have gradually adopted PCC approaches, based on the perceived success and importance of this training among practicing clinicians. Once adopted, it would be unethical as well as impractical to deny such training to undergraduate trainees for the sake of a trial. As PCC becomes a mark of quality of care in the United States and other countries, it is anticipated that the field may move from trials of interventions to evidence of competency in patient-centred skills.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Practice of patient-centred care</HEADING>
<P>In the original review, we concluded there was some support for PCC Interventions to impact consultation processes and satisfaction, but little data on health behaviours or health status. Health behaviours and health status were more frequently measured in studies in the update. However, they show mixed effects on patient-specific outcomes. For studies that compared provider training in PCC with no training, the improved patient-centeredness of the consultation did not lead to changes in patient behaviours or in health status outcomes where those were measured. There is some indication that adding explicit patient and/or provider instruction in disease-specific management skills to PCC skills training may improve both health behavior and health status. Effect size on health behaviour could not be estimated from included studies. Improving patient health behaviour and outcomes appears to require integrating strategies directed at patients and providers as well as strategies that target specific conditions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-08 01:21:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the methodological quality of the trials is improving, fewer than half of the studies could be included in the pooled analyses. Interventions generally showed a positive impact on the consultation behaviours taught and assessed, though few studies used the same measure. Measures of patient satisfaction and health status continue to be heterogeneous. In the pooled analyses, continuous measures of both satisfaction and health status show moderate effects, while dichotomous measures show small effects. Patient behaviours and disease-specific measures will remain idiosyncratic to the clinical conditions of interest, which is a rich mix of mental health, chronic disease, screening and treatment choices. We included health service utilization in the category of health behaviours. This, however, is a growing area of concern in an era of limited healthcare resources and should in the future be looked at separately.</P>
<P>The apparent effectiveness of multifaceted interventions brings with it a challenge to identify &#8216;active&#8217; elements of effective complex interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shojania-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shojania 2005</LINK>). Adaptation to different health systems with different goals will be enhanced if such key elements can be identified. Head-to-head comparisons of different configurations of complex interventions to promote PCC would contribute substantially. Ways of involving healthcare consumers in the design, planning and delivery of interventions to promote PCC need to be actively pursued. In particular, the selection of outcomes should focus on measures of outcomes seen as important by consumers for quality of care, as well as by health policy experts.</P>
<P>All the studies reviewed were completed in high-income countries. Interventions to promote PCC may have varying acceptability and impact across different health care and cultural settings. In adapting to low- and middle-income countries, it will be important to develop interventions that may involve different components from training to organisational restructuring. In so doing, it should be anticipated that interventions may impact in different ways on consumer and provider satisfaction across different settings. Although patient-centeredness may be an objective of care in many settings, it is not possible to be confident about the applicability of the reported interventions to low- and middle-income countries. Human resource issues, such as the scarcity of healthcare providers and low motivation to deliver PCC, may limit the feasibility and potential of this approach for improving professional practice and health outcomes.</P>
<P>In thinking broadly about what can be taken from the studies reported here, it is important to take into account the spread of electronic access to information in some areas of the world. It may well be that information resources and training resources can be made available electronically to physicians and community health workers, as opposed to direct person-to-person training, as was done in virtually all of the studies reported here. Broad coalitions of national and international organizations may be helpful in developing resources. A clear need is for trials of interventions to promote PCC in low- and middle-income country settings, and in low-income settings in high-income countries. In addition, future trials should specifically assess the effects of interventions other than healthcare provider training, such as changes in the organisation of care, in promoting PCC in the clinical consultation. In addition, the included studies in this review did not address care teams, and the most efficient and effective set of provider training, patient training and provision of condition-specific educational materials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for health policy</HEADING>
<P>This update strengthens the case for the efficacy of training providers to improve delivery of patient-centred care to improve patient satisfaction. It suggests, though not as strongly, that the addition of condition-specific educational materials supports further improvement in patient-centred care. While further studies are needed, it is reasonable to begin to evaluate effectiveness studies in routine care, and to consider the implications for improved education of providers both in their training, and in post-graduate training and certification. While measurement heterogeneity limits these conclusions somewhat, a strength of these studies is that they employed direct measures of consultation processes. Direct measures of consultation processes are required to demonstrate success of the interventions. Patient and provider satisfaction measures assess the felt impact of the interventions; such self-report measures complement observational measures. The impact, particularly of multi-faceted interventions is promising.</P>

<P>
<B>Aim of study (hypothesis):</B> To assess whether patient-centred consultations are more effective than the usual style of consultation used by experienced general practitioners with patients suffering from benign chronic musculoskeletal pain and fibromyalgia. Also, to evaluate the differential characteristics of these two clinical groups of symptoms. Hypothesis: Patient-centred consultation compared to the conventional treatment would decrease pain by one point on a 10-point visual analogue scale</P>
<P>
<B>Content of intervention:</B> Trainers and doctors identified the presentation of the most common problems in primary care, the importance of psychosocial aspects of health and the general objectives of a consultation. Participating doctors practiced communication skills for establishing an effective relationship, obtaining biopsychosocial information, giving information, negotiating, and closing the interview. Role-play, video examples, and interviews with simulated patients were used. Providers were taught data gathering, relationship building, informing/motivating/shared decision-making, and behaviours and skills could be replicated</P>

<B>Aim of study (Hypothesis): </B>to investigate the effectiveness of PCC and dementia-care mapping compared with each other and with conventional dementia care and to examine whether either intervention can decrease need-driven dementia-compromised behaviours.</P>
<P>
<B>Content of intervention: </B>In PCC group, Bradford University's training manual was used as a resource during and after training sessions. Topics covered included understanding that behaviour is a form of communication, recognising that feelings persist despite cognitive impairment, acknowledging feelings during social interactions, and focusing on the unique way that residents express feelings and needs to change usual care.</P>
<P>In dementia-care mapping: the care-staff were trained by a Bradford-trained expert, and did mapping to identify factors related to resident well-being, and report it to nurses to develop individual care plans for residents by considering individual histories, needs, and preferences.</P>
<P>
<B>Conceptual focus: </B>In PCC group: 1-how staff actions contribute to behaviours of residents that result from dementia.2- emphasising that social interactions, especially those that engage residents on an affective level, help to preserve personhood and build meaningful relationships.</P>
<P>In dementia-care mapping: mapping of composite well being scores for individual residents, associations between care practices and staff-resident interactions, and well being expressions present in need-driven dementia-compromised behaviours.</P>
<P>
<B>Duration and timing: </B>In PCC group: 2 day training session + support via regular telephone contact</P>
<P>In dementia-care mapping: mapping was performed for 6 hours per day for 2 days for each resident</P>

<P>Training was in the form of a self-directed educational package. It aimed to help providers improve their detection of psychological distress in patients (through a process of reflexive learning). It included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Written theoretical material: This included background to the role of reflection in learning and discussed strategies that can improve detection of psychological distress such as: helping people talk/show feelings; expressing empathy for patient/developing rapport; use of facilitative behaviours such as nodding and showing interest; exploring psychosocial aspects; using strategies to cover the patient's agenda.</LI>
<LI>Assessment data on their own performance and that of their peers (from baseline video data collection stage): These data included bar charts showing percentage of cases accurately identified as having psychological distress, and comparing study providers results with 'average' statistics.</LI>
<LI>A checklist to help analyse four of their consultations on video (two patients had been correctly identified as distressed, two had been 'missed'): The checklist was designed to enable providers to reflect on the consultation process and to identify the extent to which they had used certain behaviours.</LI>

<B>Content of intervention:</B>
</P>
<P>The four teaching objectives of the intervention were; to help the patient clarify his/her concerns; to find relevant information; to offer a negotiation process and; to invite patient participation in decision making. Techniques of active listening were taught and providers were encouraged to use PCC communication techniques.<BR/>NB: Providers were instructed to clarify time limits and to announce explicitly a change in the topic and the structure of the communication, e.g., by announcing a shift from a patient-centred phase to a provider centred part.</P>
<P>The intervention consisted of three elements:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Initial 1.5 day seminar (14 hours) to increase awareness of possible shortcomings in provider-patient communication and to allow participants to practice (in small group sessions) alternative communication techniques through role play and the use of simulated patients. Time was devoted to the formulation of individual behaviour goals and participants filled in a goal attainment booklet (<LINK REF="REF-Kiresuk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiresuk 1986</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Six progress assessment meetings (6 x 45 minutes, six to eight months after initial seminar). Behavioural goals are checked six times in small group sessions. Participants discuss difficulties encountered and set new goals or refine existing ones;</LI>
<LI>Six one-to-one preceptor feedback sessions. Participants' behaviour with patients was observed during 6 x 1.5 hrs sessions (either during ward rounds or during interviews with outpatients) and then results were fed back to the participant during a 20 minute session.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The intervention targeted all three participants in the medical interview (provider, parent and child). Each participant viewed a videotape. The three tapes shared four main aims: </P>
<OL>
<LI>To provide an opportunity for thinking about the goals of the visit;</LI>
<LI>To suggest as an important long-term goal the child's involvement as a competent, responsible participant in health care;</LI>
<LI>To model some of the skills needed to achieve this goal; and</LI>
<LI>To provide research evidence suggesting the importance of a child-inclusive model of paediatric communication.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Child videotape - 10 minutes/viewed immediately prior to visit.<BR/>Featured a young boy demonstrating how to communicate effectively during a medical visit. Encouraged children to see themselves as active, thoughtful participants in their own health care and modelled communication and assertiveness skills. After viewing, the children received workbooks to note down questions for providers and any information discussed. Children formulated a question they wanted to ask the provider and practiced telling it to the researcher.</P>
<P>Parent videotape - 10 minutes/viewed just prior to visit.<BR/>Presented vignettes of medical visits which demonstrated effective communication skills for parents. Presented evidence re. importance of provider-patient communication and child involvement in health care, as well as factors that affect children's understanding of medical information.</P>
<P>Provider videotape - 15 minutes/viewed as part of a 1 hour training session (in which they also received research articles on health consequences of effective communication, examples of appropriate interviewing techniques for children, and an acronym designed to remind them of critical interviewing skills).<BR/>Presented research evidence relating to children's understanding of health-related information and the consequences of effective communication . Vignettes were also used to demonstrate a number of provider communication skills, including participating with the parent and child in agenda setting, and facilitating their expression of concerns.<BR/>After each visit with study patient, providers filled out a self-assessment form designed to help them reflect on their performance.<BR/>At three months, eight months, and 15 months after intervention providers received a written reminder of the intervention, data on the reported implementation of each goal and a self-assessment form</P>

<P>Training sessions comprising discussion, demonstration of the technology and often role play. Continuing contact with the practices was achieved by bimonthly newsletters, personal contacts with the research nurse, two group meetings held seven months apart and by being invited to make an audio recording of one or more clinical consultations in which the method was being used.<BR/>The intervention adopted many of the principles of motivational interviewing. It aimed to encourage the provider to negotiate individual care plans that built on the patient's perceptions of their disease and their readiness to change their lifestyles. The core message was that the patient should be allowed to air their personal concerns about their condition, to select which particular topic they felt most relevant for discussion and, if appropriate, to set a specific target for themselves.</P>

<B>Randomization procedure:</B> Randomization was based on a random number sequence, using a computer randomized number generator, and stratified for the 10 course locations? Random allocation was performed by the statistician before the commencement of the study and placed in a sealed envelope, which was kept securely by the administrator within the central research department. On receipt of completed tapes 1 and 2, the nurses were randomized in the order that the tapes arrived at the researcher&#8217;s office. The research coordinator contacted the administrator by telephone to find out allocation</P>

<B>Content of intervention:</B> Providers were introduced to patient-centred communication concepts and communication skills. Skills focused on establishing mutual understanding with patients, understanding frustration and anger, understanding guilt and anxiety, communication to facilitate behavior change, motivational interviewing, and skills for exploring patients&#8217; thoughts, expectations and feelings. They were educated about the purpose of the study, used a scripted preadmission call for making individual care plans. The training included a didactic presentation, role plays, discussion, chances to practice within sessions, encouragement to practice between sessions, and audio visual aids used in teaching.</P>
<P>Intervention group patients were given a pre-admission call where nurses explored the patient&#8217;s current thoughts, expectations, and feelings to establish mutual understanding that included patients concerns, expectations and learning needs into an individualized plan of care. They were asked to identify a care partner of their choice to include in their care plans. They had daily collaboration to review or alter their plan of care.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-two studies examined consultation processes. They reported between one and 30 outcomes that assessed a range of provider and patient verbal, humanistic, and/or empathic behaviours in the consultation. The intervention was superior to the control for at least 1 of the outcomes measured in 16 of the 22 studies that measured consultation process (1 did not measure consultation process <LINK REF="STD-Chassany-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chassany 2006</LINK>). Seven studies assessed providers' videotaped humanistic and empathic behaviours during the consultation process (<LINK REF="STD-Alamo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alamo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alder 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallowfield-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fallowfield 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langewitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Langewitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moral-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moral 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robbins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>). Among these, the only fully negative study was <LINK REF="STD-Alder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alder 2007</LINK>. Six studies assessed physician communication skills with questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Hobma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hobma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Margalit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Margalit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2008</LINK>). Among the survey evaluations, the only fully negative study was <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2008.</LINK> Four studies measured a range of audio- taped providers' consultation behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Heaven-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Heaven 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levinson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Levinson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>). Of these, the only fully negative study was <LINK REF="STD-Levinson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Levinson 1993</LINK>. One study used direct observation (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2008</LINK>) and found the intervention groups had better Objective Structured Clinical Examination scores on assessment of patient perspectives and social factors; basic communication, history taking; and formulation of differential diagnoses.</P>
<P>Rather than assessing communication skills or humanistic behaviours, three studies measured outcomes relating to the providers' ability to detect and/or manage psychological distress in patients (<LINK REF="STD-Howe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Howe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merckaert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Merckaert 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Howe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Howe 1996</LINK> providers in the intervention group were able to detect a greater amount of psychological distress in patients with emotional problems three months after training. <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK> reported 22 outcomes relating to consultation process, with six to eight outcomes being statistically significant for the intervention groups compared to the control groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Merckaert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Merckaert 2008</LINK> mean scores of physicians&#8217; ability to detect cancer patient&#8217;s distress at baseline and 5 months were not significantly different between intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>The final study (<LINK REF="STD-McLean-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2004</LINK>) assessed the effect of intervention on the duration of consultation and found no significant difference between intervention and control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category B: Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen of the 23 studies reported between 1 and 5 outcomes each on patients' satisfaction with aspects of the provider's manner and/or abilities, or with the visit in general. Results were mixed. Six (<LINK REF="STD-Alamo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alamo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langewitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Langewitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK>) studies reported statistically significant benefit in some aspect of patient satisfaction. <LINK REF="STD-Alamo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alamo 2002</LINK> asked patients to rate how satisfied they were with their ability to discuss pain, how clearly the doctor discussed the cause of pain, and how the doctor listened to their opinions and suggestions concerning management, with the intervention group scoring significantly better than the control group in all three areas. <LINK REF="STD-Langewitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Langewitz 1998</LINK>
<B>
<U> </U>
</B>reported that the proportion of patients who stated that they would recommend their doctor to a friend significantly increased in the intervention group following the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2004</LINK> used a validated consultation satisfaction questionnaire with four components: professional care, general satisfaction, depth of relationship, and perceived time. Patients who had acute self-limiting illnesses, were more satisfied (on one measure only &#8211; professional care) when trained GPs were trained (prompted) to ask them about their concerns. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>
<B> </B>reported five patient satisfaction measures of which two showed statistically significant differences. Immediately after their post intervention medical visit, patients in the intervention group had significantly more confidence in their providers' abilities and were generally more satisfied with their medical visits than patients in the control group, although no significant differences between the groups were reported for patients' satisfaction with opportunities to discuss concerns, provider empathy and comparison of provider with others. In <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>, the mean score of intervention patients' satisfaction with doctors' information giving and interpersonal skills was positive for the intervention group. Similarly, mean scores for satisfaction with the consultation were positive in <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The seven remaining studies in this category reported no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for either general satisfaction scores or for specific aspects of patient satisfaction with their provider's manner and/or abilities (<LINK REF="STD-Alder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alder 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merckaert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Merckaert 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moral-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moral 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category C: Health behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Of the four provider training only studies that assessed health behavior (<LINK REF="STD-Alder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Alder 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK>), the only study that showed significant improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>) did not measure patient behaviour directly, but rather used a self-administered questionnaire to assess patients&#8217; confidence in decision-making and their expectation to adhere to negotiated plans. The other three studies did not show benefit. <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1988</LINK> reported on behavioural, medication and appointment adherence, none of which showed any statistically significant changes from before to after the intervention in either the intervention or control group. <LINK REF="STD-Thom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thom 1999</LINK> measured continuity of patient with provider, self-reported adherence to advice or treatment, number of referrals, and number of diagnostic tests ordered. None of these showed any significant differences between the two groups approximately six months after post intervention medical visit. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK> found no significant difference between either of two intervention groups (providers trained in problem defining skills only or providers trained in emotion handling skills only) and the control group for the proportion of emotional distressed patients revisiting providers at two weeks, three months and six months after the post intervention medical visit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category D: Health status</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies assessed one outcome each on health status and well being.

Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alamo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alamo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chenoweth-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chenoweth 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2008</LINK>) showed statistically significant, but clinically modest benefits. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Alamo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alamo 2002</LINK> measured intensity of pain, number of tender points, subjective health status, and depression and anxiety scores at 6 months and 12 months found small, but statistically significant differences in favour of the intervention group in number of tender points and anxiety. There were no significant differences in any of the other comparisons. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Roter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roter 1995</LINK>) measured levels of emotional distress in patients previously identified as having high distress scores. They reported that patients of providers trained in problem defining skills only showed significant reductions in emotional distress at each time point (two weeks, three months, six months from post intervention medical visit) compared with control patients. There was no significant difference in levels of emotional distress for patients of providers trained in emotion handling skills only, compared with control patients. <LINK REF="STD-Chenoweth-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chenoweth 2009</LINK> measured agitation, psychological and psychiatric behaviours, quality of life in end-stage dementia, incidents, falls and antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drug doses in patients with dementia who received person-centred care, dementia-care mapping or no intervention (before intervention, after intervention and at 4 month follow-up). Agitation significantly decreased in both intervention group at follow-up, and the rate of falls at 4 month follow-up significantly decreased in dementia-care mapping group and significantly increased in person-centred care group. The other variables were not significantly different within intervention or control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Longo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merckaert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Merckaert 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2008</LINK> reported no significant differences between the intervention or control groups for general symptom improvement pre- and post- intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>Six of the seven studies assessed consultation processes, including provider behaviours and a range of patient behaviours such as initiating discussion on a topic, responses, information recall and participation in healthcare discussions (<LINK REF="STD-Harmsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harmsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haskard-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Haskard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2005</LINK>). For this category between three and six outcomes were assessed per study; and five out of six studies had at least one significantly positive outcome in favour of intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Harmsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harmsen 2005</LINK> assessed the effect of an intervention given to both physicians and patients on mutual understanding after one and six months. They documented 11% improvement in mutual understanding (and some improvement in perceived quality of care) at 6 months in consultations with non-western patients (P = 0.05), but not with western patients. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Haskard-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Haskard 2008</LINK> reported significant benefit of intervention on all three consultation outcomes measured; and <LINK REF="STD-Joos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 1996</LINK> showed statistically significant differences in two out of three outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-Joos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 1996</LINK> providers in the intervention group elicited patient concerns in a greater proportion of visits than those in the control group; and a higher proportion of patients of intervention providers had favourable perceptions about their medical visit. There was no difference between the intervention and control groups for patients' perceptions of the amount of information given by providers about medications and side effects. <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1991</LINK>, which focused on communication between providers, children and parents, assessed five consultation process measures, of which two showed statistically significant differences, and <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK> reported a higher percentage of intervention patients who affirmed their current behaviour and initiated discussion of change eight to nine months post intervention. However, they found no significant difference in the percentage of patients who were involved in other aspects of the consultation, such as deciding on topics to discuss and target setting. <LINK REF="STD-Song-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2005</LINK> found no difference in the one consultation outcome measured (patients' knowledge of advanced care planning).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category D: Health status</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorlie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sorlie 2007</LINK>) examined aspects of health status and well being, measuring between one and three outcomes for this category. Three of the four studies documented improvement in at least one reported outcome. Intervention patients in <LINK REF="STD-Song-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2005</LINK> reported less difficulty making choices, although patients&#8217; anxiety changes (pre to post) did not significantly differ by group. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Sorlie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sorlie 2007</LINK> found patients in the intervention group to have significantly less anxiety and better subjective health at discharge, although there was no significant difference between intervention and control patients in changes in depression score. <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK> found no benefit of the intervention on any outcome related to health status. <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1991</LINK> measured one outcome - mean levels of anxiety - and showed no statistically significant differences between children in the intervention and control group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention category 3. Training for providers plus condition-specific training</HEADING>
<P>PCC training for providers plus condition- or behaviour-specific training or material for providers and/or patients compared with no training intervention was evaluated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK>) and with behaviour-specific material for providers only in four (<LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chassany-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chassany 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK> also had a non-randomized control group with no training intervention, but we did not consider comparisons with this group for this review.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>Two of the seven studies in this intervention category assessed two and eight consultation process outcomes respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK>). Both found at least one significant outcome in favour of the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK> used two independent questionnaires to assess the consultation process from the perspectives of both patients and their physicians. Patients&#8217; appraisal of the quality of the consultation process was higher than control patients&#8217; at baseline, 3 months and 1 year. Similarly, providers in the intervention group stated interaction with their patients to be less difficult than did providers in the control group; and the difference between the two groups regarding the difficulty of the provider-patient interaction remained constant over time. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK> showed that parents in the intervention group were more likely than parents in the control group to report that the paediatrician was reassuring, encouraging and reassuring two months after the post intervention medical visit. However, no statistically significant differences were found between intervention and control group parents in confidence about managing asthma at home (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category B: Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Five of the seven studies assessed between one and five outcomes on patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK>). Two of them documented at least one positive effect of intervention. Intervention patients in <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK> reported better satisfaction with their decisions, but there was no difference on their decisional conflict scales. The study did not assess patient satisfaction with their physicians or with their care. <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; found no significant differences between trained and untrained providers in patients&#8217; self-reported satisfaction with initial consultation. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK> found no significant difference between intervention and control in the five outcomes they assessed on patient satisfaction. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK> reported significant improvement in patient satisfaction at 6 months and 12 months in intervention patients compared with control patients, although they did not report the actual satisfaction scores.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category C: Health behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Six of the seven studies assessed between one and seven outcomes on healthcare behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK>); and four out of these six reported at least one positive outcome of intervention. For example, the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK> chose a higher mean number of different treatment modalities for their fibromyalgia than control group. Similarly, two of four outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000</LINK> showed statistically significant differences. According to parent self report, children in the intervention group two months post intervention made significantly fewer non emergency physician office visits and significantly fewer visits following an episode of symptoms, but had no difference in number of emergency department visits or hospitalisations. Intervention patients in <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK> made significantly fewer number of outpatient visits for inflammatory bowel disease, although there was no difference in percentage of patients making more than two visits in one year. In addition, significantly higher percentage of intervention patients made their own appointments. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK> reported higher rates of appropriate antidepressant doses in the intervention group and lower rates of use of controlled substances after 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK> were the only totally negative study in this group. <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK> found no significant benefits of intervention in the three outcomes they assessed on lifestyle behaviours such as exercise and smoking. <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK> found no significant benefit of intervention in re-consultation rates within 14 days of study enrolment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category D: Health status</HEADING>
<P>Six out of the seven studies reported between one and seven outcomes on health status (<LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chassany-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chassany 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK>); and two of the six reported at least one outcome in favour of the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Chassany-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chassany 2006</LINK>, the intervention improved three different measures of pain even after adjustment for higher use of acetaminophen in the intervention group. The intervention also improved stiffness, physical functioning, and global score; and reduced adverse events. Similarly, the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2006</LINK> were more likely to have improved SF-36 mental component summary and physical disability scores after 12 months than control patients. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Bieber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bieber 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Meland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meland 1997</LINK> found no significant benefit of the intervention in any of the four outcomes on health status they each reported. The intervention patients in <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2004</LINK> reportedly had a higher number of relapses, but there was no difference in depression, anxiety, or quality of life. There was weak evidence of higher patient enablement in the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Briel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Briel 2006</LINK>. However, no significant difference was reported for the number of days with restrictions from disease.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category A: Consultation processes</HEADING>
<P>Five of the six studies in this intervention category measured consultation process outcomes, and all of these (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>) reported at least one consultation process outcome in favour of the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>, the consultation length for providers who were trained to be patient-centred was shorter than for those who were given prompt sheets without training. Similarly, providers in the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2004</LINK> completed more PCC activities and performed better in three of six condition-specific process measures. In <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>, patients in the intervention group were more likely to report maximum communication with GPs; but there was no significant difference between the two groups for agreement between patient and provider on main concerns discussed over the year. Similarly, intervention providers had better results in two out of three consultation process outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Krones-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Krones 2008</LINK>; and in one of two in <LINK REF="STD-Loh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Loh 2007</LINK>.</P>

For example, <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK> assessed from audiotapes of patient question asking, information needs, and information recall and found that among patients with prompt sheets, patients of trained doctors recalled significantly more information about treatment issues and side effects. Similarly, patients with prompt sheets whose doctors were trained recalled significantly more information in total than those whose doctors were not trained (P = 0.036). There was no difference in frequency of response for the seven items comprising the information needs scale. Patients of untrained providers were significantly more anxious than patients of trained providers.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome category D: Health status</HEADING>
<P>All six studies in this intervention category assessed at least one outcome on health status and well being; the intervention resulted in at least one positive outcome in three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK> used the Spielberg questionnaire to assess anxiety at baseline, immediately after consultations and after 10 days. Patients with prompt sheets alone were significantly more anxious than patients with trained doctors. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2006</LINK> found better glycated haemoglobin and blood pressure levels in the intervention group, although they found no difference in systolic blood pressure, cholesterol or creatinine levels. In <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK> three of eight outcomes relating to health status and well being showed statistically significant differences, but only one outcome was in favour of intervention. One year after the intervention, overall well being scores were significantly higher in the intervention group. However, average blood triglyceride concentrations and average body mass index were both also higher (i.e. worse) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Furthermore, one year after the intervention, there were no significant differences between the intervention and the control group for mean glycated haemoglobin concentrations; mean total cholesterol; and for mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There also were no significant differences between the groups for mean scores on diabetes-specific quality of life and depressed well being questionnaires, or on various sub-scales of a generic well being questionnaire (depression, anxiety, and energy subscales).
