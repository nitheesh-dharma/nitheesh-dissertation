<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide. There has been a significant increase in prevalence among children over the last two decades and this increase has been accompanied by a parallel increase in comorbid illnesses such as asthma. Symptoms include sneezing, itching, runny nose and nasal congestion. Allergic rhinitis may be defined as 'persistent' or 'intermittent'. These classifications loosely correspond to perennial (all year round) allergic rhinitis and seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever'). There are a wide range of drug treatments available including topical and oral decongestants, topical and oral antihistamines, topical and systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists and a number of over the counter preparations. Topical steroids (nasal sprays) are often prescribed, and act directly on the nasal mucosa to reduce symptoms. </P>
<P>The authors of the review identified a large number of randomised controlled trials, however many were excluded due to the use of 'rescue' (additional) medication, which may have confounded the results. </P>
<P>The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of Beconase® and flunisolide used topically in the nose for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. The review authors concluded that until more research is available, decisions on the use of topical steroids should be guided by the physician's clinical experience and patients' individual circumstances and preferences.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide. There has been a significant increase in prevalence among children over the last two decades and this increase has been accompanied by a parallel increase in comorbid illnesses such as asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and adverse event profiles of topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and EMBASE (1974 onwards) on 5<SUP>th</SUP> September 2005. CINAHL, <I>m</I>RCT(a meta-database of controlled trials), NRR (the National Research Register), LILACS, MedCarib, KOREAMED, IndMed, Samed, Panteleimon, Zetoc, ISI Proceedings, the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trials Database and the websites of AstraZeneca, Schering Plough and Aventis were also searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing topical nasal steroid preparations against each other or placebo, prescribed for allergic rhinitis in children. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included trials. The limited and variable quality of reported data precluded any pooling of results and only a descriptive summary is presented. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials involving a total of 79 participants were included. All three trials, which compared topical nasal steroids against placebo for perennial rhinitis, provided some, albeit limited data, relevant to our primary outcomes; but in two of the trials the data analysis was flawed and in the third trial it was incomprehensible. None of the trials provided data relevant to our secondary outcomes. There were no adverse events reported from any of the interventions. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of Beconase® and flunisolide used topically intranasally for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. The reduction of severity in symptoms as assessed by the trialists could not be confirmed with the data provided and decisions on the use of these medications should, until such time as more robust evidence is available, be guided by the physician's clinical experience and patients' individual circumstances and preferences.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Fireman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fireman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2002</LINK>). There has been a significant increase in prevalence among children over the last two decades and this increase has been accompanied by a parallel increase in comorbid illnesses such as asthma. Studies have consistently shown that the UK has one of the highest levels of allergic rhinitis in the world but the true prevalence may be difficult to assess as symptoms vary and patients with mild symptoms may self-medicate with over the counter medicines. Incidence and severity are related to age, with children of school age most commonly affected. The mean age of onset is 10 years and the incidence peaks between the ages of 13 and 19 years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis is clinically defined as a symptomatic disorder of the nasal membranes and surrounding tissues induced by an IgE mediated inflammation after the exposure of the nasal membranes to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2001</LINK>). It is a mucosal allergic reaction which occurs in genetically predisposed individuals in whom cells, which were previously sensitised by an antigen, are triggered to release chemical mediators (<LINK REF="REF-Ledford-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledford 1998</LINK>). The immediate response to an antigen is known as the early-phase allergic reaction, in which histamine and other inflammatory mediators are released from mast cells in the nasal mucosa. The released histamine acts on nerve endings to cause the characteristic nasal symptoms which include sneezing, pruritus (itching), rhinorrhoea (runny nose) and nasal congestion. A late-phase allergic reaction occurs approximately 4 to 12 hours after antigen exposure with nasal congestion as the predominant symptom. Children may exhibit other signs such as allergic salute (the rubbing of the hand against the nose in response to pruritus and rhinorrhoea), allergic shiner (bruised appearance on the skin under one or both eyes) and allergic crease (a wrinkle across the bridge of the nose caused by repeated allergic salute).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Although allergic rhinitis is not life threatening it is often associated with a significant reduction in quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2001</LINK>). By limiting daily activity, allergic rhinitis may have a negative impact on social behaviour and the emotional well-being of children, and may be responsible for absenteeism and inefficient performance at school (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Classification</HEADING>
<P>Allergic rhinitis has been defined as seasonal or perennial based on the duration of exposure to the allergen. The more recent ARIA guidelines of the World Health Organisation include a classification which utilises symptoms and quality of life parameters (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2001</LINK>). It is based on the duration of symptoms, which are either 'intermittent' or 'persistent', and is further subdivided into either 'mild' or 'moderate to severe', depending on the degree of severity and the impact on quality of life. The classification is defined as intermittent if the symptoms last for less than four days per week or for less than four weeks per year, whereas symptoms which last in excess of four days per week and for more than four weeks per year are classified as persistent. The severity of the symptoms can be classified as mild if daily activities such as sport and leisure are normal and there is no disruption to work, school or sleep patterns. Moderate to severe symptoms would be indicated by an impact on one or more of the following; sleep, daily activities such as sport and leisure, and work or school.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on a typical history of allergic symptoms. However, as some of these symptoms may not necessarily be of allergic origin the diagnosis may additionally be confirmed through a combination of in vivo and in vitro diagnostic tests. These may include both serological testing for IgE in conjunction with skin-prick testing (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1997</LINK>). The evaluation of skin tests can be as valuable as the assessment of allergen-specific IgE in serum but caution should be exercised when interpreting results as a positive result may not mean that the allergen is the specific cause of the illness. Serological testing is directed towards the detection of free or cell-bound IgE using enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST) or a radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The immediate hypersensitivity skin tests made with the suspected allergens or other aeroallergens can be used to demonstrate an IgE-mediated allergic reaction.</P>
<P>Nasal challenge tests with allergens have been used extensively in research but may also prove useful in the diagnosis of occupation related allergic rhinitis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Persistent rhinitis is most commonly due to an allergy to the house dust mite. Allergen avoidance is the first line of treatment and there are a variety of measures used to reduce dust mite exposure. Some of the 'environmental' methods include physical changes (heating, ventilation, freezing, washing, barrier methods, air filtration, vacuuming, and ionisers) or chemical treatments (acaricides). There is, however, considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions in treating allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Sheikh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheikh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gelfand-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfand 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological treatments include a wide range of topical and oral decongestants, topical and oral antihistamines, anticholinergic agents, topical sodium cromoglycate, topical and systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists and a number of over the counter preparations. However, environmental control (allergen avoidance) measures are often recommended before or in association with pharmacological treatment.</P>
<P>The first line pharmacological approach will largely depend on the frequency, severity and duration of symptoms. For example, in the early phase of the allergic reaction, when histamine and inflammatory mediators are released, antihistamines may be considered the most appropriate treatment. In the late phase corticosteroids appear to be more effective in dealing with the inflammatory response, however some of their side effects are well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ARIA guidelines for treatment of allergic rhinitis base their recommendations for the appropriate treatment on randomised controlled trials carried out on studies performed using the historical classification of rhinitis. The clinical recommendations associated with these guidelines have now been adapted to the new classification (<LINK REF="REF-ARIA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARIA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Cauwenberge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cauwenberge 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical nasal steroids</HEADING>
<P>Topical nasal corticosteroids are frequently prescribed by paediatricians, rhinologists and allergists for the treatment of children with allergic rhinitis. They act directly on the nasal mucosa where they can produce their optimal effect (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>). Dexamethasone, betamethasone, beclomethasone dipropionate, flunisolide, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, triamcinolone and mometasone furoate are the most commonly available.</P>
<P>Topical steroids are capable of almost complete inhibition of late-phase nasal symptoms, although they have a limited effect on the early phase of the allergic response in sensitised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rak 1994</LINK>). There is also evidence that in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis the regular use of nasal steroid sprays can reduce rhinorrhoea and overall long-term symptom scores (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2003</LINK>). The developmental vulnerability of children, however, means that the risk/benefits of topical steroids need to be assessed on an individual basis (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfand-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfand 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Disadvantages associated with topical corticosteroids are local irritation of the mucosa, nasal burning and sneezing after administration. Bloody nasal discharge and septal perforations have been reported in a few cases (<LINK REF="REF-LaForce-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaForce 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naclerio-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naclerio 1993</LINK>). Although rare, delayed hypersensitivity reactions can occur (<LINK REF="REF-Bircher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bircher 1996</LINK>) and systemic effects are generally uncommon but some studies have shown that dexamethasone, beclomethasone and betamethasone may induce moderate adrenal suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Michels-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michels 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gazis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gazis 1999</LINK>) and growth retardation in children (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2000</LINK>). In addition some of the side effects may be indistinguishable from the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Economic costs</HEADING>
<P>The possible association between allergic rhinitis and other comorbidities needs to be considered when evaluating the socio-economic impact of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1997</LINK>). The direct economic cost can be fairly high and this is of particular importance in under-resourced countries (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nash-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nash 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santos 1999</LINK>). The direct cost of physician visits and medication expenses is at least $1.8 billion annually, or nearly 2.5 percent of the $47 billion annual direct cost for respiratory treatment in the United States. Moreover, the estimated cost of lost productivity to employers and society as a result of allergic rhinitis approaches nearly $3.8 billion annually. In the mid-1990s, according to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the resulting total annual cost for allergic rhinitis amounted to $5.6 billion (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review has shown some benefit of using intranasal corticosteroids over either sedating or non-sedating antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Yanez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanez 2002</LINK>). Another recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2002</LINK>) assessed the efficacy of treatments for non-allergic and allergic rhinitis which included antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, immunotherapy, sedating and non-sedating antihistamines, cromolyn sodium, anticholinergic agents, leukotriene inhibitors and sympathomimetics. The review included male and female children and adults, minorities, people on low incomes and elderly patients. It did not provide explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria for the outcomes assessed and searched only one English language database. Significantly, most of the clinical trials were supported by pharmaceutical companies and the majority of included studies reported no major adverse events.</P>
<P>A number of clinical trials have studied topical corticosteroids for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in children. A systematic review is now required to evaluate the evidence for safety and effectiveness</P>

<P>The search strategy identified 3259 references which, after initial evaluation for relevancy and discarding of all duplicate references, yielded 1061 studies for further consideration. The abstracts of these were then further assessed independently by two of the authors (JS/ZF) resulting in 79 references to studies for potential inclusion. Full text copies of these studies were obtained and were then subjected to further analysis by both authors.</P>
<P>After consultation and discussion with the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Editorial Group it was agreed that the use of rescue or concomitant medication in any of the included trials might confound outcomes assessment and therefore these trials were to be excluded from this review. Thus a further sixty-one trials, which had permitted the use of rescue medications during the treatment phase, were excluded.</P>
<P>We arranged to translate one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wahn-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Wahn 1978</LINK>), which was in the German language, but it was subsequently excluded as it permitted the use of rescue medications. Studies in which some of the participants were under the age of 18 but the mean age of all the participants was greater than 18 years were also excluded. All of these excluded trials and the reasons for their exclusion can be found in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hill 1978</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1978</LINK> trial was a randomised double blind placebo controlled cross-over trial which had been conducted in the ENT Clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne Australia. The participants were 22 children (11 girls, 11 boys) aged 7 to 17 years with severe perennial rhinitis. The study was conducted just before and during the grass pollen season. All of the participants were chronic mouth breathers, had gross hypertrophy of the nasal mucosa, excessive rhinorrhea and had failed to respond to antihistamines and adrenergic drugs for their rhinitis symptoms. Nineteen of the participants had evidence of marked systemic reaginic allergy to house dust mite and/or rye grass which had been previously assessed by radioallergosorbent test (RAST).</P>
<P>Randomisation was to either Beconase® (beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol spray) 300 mg/day or placebo, and no concomitant medications were permitted during the course of the study. The intervention or placebo were continued for six weeks and were then crossed over. Patients or their parents completed a daily symptom diary which rated the degree of nasal obstruction, sneezing, itching, nasal discharge and eye irritation. These scores were used to calculate a mean daily nasal and eye symptom score for both placebo and active treatment periods. In addition one of the trialists, who was blinded to the symptom scores and medication used, rated the participants nasal physical signs for patency; mucosal swelling, colour, and mucoid and purulent discharge at the start of the trial and the end of each treatment period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neuman 1978</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Neuman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Neuman 1978</LINK> study was a double blind cross-over trial conducted over a six month period, through the summer and autumn of 1975, in a General Hospital in Israel . The participants consisted of 30 patients (14 males and 16 females) with an age range of 9 to 18 years (mean 13.8 years) and a history of perennial rhinitis with daily symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction of at least five years duration. All participants exhibited a positive skin-prick test with standard airborne allergens. None had previously used steroid therapy but all had daily symptoms which were poorly controlled by antihistamines and decongestants. Randomisation was to beclomethasone dipropionate 50 mg inhaled into each nostril four times a day or placebo, details of the cross-over and wash out segments of the trial were not reported. The trialists indicated that the study was conducted over a six-month period yet only provided data for "two three week periods" and were not clear about the follow-up period.</P>
<P>The mode of administration of the treatment or placebo was checked by the trialists at each of the weekly visits. All other medications were withdrawn one week before the start of the trial.</P>
<P>Diary cards, which recorded symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, blocked or itchy nose and throat, cough and headache were completed by the patients. The severity of the symptoms was rated on a 4-point ordinal scale; 0 = no symptoms, 1 = symptoms of less than 30 minutes duration, 2 = symptoms between 30 minutes and two hours, 3 = symptoms lasting longer than two hours. These cards were reviewed weekly when the patients returned for physical examination and the daily scores were used to calculate mean daily and weekly symptom scores as well as a final score at the end of each test period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sarsfield 1979</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Sarsfield-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sarsfield 1979</LINK> study was a double blind cross-over study conducted in the UK. Twenty-seven children (21 boys and six girls), age range from 7 to 16 years (mean 12.3) and with a mean duration of perennial allergic rhinitis of 7.4 years, were enrolled in the study, but there was one withdrawal during the placebo period because of nasal irritation. All participants exhibited a positive skin-prick test to the most common allergens and none of them were taking any oral corticosteroids or using any local nasal treatment at the start of the trial. Randomisation was to either, nasal spray consisting of flunisolide as an aqueous propylene glycol solution (0.025% w/v) supplied in a glass bottle fitted with a mechanical pump which was capable of delivering 0.1 ml per actuation, or placebo (vehicle only) in an identical glass bottle.</P>
<P>One group received active nasal spray for four weeks followed by placebo for four weeks and the other group received the same treatment but in reverse order. Participants were instructed to use one spray up each nostril three times daily at eight hourly intervals which provided a total daily dose of 150 mg. Diary cards were filled in at the end of each week by either participants or their parents. These recorded the severity of sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose and nose blowing which were rated on a four-point scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Clinical assessments were made on admission to the study and at the end of each treatment period. The severity of allergic symptoms (sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, nose blowing, post nasal drip, epistaxis and throat itch) during the previous month was recorded by direct questioning and scored according to the four-point scale. Any adverse effects from either intervention or placebo were noted and an overall assessment of the control of symptoms was made at the end of each four-week trial period and was rated as total, good, minor, none or worse. At the end of the eight-week treatment period the trial concluded with an assessment of the preferences of the participants to one or neither of the treatments. Seven of the children who had achieved some benefit with flunisolide were encouraged to continue using the spray for a further six months and were followed up with bi-monthly open assessment of their symptoms which included the reporting of any side effects to the medication.</P>

<P>The Hill study was a small sample trial in which the participants were randomised to the intervention (Beconase®) and control (placebo) groups but the method of randomisation was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1978</LINK>). However the trialists indicated that the randomisation code was only broken and revealed to the assessors at the conclusion of the trial. The trialists did not provide any details on how blinding of the medication and placebo was achieved. Randomisation was graded as unclear (B) whilst allocation concealment was graded as adequate (A). There were no losses to follow up and therefore this criterion was graded as yes (A).</P>
<P>The Neuman study reported that the participants were allocated at random in a double blind fashion to intervention and control, but the method used to randomise participants was not mentioned by the trialists and therefore this criterion was graded as (B) unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Neuman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Neuman 1978</LINK>). No details were provided on how blinding of medications was achieved or how the allocation sequence was concealed from participants and trialists and thus this criterion was graded (B) unclear. Two early drop outs were replaced and all participants completed the trial and therefore this criterion was graded as (A) clear.</P>
<P>The Sarsfield study provided no details of the method used to randomise the participants or how the allocation sequence was concealed from trialists or participants and thus both criteria were graded as unclear (B) (<LINK REF="STD-Sarsfield-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sarsfield 1979</LINK>). Blinding of intervention and placebo was achieved through the use of identical glass bottles containing either placebo or medication and was graded 'yes'. Only one child, in the placebo group, withdrew and was excluded from the analysis. There were no losses to follow up and therefore this criterion was graded as (A) clear.</P>

<P>In view of the scarcity and poor quality of their data none of the three included trials were able to provide any reliable evidence regarding the effectiveness of either Beconase® or flunisolide used topically intranasally for the treatment of intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. Therefore we present a descriptive summary of some of the results and include a commentary on the analysis and interpretation of the outcomes data reported in these trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes as reported in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Neuman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Neuman 1978</LINK>) consisted of a free-hand drawn graph of the mean daily nasal symptom scores. It was not possible to decipher any precise values from this graph and thus no inferences could be drawn from it nor from the rather limited data in the accompanying text. The trialists reported that the diary cards indicated that runny and stuffed noses as opposed to cough and sneezing showed the most marked improvements, but it was not possible to confirm these outcomes from the data that were provided. The daily nasal symptom scores, which had been collected from an ordinal rating scale, were transformed into mean daily nasal symptom scores. However, the transformation of this ordinal data into means and mean change scores, and its further analysis and interpretation would appear to be more appropriate to observations measured on a continuous rating scale. Furthermore, the narrow range of possible answers on this type of short symptom scale is likely to make interpretation of an "average score" difficult and thus the data reported in this trial were not particularly useful.</P>
<P>Data showing lowered mean daily nasal symptom scores (P &lt; 0.01) within five days of starting treatment were reported in the Hill trial. The trialists indicated that nasal signs were improved in 15 of the children and that in 13 of the children mean daily eye symptoms scores were decreased during the active treatment phase of the study (P &lt; 0.05). At the completion of this study (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1978</LINK>), only three children out of the total appeared to show no improvement in their daily diary symptom scores and 14 of them expressed a preference for Beconase® over placebo. However, it was not clear from the study details whether a continuous or ordinal rating scale was used to assess the eye and nasal symptoms and thus we were uncertain whether the transformation of the daily symptom scores into means was plausible and therefore advise caution in the interpretation of this data.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Sarsfield-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sarsfield 1979</LINK> study provided three sets of data relevant to our primary outcomes; mean weekly self assessed symptom scores, physician's assessment of changes in symptom scores from baseline (admission) values to the end point and, patient's subjective assessments of overall control after each four-week treatment period. The data reported in the first table were the means of daily scores recorded in the diary cards, the second table listed the mean and (SD) of changes in symptom scores from baseline (admission) to the end of the treatment period. All of the daily symptom scores, which had been obtained from a short ranked ordinal scale, were transformed into mean and standard deviation of weekly symptom scores. As in the Neuman trial, the investigators in this trial assessed symptoms on an ordinal rating scale and presented outcomes data as means and standard deviations (SD), however the differences between these measured values cannot be considered interpretable in a quantitative sense and therefore the conclusions reached may be suspect. Moreover, to ensure that this trial provided information on the effects of the intervention, a comparison should have been made using the Wilcoxon paired sign-rank test of the differences in score for treatment versus control and not solely the difference in the treatment group (or the control group) from baseline to end point as was done in the analysis. In the absence of any reliable data reflecting treatment outcomes for the active intervention in this trial we have not included any of its data in our review.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>No adverse events from Beconase® or flunisolide were reported and there was no evidence of candidiasis during the study period or in the long term follow up, in either the Neuman or Hill trials. Although the Sarsfield study did not provide any evidence of adrenal suppression with flunisolide, it was considered that this was most probably due to the low dose used and the rapid metabolism of the drug in the liver.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The comprehensive search used in this review provided a large number of references to trials, however the number of relevant randomised controlled trials that were retrieved proved to be somewhat disappointing. It is clearly apparent that the selection of trials to ensure a pure comparison between intervention and placebo by excluding trials which permitted access to rescue medicines may have resulted in a lower number of included trials than expected, and all of which were over 25 years old. However, this absence of more recent clinical trials may reflect contemporary changes, current trends and more stringent requirements in the ethical conduct of clinical trials. </P>
<P>The lack of any robust evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of either Beconase® or flunisolide in reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis was largely attributable to poor methodological quality and the scarcity and flawed analysis of the data in all three of the included trials. Advancements in theoretical formulation of test statistics now allow for a more plausible analysis and interpretation of outcomes which are based on ordinal data. However, the lack of a wash-out period and absence of important trial details such as the type of measurement scale used in one of the trials has compromised the internal and external validity of the included trials and further diminished any confidence in the applicability and generalisability of their results to any potential clinical applications. </P>
<P>Even though no adverse events were reported, the apparent lack of effectiveness and seemingly low side effect profile of these medications should not be seen as a recommendation for the use of stronger dosage regimens.</P>
<P>It is known that the steroid group of drugs are capable of almost complete inhibition of late-phase nasal symptoms in allergic rhinitis, and it was regrettable that our searches proved unsuccessful in finding any trials which differentiated between the early or late stage of allergic response and thus we were unable to test our null hypothesis; that there is no difference in the relief of symptoms for patients who have taken nasal topical steroids for early as compared to late-phase allergic rhinitis. </P>
<P>As the included trials were conducted before the advent of the more recent classifications of allergic rhinitis, based on 'intermittent' or 'persistent' symptoms, we were also unable to assess the impact of these interventions on patient relevant outcomes such as quality of life, social behaviour and emotional well being.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The three included trials provided some weak and unreliable evidence for the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children. The reduction of severity in symptoms as assessed by the trialists could not be confirmed with the data provided and decisions on the use of these types of medications should, until such time as more robust evidence is available, be guided by a physician's clinical experience and patients' individual circumstances and preferences. </P>
<P>Although the three studies were conducted in the developed world the relevance and cost implications of the results of this review for resource poor developing countries, where low dose intranasal corticosteroids are prescribed as the first line treatment for mild or persistent allergic rhinitis, cannot be underestimated. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research should ensure that all new trials are well designed randomised controlled trials and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (http://www.consort-statement.org). These should also include a larger sample, a longer intervention and follow-up period, and if a cross-over design is used, ensure that there is a sufficiently long enough wash out period between intervention and placebo. Outcomes data, particularly if generated from an ordinal rating scale, should be analysed appropriately and interpreted in such way that meaningful conclusions can be reached. </P>
<P>The re-classification of allergic rhinitis into persistent and intermittent categories, based on the duration and severity of symptoms, aligns the assessment of outcomes more closely with those outcomes of relevance to patients and therefore future trials should focus more on these patient assessed outcomes and quality of life measures.</P>
<P>Changing requirements for the ethical conduct of clinical trials are likely to lead to a more permissive use of rescue medications, therefore future trials should more closely monitor and report on rescue medication use and trialists should investigate and test for potential confounding by examining differences between groups through the use of modelling techniques i.e. ANOVA, or multi-variate regression analysis.</P>
