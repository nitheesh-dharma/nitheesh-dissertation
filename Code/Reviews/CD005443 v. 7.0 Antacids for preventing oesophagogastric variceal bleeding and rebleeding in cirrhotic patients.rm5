<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-16 19:11:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Ruptured gastroesophageal varices are the most severe and frequent cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients, leading to death in 5% to 8% of patients during the first 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2004</LINK>), and oesophagogastric varices account for 60% to 80% of first bleeding in patients with portal hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Triger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dagher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2002</LINK>). The incidence of rebleeding ranges between 50% and 80%, and mortality ranges from 30% to 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Zeng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 1998</LINK>). Early rebleeding is significantly related to death within six weeks.</P>
<P>Because of their effectiveness and safety, antacid drugs are used in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, caused by peptic ulcer or acid-related diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2002</LINK>). Antacids are often used for emergency treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis of the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2002</LINK>). Many controlled trials have been carried out on treatment with antacids, which may stop bleeding and prevent rebleeding (<LINK REF="REF-MacDougall-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDougall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuckerman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Zuckerman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snady-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Snady 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2002</LINK>). In cirrhotic patients, the gastric acid secretion may be reduced, but the coexisting reduction of the gastric mucosal defence mechanism and back effusion of H+ may contribute to gastric erosion and bleeding in patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2002</LINK>). However, there are different opinions about this question, based on the fact that patients with liver cirrhosis generally have lower gastric acid secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Pique-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pique 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smart-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smart 1991</LINK>). We could not find any systematic reviews or meta-analyses investigating the beneficial and harmful effects of antacids for preventing oesophagogastric bleeding and rebleeding.</P>

<P>We followed the instructions given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Trial selection </B>
<BR/>All identified studies were reviewed independently by two reviewers (WZ and GZ) in order to determine eligibility. Disagreement were solved by consensus with provision of arbitration of a third reviewer (WY) whenever required. Trials published in abstract form were to be included if full details of the trial and results could be obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality components</B>
<BR/>We defined the methodological quality as the confidence that the design and report restrict bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). We planned to assess the methodological quality by four separate components (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) because of the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with inadequate methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). If at a future update randomised trials were to be found, we would analyse the influence of methodological quality by the four separate components:</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice will be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. These studies are known as quasi-randomised and will be excluded from the present review when assessing beneficial effects.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding (or masking)<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding involved identical placebo or active drugs.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not double blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Furthermore, we will register whether or not the randomised clinical trials have used an 'intention-to-treat' analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>) and a sample size calculation.</P>
<P>Study quality will be assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second one. Eventual differences in the quality assessment of trials will be resolved in discussion in order to reach consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection</B>
<BR/>The authors used a standard form to independently extract data. Two authors were about to extract information on the following: number of randomised participants, types of participants and types of interventions, method of allocation concealment, loss to follow-up, the use of blinding and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out. The outcome data sought are numbers of deaths in each group, numbers of bleeding and rebleeding, and the adverse events. Data were extracted by each author working independently. Recorded data were cross checked by the authors. The following variables were extracted: survival, bleeding, and rebleeding rates.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analyses</B>
<BR/>Due to the lack of randomised trials, we could not perform data analyses. If trials are identified and included in the future, we will adhere to the following protocol. We will use the software package RevMan Analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. The analyses will include all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up, according to the 'intention-to-treat' principle, and using the last reported observed response ('carry forward'). We will perform both a 'worst-best-case scenario' analysis, which considers all dropout patients in the antacids or the acid-suppressive medications group as dead and the dropout patients in the control group as alive, and a 'best-worst-case scenario' analysis, which considers all dropout patients in the antacids or acid-suppressive medications group as alive and the dropout patients in the control group as dead.</P>
<P>The extracted data from the various trials will be combined by calculating a pooled estimate of the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data. For continuous data the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI will be measured. We plan to perform the meta-analysis by both random-effects and fixed-effect model. We will only report the results of fixed effect model if there is no difference between the two methods regarding the significance of intervention effect, otherwise we will report the results produced by both models. We will explore evidence of publication bias and other biases by funnel plot analyses. Funnel plot on the primary outcome will be used to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates are associated with study size. We will use two tests to assess funnel plot asymmetry, adjusted rank correlation test and regression asymmetry test.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup/Sensitivity analyses </B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials - we will compare the trials with adequate methodological quality to the trials with unclear/inadequate methodological quality.</LI>
<LI>We will compare the trials with co-interventions to the trials without co-interventions.</LI>
<LI>Etiology of cirrhosis - we will compare the effects of antacids in different etiologies of liver cirrhosis.</LI>
<LI>Child-Pugh grade (<LINK REF="REF-Pugh-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugh 1973</LINK>) - we will compare the effects of antacids in different Child-Pugh grades (A, B, and C).</LI>
<LI>Size of oesophagogastric varices - we will compare the effects of antacids patients with different size of oesophagogastric varices (small, medium, large) at entry into the trials.</LI>
<LI>Kinds of antacids - we will compare the effects of different kinds of antacids.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Due to the large number of comparisons planned we will interpret any significant findings conservatively. The main analysis will focus on the primary outcome measures in trials with adequate methodology.</P>

<P>In recent times, the 6-week mortality rate of cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding has fallen to 20% due to the development of effective treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2004</LINK>). Peptic ulceration and reflux oesophagitis are some of the reasons for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Amitrano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amitrano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2003</LINK>). Antacids may be helpful for preventing oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients theoretically, but we have been unable to identify evidence supporting the use of antacids for preventing oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients. Randomised clinical trials should explore this hypothesis. This would require trials with large sample sizes because the deaths from uncontrolled bleeding or rebleeding are approximately 8% in consecutive patients with cirrhosis and upper digestive bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is widely known that clinicians make practical decisions, often on the basis of inadequate information. Decisions about treatment should preferably be taken based on the results of randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The basis for the rational use of antacids in liver patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains unknown. What could the reason of this uncertainty be? First, randomised clinical trials to answer the research question of our review have not yet been carried out. Second, it is possible that some trials have been carried out, but came with negative results, and thus remained unpublished (<LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1998</LINK>). This causes publication bias, reducing the possibilities to develop valid systematic reviews in certain areas. The paucity of data on antacids for liver patients with the risk of oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and bleeding should stimulate the development of well-planned randomised trials to inform clinical practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-12 18:17:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>No randomised clinical trials of antacids for preventing oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients were found for inclusion in this review. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether antacids are beneficial or harmful for preventing oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients. We cannot recommend antacids for use outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-16 19:30:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, adequately powered randomised clinical trials to assess the benefits and harms of antacids as a possible way to improve the survival and decrease mortality from oesophagogastric variceal bleeding and rebleeding in cirrhotic patients. The trials regarding this issue should be reported according to the CONSORT Statement for improving the quality of reporting of benefits and harms in clinical research (www.consort-statement.org) (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2004</LINK>).</P>
