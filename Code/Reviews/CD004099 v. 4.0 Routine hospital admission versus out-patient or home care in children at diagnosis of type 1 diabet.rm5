<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Traditionally, children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes have been admitted to hospital to make sure that blood sugar and symptoms of the disease are well controlled and to teach the child and his/her family how to manage the diabetes. In some cases, the child is acutely ill and needs hospital admission to receive intravenous fluids, but in many cases the child is not acutely ill. Being in hospital is often stressful for children and their families and home-based care may provide a more natural environment for the children and families to learn how to deal with the diabetes. This review asked the question whether there are any benefits or dangers of using this type of care. We found only data of limited quality and or applicability, so no clear answers are possible. The seven studies we looked at suggested that home management of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes does not lead to any disadvantages in terms of blood glucose, acute diabetic complications and hospitalisations, psychological variables and behaviour, or total costs. This would be particularly relevant for children not acutely ill, but also for children who require a short period of initial treatment in the hospital. <BR/> </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In many places, children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus are admitted to hospital for metabolic stabilisation and training, even if they are not acutely ill. Out-patient or home based management of these children could avoid the stress associated with a hospital stay, could provide a more natural learning environment for the child and its family, and might reduce costs for both the health care system and the families.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of routine hospital admission compared to out-patient or home-based management in children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index. Additionally, we searched reference lists of relevant studies identified and contacted one of the trialists about further studies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Comparative studies of initial hospitalisation compared to home-based and/or out-patient management in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were independently selected by two reviewers. Data extraction and quality assessment of trials were done independently by two reviewers. Authors of included studies were contacted for missing information. Results were summarised descriptively, using tables and text. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies were included in the review, including a total of 298 children in the out-patient/home group. The one high quality trial identified suggested that home-based management of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes may lead to slightly improved long term metabolic control (at two and three years follow-up). No differences between comparison groups were found in any of the psychosocial and behavioural variables assessed or in rates of acute diabetic complications within two years. Parental costs were found to be decreased, while health system costs were increased, leaving total social costs virtually unchanged. None of the other studies assessing metabolic control found a difference between the comparison groups. There seemed to be no differences in hospitalisations or acute diabetic complications between the out-patient/home groups and the hospital groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Due to the generally low quality or limited applicability of the studies identified, the results of this review are inconclusive. On the whole, the data seem to suggest that where adequate out-patient/home management of type 1 diabetes in children at diagnosis can be provided, this does not lead to any disadvantages in terms of metabolic control, acute diabetic complications and hospitalisations, psychosocial variables and behaviour, or total costs.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:31:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. The most common types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes, where type 1 diabetes involves an absolute insulin dependence and generally starts in childhood. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)').

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hospital admission at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes</HEADING>
<P>At diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, some children are acutely ill and need to be admitted to hospital. Symptoms at presentation of type 1 diabetes are generally subdivided into mild, moderate and severe. Mild symptoms include polydipsia (abnormal thirst, leading to drinking of large amounts of fluid), polyuria (copious urine), loss of weight, exhaustion and problems with concentration. In the moderate form, dehydration is present in addition to the named symptoms, and the severe form includes mild to moderate ketoacidosis with severe dehydration (ketoacidosis is an elevated production of ketone bodies in type 1 diabetes due to a deranged fat metabolism, leading to increased acidity of the blood). The moderate and severe forms require infusion therapy to achieve rehydration, replacement of electrolytes, insulin substitution and calory supply, and thereby necessitate hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00fc_rter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hürter 2000</LINK>). Reported proportions of the different manifestations at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes vary greatly, partially depending on the delay between the onset of the disease and the time when a doctor is seen. In Western European countries and the USA, about a third to half of newly diagnosed children present with the mild symptoms and up to about a third present with ketoacidosis (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hamman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00fc_rter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hürter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadauskaite-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadauskaite 2002</LINK>). In some Arabian countries however, diabetic ketoacidosis is present in 67% to 80% of patients presenting with type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Kulaylat-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulaylat 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Punnose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Punnose 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>This means that up to half of the patients are not acutely ill and can be managed on an out-patient basis. There are conflicting beliefs concerning hospital admission in children who are not acutely ill at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Some clinicians think that admission provides an opportunity for intensive education which will provide benefits regarding long term outcomes. Others think that admission encourages dependence on hospital support and that patient empowerment - and thereby competence regarding self-management - will be greater if the children are not admitted to hospital. It is known that there is considerable variation in the number of admissions to hospital in the years following diagnosis, from none at all to over 50 in a 10-year period (Scottish Study Group for the Care of Diabetes in the Young, unpublished data). It is possible that the type of care at diagnosis influences subsequent admission rates.</P>
<P>The main tasks after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children are to achieve metabolic stabilisation and minimise diabetes-related acute complications (for example, ketoacidosis, hypoglycaemia), to reassure patients and family and to educate them with respect to diabetes management. Considerations regarding hospitalisation at diagnosis (for children who are not dehydrated or ketotic) therefore fall into three (interlinked) domains: 1. Which form of care is better for achieving metabolic stabilisation without acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycaemia? 2. Which form of care provides the best psychological support for children with diabetes and their families and the best environment for learning diabetes self-management, while maintaining patient empowerment? and 3. Which form of care provides better long term control of diabetes?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Practice</HEADING>
<P>Practices regarding hospitalisation of children at diagnosis of diabetes vary both within countries and internationally. Some centres, for example in the UK and in the USA, use largely out-patient care alone when children are not acutely ill at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Agwu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agwu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kostraba-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kostraba 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvilly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McEvilly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1986</LINK>), whereas in other countries (for example, some east European countries and Finland) average durations of hospital stay after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes have been a month or more (in the early 1990s)(<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Modes of care for children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes</HEADING>
<P>Whether inpatient or out-patient and home management of diabetes at diagnosis are more beneficial will not only depend on the site of management but also on the systems and expertise that can be called upon in the different settings. For example, home care ideally requires multidisciplinary teams, or at least a specialised nurse, that can spend time with families at home and provide 24-hour coverage (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1993</LINK>). In situations where systems for adequate home support are not available, reducing hospitalisation of children may be counterproductive. Additionally, various scenarios are possible, ranging from a child spending several days or weeks in hospital, ideally in the company of a parent, to children not being admitted but visiting the ward daily (or regularly), or the care taking place mostly at home, with specialised healthcare personnel visiting the families. If a parent is admitted into the hospital with the child, their involvement may also take various forms, ranging from a pure parenting role to the accomplishment of some clinical tasks or to active participation in all aspects of the child's care as a full member of the treatment care team. Similarly, the mode of hospital care will be different regionally and will have changed over time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychosocial factors</HEADING>
<P>From a psychosocial point of view, various arguments have been brought up for and against initial hospital care of children who are not acutely ill after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lowes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenbloom-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbloom 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swift-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the child's point of view, staying in hospital may be traumatising and threatening, whereas staying at home in familiar surroundings may help the child adjust to a new and threatening situation more easily. The child may be able to get into a routine more easily and not be stigmatised by a feeling of 'being ill'.</P>
<P>From the family's point of view, hospitalisation of a child after diagnosis may have both advantages and disadvantages. The realisation that a long term and potentially life threatening chronic disease has begun will be a shock for most and it has been suggested that this shock period may last for one to two weeks and make parents less receptive to any education during that time and that the hospitalisation of the child may take a lot of the burden off the family and reduce the anxiety of having to care for a newly diagnosed child without sufficient expertise. Additionally, even though parents often assume that the home environment is more conducive to learning about the diabetes and its management, in practice there are often many disruptions in a busy household and the hospital environment may provide a better environment for concentrated learning at the onset of the disease. Home management may convey the wrong message about the severity of the condition which could affect glycaemic control adversely.</P>
<P>On the other hand, out-patient and/or home care with practical parent involvement from the beginning may help parents adjust more easily. Depending on the degree of involvement of parents in the in-hospital care, admittance of a parent often leads to negative feelings on the part of the parents, including boredom, the feeling of being on trial and being constantly watched and monitored, and not being able to care enough for siblings who may also be having a stressful time. Also, if parents are not involved in the child's care from the beginning, there is a danger that the child will regard the hospital staff as the experts and not trust the parents enough in their care. Out-patient visits of nurses or other clinical staff to the child's home will take into account the real life situation including normal day-to-day diet and activity, as well as the family situation and responses of different family members.</P>
<P>Finally, whether home or hospital care at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is more appropriate may depend on a number of individual factors, such as the child's age, the socioeconomic and educational status of the family, and the level of anxiety of the parents (children's anxiety is linked to parent anxiety and as home care is more parent-dependent, the child will be more sensitive to the parents' emotional reactions).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>Overall costs of treatment have been suggested to be similar when comparing inpatient to home care (although this is composed of higher short term health system costs offset by lower parental costs) (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>) or lower for home care (<LINK REF="REF-Charron-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charron 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:45:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>One non-systematic review has summarised some evidence on out-patient versus inpatient care of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Charron-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charron 1997</LINK>). However, the methodology of the review is not described and it includes mainly data from non-comparative studies. In addition, it does not include information on one randomised controlled trial investigating inpatient versus home care that has been published since (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>). One Health Technology Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>) investigated the effectiveness of paediatric home care in general, including home care for children with type 1 diabetes (although not necessarily at diagnosis and not necessarily exclusive home care versus hospital care). Based on one randomised controlled trial and three other types of comparative studies (two of which did not fulfil the inclusion criteria of the present review), they found no conclusive results regarding the effectiveness of paediatric home care on clinical or "social" outcomes in children with type 1 diabetes or their families. The authors stress the necessity of high quality trials of models of home care for children with diabetes, exploring which children and families would benefit the most.</P>
<P>The present review aims to summarise the evidence in this area systematically, according to specified quality criteria and taking into account all relevant clinical and psychosocial outcomes. The present review focused on children who are not acutely ill only, to take account of the possibility that even short term hospital exposure may lead to reduced empowerment and increased hospital dependence of the patient. The review will be regularly updated to take account of new evidence.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of routinely admitting children who are not acutely ill to hospital at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus on metabolic control and wellbeing and self-efficacy of the patient and his/her family.</P>
<P>Additionally, if either hospital or out-patient/home care of patients is more effective in achieving good glycaemic control, lower levels of acute complications and psychosocial benefits, to identify the factors that contribute to the effect (for example, different levels of in-hospital involvement of parents, home visits of nurses versus out-patient visits etc.).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We looked preferentially for randomised controlled trials, but also considered quasi-randomised or non-randomised controlled clinical trials, cohort studies and case-control studies. We had planned only to include prospective controlled trials in any meta-analysis and to assess the effect of randomisation in a sensitivity analysis, if possible. We had planned to consider studies in which participants have been followed for at least one year (although longer follow-up periods would be desirable). Due to the sparsity of data identified, we subsequently also included studies of shorter duration.</P>

<P>Children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes who are not acutely ill (that is no ketoacidosis or dehydration, eating and drinking, no other acute illnesses, such as infections).</P>
<P>To be consistent with changes in classification and diagnostic criteria of type 1 diabetes mellitus through the years, the diagnosis should have been established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial (for example, <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Ideally, diagnostic criteria should have been described. The use of diagnostic criteria may seem unnecessary because childhood diabetes is usually type 1 and presents in an unequivocal manner. But in some countries, an increasing number of children with childhood diabetes have type 2 diabetes.</P>

<P>To determine the studies to be assessed, two independent observers (CC, NW) reviewed the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment when the information given suggested that the study: 1. included children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 2. compared routine hospital admission with out-patient or home-based care, 3. assessed one or more relevant clinical outcome measure. When there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, the full article was retrieved for clarification. We had planned to measure interrater agreement using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>) and to discuss any differences in opinion with a third party. However, as the number of suitable studies was small and there was no disagreement on inclusion, this was not done.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:38:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The methodological quality of randomised controlled trials was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). In particular, the following factors were studied:</P>
<P>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Blinding of people administering the intervention is impossible in this case and blinding of participants is considered difficult, so blinding was not assessed as a quality criterion.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (see <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>):<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias;<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias;<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We had planned to use this classification as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we had planned to explore the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>The quality of non-randomised trials and case-control studies were assessed using the criteria suggested by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York (<LINK REF="REF-CRD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2000</LINK>):</P>
<P>Cohort studies:<BR/>

<LI>How comparable are the cases and controls with respect to potential confounding factors?</LI>
<LI>Were interventions and other exposures assessed in the same way for cases and controls?</LI>
<LI>How was the response rate defined?</LI>

<BR/>Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers (CC, ST).

<P>We had planned to summarise data statistically if they had been available, sufficiently similar, and of sufficient quality. Only prospective controlled trials were to be included in a meta-analysis, other data were to be summarised in tabular form. We expected both dichotomous and continuous data. Dichotomous data were to be expressed as relative risks (RR). To increase the ease of interpretation of the results for the reader, these were to be converted to the numbers needed to treat (NNT), if possible (for example, similar follow-up periods). Continuous data were to be expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) and an overall WMD was to be calculated. Overall results were to be calculated based on the random effects model. Heterogeneity was to be tested for using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance being set at P &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity were to be assessed by subgroup and sensitivity analysis as described below. A funnel plot was to be used to assess small study bias.</P>

<P>The initial search identified 539 records. Sixty-two of these were dealing with an assessment of home versus hospital care for people with diabetes, and 29 were possibly comparative studies. The others were excluded as they were not directly related to the question under study. Most studies were identified in the MEDLINE search, but 19 records were identified using searching of reference lists. Six studies were included in the final review (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>). Main reasons for exclusion of studies were: studies not being comparative; articles being reviews, comments or editorials; studies not comparing hospitalisation at diagnosis with out-patient or home care; studies investigating mainly adults (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the included studies fulfilled the original inclusion criteria completely. The only randomised controlled trial that seemed to fulfil the inclusion criteria was published as an abstract only and data were very incomplete (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>). Two studies included children who were initially hospitalised in the out-patient group (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>), two studies only had follow-up periods of up to five weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>), and two studies did not provide important data at baseline, such as a measure of glycaemic control or diabetes severity, to allow a comparison between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>).

<P>The 2006 search update identified one other relevant study (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>). Three more potentially relevant studies were excluded as they were narrative reviews and not comparative studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lowes-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lowes 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowes-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Lowes 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvilly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McEvilly 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study types</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies were randomised controlled trials ( <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>), although one was only published as an abstract. Three studies were cohort studies in which an out-patient/home cohort was compared to a cohort either obtained from hospital or diabetes register records (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>) or was compared with patients referred to the centre after diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>). These were retrospective studies in that patients diagnosed in the past were compared at the time of the study based on the intervention they had received at diagnosis. In another study, out-patient and hospital cohorts were compared in a prospective design (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>). In one study, two cohorts were compared before (hospitalisation) and after (outpatient care) introduction of a diabetes day care centre (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Duration of follow-up varied between one month and up to 15 years. Two trials only had short periods of follow-up of up to 5 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>), one trial had a follow-up of one year (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>), two trials had a follow-up of two years (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>), and the remaining studies had follow-up periods of between three and 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four of the studies were conducted in North America (USA (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>) and Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>)), one in Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>), one in Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>), and one in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>). All studies were published in English.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants ranged from 20 to 223, with a total of 298 participants in the out-patient/home group. Age and sex of participants were not mentioned in the study by Simell et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>), and sex was not mentioned in the study by Srinivasan et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>), but all other studies included similar numbers of boys and girls. The mean age of most groups was between ten and thirteen years (between 8 and 9 years in the study by Srinivasan et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies (usually those allowing for a short period of hospitalisation initially) also included more severe cases in the out-patient/home care group (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK> - not mentioned explicitly by the other studies), whereas others excluded more severe cases (ketoacidosis, dehydration) from the study (<LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>). Two of the studies stated explicitly that they included patients in the out-patient/home group who had been hospitalised for a short period of time initially for metabolic stabilisation and/or rehydration and correction of ketoacidosis (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>), however, in the study by Chase et al. more than 50% of patients in the intervention group were not hospitalised (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>, personal communication). In the study by Srinivasan et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>) patients with ketoacidosis or severe dehydration were excluded, but some children with ketoacidosis and severe dehydration were subsequently included after initial hospitalisation for correction of their metabolic and fluid derangement. There was no initial hospitalisation in the studies by Spaulding et. al, Simell et al. and Siminerio et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the studies described diagnostic criteria in detail. Most studies required new diagnosis with type 1 diabetes - this requirement was less clear in the study by Spaulding et al., which was dealing more generally with initiation of insulin therapy and in which the group of children and adolescents was assumed to have had type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>). This judgement is slightly uncertain as the group also contained three patients who had been diagnosed one, two and four months prior to the initiation of insulin therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All the studies had an out-patient element, but some also included home visits by members of the care team (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>). Most care teams contained a nurse, a social worker, a psychologist, a dietician, and a physician (diabetologist, paediatric endocrinologist, etc.).</P>
<P>The interventions mostly contained the following elements: 1. an individualised education programme lasting from several days to several weeks, 2. continuous psychosocial support (sometimes including regular telephone contact), 3. regular follow-up visits. The comparison intervention was hospitalisation at diagnosis (or initiation of insulin treatment) which lasted between three and twelve days. Some studies tried to ensure that the education and social support for the two groups was similar and carried out by the same teams (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>).</P>

Two gave HbA1c values with standard deviations at baseline and follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>) or at one year and follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Chase-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chase 1992</LINK>), two only reported HbA1c values at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>) or at various follow-up times but not baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>), and one gave a very incomplete set of blood glucose values both at baseline and follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>) also assessed insulin doses given.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hospital admissions and emergency visits</HEADING>

Srinivasan et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>) reported detailed hospital length of stay data only at diagnosis, but monitored complications and re admissions throughout the study.</P>

Most of the assessment instruments used in the studies by Dougherty et al., Siminerio et al. and Srinivasan et al. were previously validated scales, although some were adapted for use in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2004</LINK>). The instruments were self-administered. The development of the assessment tool in the study by Galatzer et al. was not explained; the assessment was carried out by the social worker and the psychologist (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Child/adolescent psychosocial measures</HEADING>

By contrast, Galatzer et al. reported higher adherence rates in the out-patient/home group than in the hospital group (85 versus 65.5%, P &lt; 0.001), but this effect seemed to be due to the behaviour of the average to high socioeconomic status group rather than that of the low socioeconomic status group (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>). Siminerio et al. reported high rates of adherence on the sub scales of food regulation and exercise, with no significant difference between groups, whereas the hospital group scored significantly higher on the blood glucose regulation sub scale (P &lt; 0.01) and the out-patient group scored significantly higher on the emergency precautions sub scale (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>).</P>

Galatzer et al. reported higher rates of positive adjustment in familial relationship in the out-patient/home group (84 versus 68%, P &lt; 0.02), but again, this was result was found to be due to the behaviour of the higher socioeconomic status group and not evident in the lower socioeconomic status group (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>). Siminerio et al., using the Family Assessment Device, found no significant difference between groups on the general functioning, problem solving, communication, affective involvement, and affective responsiveness sub scales at either time point assessed. However, the out-patient group had better scores on the behaviour control (P &lt; 0.005) and roles (P &lt; 0.05) sub scales at one month. No significant differences between the out-patient and hospital groups were observed for sharing of diabetes care responsibilities between children and their families (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>). Srinivasan et al.

There was a significant difference between groups at one month when the Perceived Stress Scale was administered to adolescents (older than 12 years), but this was attributable to four patients scoring unusually low in the hospital groups and the difference had disappeared at 12 and 24 months. Reported stress levels after one month approached the population mean (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>). Siminerio et al. reported no significant differences between groups on any of the sub scales of the Coping Inventory for Parents (maintaining family integration, maintaining social support, understanding medical situation through communication) at either of the time points assessed. Similarly, there were no significant differences on any of the sub scales of the Coping Inventory for Children (moody, irritable, acts out; develops competence and optimism; feels different and withdraws; complies with treatment; seeks support).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>The detailed cost analysis in the study by Dougherty et al. suggested that overall, there was no significant difference in costs between the two interventions, with the out-patient treatment being a non-significant CAN$ 48 (EUR 29.50) more expensive than the hospital treatment, when parents' time was valued at CAN$ 11.88 per hour (EUR 7.30). This cost decreases when parental time is valued more highly. Health system costs for the home care programme were CAN$ 768 (EUR 472.70) more than for the hospital care, but this was offset by parental costs being reduced by CAN$ 720 (EUR 443.20). During the first month, 52.1 hours of parental time were saved in the home group compared to the hospital group (P &lt; 0.001) and parents' out-of-pocket expenses were CAN$ 100.53 (EUR 61.90) lower than those in the hospital group, although this difference just failed to reach significance (P = 0.06). It should be noted that these calculations are based on only an average of 2.8 fewer hospital ward days in the home group compared to the hospital group (and that most hospital ward days in the intervention group occurred just after diagnosis) (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spaulding et al. compared medical costs (including salaries of staff, physician's fees, laboratory costs, standard bed rate) between the two groups and found that the costs for the out-patient/home care were almost ten times lower (CAN$ 154 (EUR 94.80) versus CAN$ 1445 (EUR 889.40)) than for the hospital group (based on 12 fewer hospital ward days in the out-patient/home group) (<LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The results of this review are inconclusive. The one high quality trial identified suggested that home-based management of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes may lead to slightly improved long term metabolic control. No differences between comparison groups were found in any of the psychosocial and behavioural variables assessed or in rates of acute diabetic complications. Parental costs were found to be decreased, while health system costs were increased, leaving total social costs virtually unchanged (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>). However, the trial did not strictly address the question of this review, as it included children in the intervention group who required hospitalisation at diagnosis. The 32 children in the intervention group were hospitalised for a total of 70 days, mostly at diagnosis, and there was only a 2.8 day difference in hospital ward days between the two groups (that is with fewer hospital days in the home-based group or a greater difference in hospital ward days, costs for the home-based group would have been lower than for the hospital group). While trials including all children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes may be sensible, as they reflect the 'real life situation', it would be desirable for such studies clearly to differentiate between children who were hospitalised and/or who were acutely ill and those who were not, so that possible differences in outcomes between those two groups can be identified. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent the findings of a single trial of limited size in a single setting can be transferred to other settings.</P>
<P>The remaining studies were all of lower quality. None of the other studies assessing metabolic control found a difference between the comparison groups. There seemed to be no differences in hospitalisations or acute diabetic complications between the out-patient/home groups and the hospital groups. Results with respect to psychosocial and behavioural variables are inconclusive, with the study by Siminerio et al. only finding significant results on some very selected sub scales of tests used (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>). In the study by Galatzer et al., the out-patient/home group did significantly better on the assessments of treatment adherence, familial relationship and sociability, but upon further analysis this only seemed to apply to selected socioeconomic subgroups, with no clear explanations offered (<LINK REF="STD-Galatzer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Galatzer 1982</LINK>). These results have to be treated with additional caution as the study does not explain what initial intervention the control group had received at diagnosis. On the whole, the data seem to suggest that out-patient/home management of type 1 diabetes in children at diagnosis does not lead to any disadvantages in terms of metabolic control, acute diabetic complications and hospitalisations, psychosocial variables and behaviour, or total costs.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 11:44:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>It has been stressed that an out-patient/home-based system is only safe and feasible if an experienced care team is readily available. In the studies assessed, care teams were generally composed of a doctor in a suitable specialty (paediatrics, diabetology, endocrinology), a nurse (with skills in teaching and diabetes), a dietician, a psychologist, and a social worker. None of the studies addressed the question what the optimum composition of a care team should be, but most seemed to regard the multi-disciplinary team as outlined above to be necessary for adequate care of the patient. However, there is little evidence to support this (for example, no comparisons of different compositions of teams). Additionally, geographical factors will play a role, for example, home care may not be feasible in rural areas with a low density of specialist diabetes clinics and care teams (<LINK REF="STD-Lowes-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lowes 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>As suggested earlier, the results may vary with socio-economic factors, and it is possible that there may be approximate equivalence overall, but that some children from more deprived areas might do better in hospital.</P>

Using Dougherty et al.'s power calculation as a rough standard, at least two studies were underpowered (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>) (although the power calculation was based on detecting a difference in HbA1c and it is unclear what power would be required for detecting a difference in the psychosocial variables). Two studies only had a follow-up of about one month (<LINK REF="STD-Siminerio-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Siminerio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1976</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two randomised controlled trials related to the current question are worth mentioning. Simell et al. (1991) compared short term (9±3 days) with long term (23±4 days) initial hospitalisation in 61 Finnish children (31 long term versus 30 short term) newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. There were no significant differences in HbA1c values between the two groups over two years (values at two years were just under 8%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in a range of psychosocial parameters (ability to function, achievement of own treatment goals, fears, anxiety, time needed to build family-confidence in coping with diabetes, grades at school, changes in siblings' status in the family, hobbies; as reported by parents). The costs (including both medical and parent costs) for the shorter stay group were £6928 and £10834 for the longer stay group over two years. The first month's expenses were twice as high in the short term as in the long term group (<LINK REF="STD-Simell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Simell 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a Swedish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Forsander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forsander 1995</LINK>), 19 children receiving traditional hospital care (for about three weeks) at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were compared with 19 children discharged to a training apartment (for about three weeks) after a very short initial stay in hospital. The child stayed at the training apartment with his/her whole family and received active support and education by a psychotherapist and diabetes team. During the five years follow-up, there was no significant difference in HbA1c values between the two groups (values ranged between 7.2 and 7.7% at five years). There was no significant difference in hospital re-admission and acute diabetic complications between the two groups. Family satisfaction, assessed after the end of the intervention, was significantly greater in the training apartment group.</P>
<P>Hatton et al. (1993) compared four centres in Canada, the USA and the UK that used both out-patient/home care and hospitalisation (or cooperated with hospitals when hospitalisation was required) in children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The study was questionnaire- and interview-based and the author compared practices, views of staff and parents and costs (main data on two centres only). Outcomes were not assessed nor were any data on the children involved in the programmes provided. The results suggest lower medical service costs for out-patient or day care compared to in-patient care in all cases assessed. Parental costs were not taken into account in detail. In psychosocial terms, the data suggested that the out-patient programmes had the advantage of avoiding the stress, trauma and disruption associated with hospitalisation. Hospitalisation was associated with fear and sleep deprivation from the point of view of the child, and exhaustion, experience of loss of control over the child, worry about the rest of the family and reduced ability to learn from the point of view of the parents. The out-patient and home environment was seen to provide more freedom and flexibility and allowed the diabetes regimen to blend in with the family lifestyle. Absence of hospital distractions was seen as being more conducive to learning. No major losses were seen by the families except for the necessity to take time off work, but this was similar for parents of children receiving in-patient or out-patient education. Health care professionals found that it was an advantage to identify problems at the home of a child that would not be evident in a hospital setting. Consistent follow-up visits (home or out-patient) were seen as contributing to improved long term diabetic control and avoidance of hospitalisations (due to ketoacidosis etc.). The main disadvantages of the out-patient programmes were seen to be unpredictable work loads and the need to work flexible hours. Physician anxiety regarding the child's initial management was increased in the out-patient setting and close collaboration of the care team and early education of parents and others in managing hypoglycaemia was deemed essential. Out-patient treatment reduced in-patient training opportunities for medical students and nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Hatton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hatton 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various other reports describing the experience of out-patient programmes also mention the reduced levels of anxiety and emotional stress on the parts of the parents and children (<LINK REF="REF-Mair-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mair 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1983</LINK>) and reduced costs as being major advantages of out-patient management of children at onset of diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Banion-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Banion 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayner-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayner 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strock 1988</LINK>). It must be kept in mind however, that some of these cost estimates are not very complete as they tend to consider only medical care costs, and not other costs, such as those incurred by parents/family or costs in setting up an out-patient system (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>).</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are insufficient high quality data to answer the question whether out-patient and/or home-based management of children who have been newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and who are not acutely ill is as good as, or better than, in-patient care. The only high quality study included hospitalised children in the intervention group and therefore a clear conclusion on non-hospitalised children alone is not possible. The studies assessed suggest that if adequate out-patient/home management can be provided, this does not lead to any disadvantages in terms of metabolic control, acute diabetic complications and hospitalisations, psychosocial variables and behaviour, or total costs. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High quality randomised controlled trials are needed to clarify the question reviewed. Studies are needed that clearly distinguish between children in the intervention group who required brief hospitalisation because they were acutely ill, and those who did not require hospitalisation, so that any possible differential effects on these two groups become evident (including reduced empowerment of the hospitalised group). Studies must be adequately powered and follow participants for at least two years. Outcome measures assessed should include measures of glycaemic control (particularly HbA1c), hospital admissions and emergency room visits, acute diabetic complications (hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis etc.), psychosocial and behavioural measures, as well as costs. Cost assessments need to take into account costs of the medical services, costs of setting up an out-patient/home care system (where not already in place) and costs to parents/families. </P>
<P>Research needs: We suggest that a randomised controlled trial of hospital admission versus out-patient/home care be carried out in children as specified above.</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>COSTS: costs were converted to costs in Euros with the exchange rate of 28.5.2003. This was done in an attempt to have a slightly more international representation of costs, but we are of course aware that the 2003 exchange rates do not correspond with the exchange rates as they would have been at the time the costs were calculated.</P>
