group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) useful for the treatment of an unpleasant side effect, tardive dyskinesia, in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems?</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic medicines. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high-dose of antipsychotic medicines, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. A group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been used as experimental treatments for tardive dyskinesia.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched for clinical trials (up to April 2017) using Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of trials. The review includes three small, short trials published in the 1990s. The trials randomised 47 people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed tardive dyskinesia because they were taking antipsychotic medicines. The treatments the participants received were the calcium channel blockers, flunarizine, nifedipine or diltiazem hydrochloride or placebo (dummy treatment).</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>A small set of very low quality data were available from three small and poorly reported trials. Currently, it is uncertain whether calcium channel blockers are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia that is caused by taking antipsychotic medicines. Therefore, the use of calcium channel blockers for this purpose remains experimental.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Evidence was limited and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. To fully investigate whether calcium channel blockers have any positive effects, there would have to be more well-designed, conducted and reported clinical trials.</P><P>This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (<A HREF="http://mcpin.org/">mcpin.org/</A>).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-01-15 14:58:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-31 12:56:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a variety of adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been among these experimental treatments.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-01 11:38:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>To determine the effects of calcium channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-01-15 14:23:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-08-01 11:38:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We selected randomised controlled trials comparing calcium channel blockers with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness who remained on their antipsychotic medication.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-31 13:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We independently extracted data and estimated risk ratios of dichotomous data or mean differences (MD) of continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left the trials early had no improvement. We also created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 14:58:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Previous versions of this review included no trials. From the 2015 search, we identified three cross-over trials that could be included. The 2017 search found no new studies relevant to this review. The included trials randomised 47 inpatients with chronic mental illnesses in the USA and China. Trials were published in the 1990s and were of short duration (six to 10 weeks). Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, and attrition and outcome data were not fully reported. Findings were sparse, no study reported on the primary outcome 'no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms,' but two small studies (37 participants) found no difference on the tardive dyskinesia symptoms scale Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores between diltiazem or flunarizine and placebo after three to four weeks' treatment (MD -0.71, 95% CI -2.68 to 1.26, very low quality evidence). Only one study randomising 20 participants reported on adverse events, and reported that there were no adverse events with flunarizine or with placebo (very low quality evidence). One study with 18 participants reported no events of deterioration in mental state with diltiazem or with placebo (very low quality evidence). No studies reported on acceptability of treatment or on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or personalised quality of life outcomes designated important to patients.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-01 14:00:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Available evidence from randomised controlled trials is extremely limited and very low quality, conclusions cannot be drawn.

However, antipsychotic medications are associated with adverse effects that negatively affect quality of life and may lead to poor compliance; thus, ultimately, increasing the risk of relapse of people taking these medications (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). Some of the most troublesome adverse effects associated with antipsychotic medications involve movement disorders. The appearance of these disorders can be extremely disfiguring, can compound stigma and is associated with poor compliance to antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>).</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-01 13:50:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterised by involuntary, repetitive body movements that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterised by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements, such as grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking. Rapid movements of the extremities and impaired movements of the fingers may also occur. TD tends to be a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which spontaneously fluctuates (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Orofacial dyskinesia and trunk and limb dyskinesia may have different responses to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1982</LINK>).</P><P>TD is often seen as an adverse effect of long-term or high-dose use of antipsychotic drugs. Within the first four years of using antipsychotic drugs, 18.5% of young adults and 31% of people over 55 years of age develop TD (<LINK REF="REF-Saltz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saltz 1991</LINK>). It has been estimated that with each year of antipsychotic use, 5% of people will show signs of TD, (i.e. 5% after one year, 10% after two years and 15% after three years) with no clear upper limit (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 1993</LINK>). The incidence of TD varies with the type of antipsychotic drug. However, among newer atypical antipsychotics, only clozapine has been shown to have a lower risk of TD than older antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rauchverger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauchverger 2007</LINK>). TD may persist for months, years or even permanently after withdrawal of the drug, and it can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-01 12:40:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>TD is difficult to treat. Several strategies have been advocated for treating the disorder, including changing an affected person's medication (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2006</LINK>), or using many different treatments. A wide range of experimental treatments has been tried for TD; most remain unproven and this is one of a series of reviews in this area (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P><P>Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) have important indications in cardiovascular disorders. Clinical trials of various calcium channel blockers in people with TD were stimulated by case reports of unexpected benefit. For instance, one study of four participants suggested that nifedipine may be effective in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Suddath-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Suddath 1991</LINK>). This suggestion was reinforced by similar low-quality studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hendrickson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrickson 1994</LINK>). However, when assessing the clinical efficacy of calcium channel blockers for TD, it should be remembered that these drugs could cause serious adverse effects, such as a decrease in blood pressure (hypotension), headaches, nausea, vomiting, depression and even an increase in signs of TD.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-01 12:40:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Antipsychotic drugs are claimed to cause an imbalance in certain chemical receptor sites in the brain, specifically dopamine sites where there is overactivity, and cholinergic sites, where there is underactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1993</LINK>). Laboratory research suggests that TD may result primarily from antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity in the nigrostriatal pathway, with the D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine receptor being most affected. Older 'typical' antipsychotics, which have greater affinity for the D<SUB>2</SUB> binding site, are associated with high risk for TD (<LINK REF="REF-Hoerger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoerger 2007</LINK>).</P><P>Animal and human experiments have suggested that intracellular calcium ions inside the brain cells play a role in the regulation of dopamine and choline activity (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dubovsky-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubovsky 1988</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers show intrinsic dopamine-blocking properties (<LINK REF="REF-Dubovsky-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubovsky 1988</LINK>), and their effect on dopamine neurotransmission has been proposed as a biological basis for their potential therapeutic effect in TD (<LINK REF="REF-Snyder-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamminga-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamminga 2002</LINK>). However, calcium channel blockers are pharmacologically different. For instance, verapamil crosses the blood-brain barrier more readily than diltiazem or nifedipine and exhibits dopamine-antagonist properties (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1988</LINK>). These differential effects stimulated clinical studies of the anti-tardive-dyskinesia effect of verapamil (<LINK REF="REF-Barrow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrow 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 1988</LINK>). For example, in 13 treatment-refractory men with schizophrenia, TD improved three weeks after supplementing their chlorpromazine treatment with verapamil, and rebounded following verapamil discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1988</LINK>). One comparison between verapamil and diltiazem demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in TD ratings with verapamil but not with diltiazem (<LINK REF="STD-Adler-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Adler 1988</LINK>). Diltiazem was also ineffective in one double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1988</LINK>), and studies with nifedipine have likewise been disappointing. Moreover, verapamil itself showed no clinically or statistically significant changes in antipsychotic-induced TD in seven adults with mental retardation (<LINK REF="STD-Ricketts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ricketts 1995</LINK>). In addition, it is feasible that any improvement related to the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of TD may result from drug interactions with coprescribed antipsychotic medication (<LINK REF="REF-Stedman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stedman 1991</LINK>).

Endpoint versus change data</HEADING><P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. However, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use MD rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4.

To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/></P><P>Note: we entered data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to determine whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies with fewer than 200 participants:</P><OL><LI>when a scale started from the finite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than 1 but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether their inclusion or exclusion change the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2, we included these data, because skew is less likely (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1601181127362367918959909337190&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Altman-1996">Altman 1996</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1601181127362367918959909337190&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>).</LI><LI>if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1601181127362367918959909337190&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Kay-1986">Kay 1986</A>)), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account.

Cross-over studies</HEADING><P>This area of research commonly uses cross-over studies where one person is randomly allocated the treatment only to be crossed over to receive the comparison after a designated time. Often a period of drug free 'washout' is used between the interventions to try and ensure that no carry-over effects of the first intervention remain before commencing the second treatment. The statistical methods for including cross-over studies in meta-analyses have developed considerably (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P><P>However, there is a clinical problem. Antipsychotic-induced TD seems to result from the prolonged blockade of specific receptor sites in the brain resulting in changes (dopamine receptor hypersensitivity) that develop over long periods of time and are likely to be slow to reverse. Should an experimental intervention successfully begin the downgrading of the dopamine receptor sites, it seems probable that this downgrading could take a long time to start and, once started, be equally slow to stop. Therefore, it seems entirely feasible that the drugs could have an effect even after they had been expelled from the body within the washout period. In addition, cross-over studies usually assume that the investigated condition should be stable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), and TD is not a stable condition. Consequently, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies in this review because of the nature of the condition under review.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated, causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).

However, if more than 50% of participants in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table by downgrading quality.

Standard deviations</HEADING><P>If SDs were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and CIs available for group means, and either 'p' value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): when only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, CI, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study's outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3. Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. Therefore, we did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we preferred to use the more sophisticated approaches (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some type of ITT data were not available. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-01 14:02:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The importance of the observed value of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic depends on the magnitude and direction of effects and the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. 'P' value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a CI for I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). An I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic estimate of 50% or greater accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic can be interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which are often the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. Therefore, we intended to use the fixed-effect model for all analyses.</P></DATA_SYNTHESIS><SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2018-01-15 14:36:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

Overall, the quality of reporting of these trials was poor (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, attrition was not clearly reported for the first cross-over phase and data were not fully reported. The small sample size and the poor reporting means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from the estimates of the effects.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-01 10:22:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Missing studies</HEADING><P>Every effort was made to identify relevant trials. However, these studies were all small and it is likely that we have failed to identify other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would also not be in favour of the intervention group. If they had been so, it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible literature. However, we do not think it likely that we have failed to identify large relevant studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Introducing bias</HEADING><P>We did have foreknowledge of the past work in this area and could have been biased in how data were managed or reported. We welcome comments or criticisms. For the 2015 review update, a new author joined the team. We re-examined excluded references and found data that could be included (see this <A HREF="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308698005_Appendix_Traceable_Extracted_Data_from_Included_Studies_of_Tardive_Dyskinesia_Reviews?channel=doi&amp;linkId=57ebe1c508ae92a5dbd051c1&amp;showFulltext=true">link</A> for exact source of data in the PDFs; last accessed 1 August 2017).

This update identified three studies to include (as discussed in <LINK TAG="SEARCH_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results of the search</LINK> and <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>), but the very sparse and low-quality evidence lead to no substantial change in the conclusions. Findings from other similar reviews (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) suggest that TD, rather than these interventions, is no longer a focus of research activity. However, studies evaluating treatments for TD are of importance to people with the problem (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and have long been ignored.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-01 12:42:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-01 10:28:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with tardive dyskinesia</HEADING><P>Based on currently available data, this systematic review provides no conclusions about the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) - except that they are purely experimental treatments. People with TD should only take such experimental interventions, with their potential to do harm, within the context of well-designed randomised controlled trials.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>In the absence of reliable evidence, clinicians prescribing calcium channel blockers for people with TD must balance the possible benefits against the potential adverse effects of the treatment. Calcium channel blockers lower people's blood pressure and may even cause symptoms of TD to increase. These drugs should only be used in a situation where their effects are closely monitored, that is, within randomised trials designed to inform practice.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policy makers</HEADING><P>There is no indication that calcium channel blockers should be introduced as part of routine treatment policy for people with TD. However, policy makers could specify that such experimental treatments only be used within the context of a trial.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">4. For funders of research</HEADING><P>Calcium channel blockers for TD would not seem to be the first set of compounds to choose to investigate within randomised studies. However, if a funding agency was intent on supporting such research, stipulation of the design outlined under 'Further trials' in <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK> and in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and reporting issues would seem prudent.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-01 12:42:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Reporting</HEADING><P>Two out of three of the included studies in this review preceded the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), so the quality of data reporting might be expected to be lower than at present. Future studies should rigorously apply the standards of reporting as outlined in CONSORT and also make all data freely available.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Further reviews</HEADING><P>As is usual with systematic reviews, several studies were identified that could be added into existing reviews or suggested comparisons for new reviews of the future. These are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Further trials</HEADING><P>Because calcium channel blockers have dopamine-blocking properties, this group of drugs could be implicated in the <I>appearance</I> of TD. This makes the necessity of further trials debatable. However, if further randomised trials are being planned, then inclusion of the following design elements would be helpful.</P><OL><LI>Use of a parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. This has benefits over cross-over studies. Trialists find it difficult to identify people with both TD and schizophrenia to participate in trials. Randomised cross-over design is used in the hope of improving the power of the study to find outcomes of interest. This design initially asks participants to be randomised to one of the experimental interventions, and then, at a prespecified time, to be crossed over to the other treatment. Conditions with a more stable time course than TD are better suited for cross-over studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>). Further difficulties are related to the carry-over effect. Unless cross-over studies include a mid-study washout period (where the person is free of treatment before starting the next arm of the study), any effect of the first intervention may continue into the second half placebo arm of the trial (the 'carry-over effect'). Also, carry-over may involve the regrowth or retreat of neuroreceptors. This slow rebalancing, if started, could continue long after all traces of intervention drugs are gone, so physiological half life of the experimental treatment may not be the only variable to consider when thinking through the issues of carry-over. TD is also an unstable condition and people with TD may not remain compliant with medication. All these factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology strong, despite the initial attraction (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</LI><LI>Trials which extend for at least six weeks.</LI><LI>Sample size which is sufficiently large to avoid false conclusions about effectiveness of intervention.</LI></OL><P>A suggested design is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-26 12:31:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors wish to thank John McGrath and John Rathbone who were involved in protocol development, and searching, data extraction, data assimilation and report writing in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2004</LINK>).

Selection of studies </P><P>KS-W and John McGrath, working independently, inspected each reference identified by the search to see if the study was likely to be relevant. The full article was obtained for articles that could possibly have been relevant or to provide clarification in cases of disagreement between the two reviewers. These articles were then inspected, again independently, to assess their relevance to this review. Where resolving disagreement by discussion was not possible, the article was added to those awaiting assessment and the authors of the study were contacted for clarification. For the 2003 update, JR independently inspected citations from the update search (2003) and identified relevant abstracts. Full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria were obtained and inspected by JR.</P><P>2. Assessment of methodological quality </P><P>The methodological quality of the trials included in this review would have been assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between the potential for bias in the results and the allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and is defined as below:</P><P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment) <BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (unclear allocation concealment) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment)</P><P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale is made up of three items:</P><P>1. Was the study described as randomised? <BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?</P><P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted or added according to the description of either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures.</P><P>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials would have been included if they had met criteria A or B of the Handbook. Additionally, a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale would have been used to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria if any studies had met the inclusion criteria.</P><P>3. Data management </P><P>3.1. Data extraction </P><P>KS and JR would have independently extracted the data of the trials included; where further clarification was needed, the authors of trials would have been contacted to provide missing data.</P><P>3.2. Assumption for those lost to follow up </P><P>Data would have been excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. Regarding the outcomes of 'aggression', 'self harm' and 'harm to others', as they are major risks of non-treated acute psychotic illness, we would have considered 5% of the people leaving the study early to have had a negative outcome. For other events, in studies with less than 50% dropout rate, people leaving early would have been considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death.</P><P>If fewer than 95% of people had been reported at two hour follow up, a sensitivity analysis would have been undertaken for primary outcomes, to see if inclusion of these studies made a substantive change in estimate of effects. If they did, then data would have been presented separately. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates after the two-hour period of follow up (25-50%) would also have been analysed in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group had resulted in a substantive change in estimate of effects of the primary outcomes, their data would not have been added to trials with less attrition, but presented separately.</P><P>3.3. Cross-over studies </P><P>This area of research commonly uses cross over studies where one person is randomly allocated the treatment only to be crossed over to receive the comparison after a certain designated time period. Often a period of drug free 'washout' is used between the interventions to try and ensure that no carry-over effects of the first intervention remain before commencing the second treatment. Since the initial publication of this review, the statistical methods for including cross-over studies in meta-analyses have developed considerably (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002c</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). For the condition of tardive dyskinesia, however, the reviewers remain against use of these data within the review (see Discussion 2. Cross-over studies).</P><P>4. Data analysis </P><P>4.1. Dichotomous - yes/no - data </P><P>For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) would have been calculated. The number needed to treat or harm statistic (NNT, NNH), and its 95% confidence interval (CI), would also have been calculated. If heterogeneity had been found (see section 5) a random-effects model would have been used.</P><P>4.2. Continuous data</P><P>4.2.1. Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards would have been applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or are obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), there is no way of telling whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale end point data, which typically cannot have negative values. If end point data was not available, the reviewers would have used change data, but these would not have been subject to a meta-analysis, and would have been reported in the 'Additional data' tables.</P><P>4.2.2. Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups would have been estimated. If heterogeneity had been found (see section 5) a random-effects model would have been used.</P><P>4.2.3. Valid scales: continuous data from rating scales would have been included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P><P>4.2.4. Endpoint versus change data </P><P>Where possible, endpoint data would have been presented and if both endpoint and change data had been available for the same outcomes, only the former would have been reported in this review. </P><P>4.2.5. Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Secondly, RevMan does not currently support meta-analytic pooling of clustered dichotomous data, even when these are correctly analysed by the authors of primary studies, since the 'design effect' (a statistical correction for clustering) cannot be incorporated.</P><P>If clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol - to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to seek intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would also have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice from the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK. Dr Julian Higgins has advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC]. If the ICC was not be reported we would have assumed it to be 0.1 (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000206/bibliography.html#CD000206-bbs2-0055">Ukoumunne 1999</A>).</P><P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P><P>5. Test for inconsistency </P><P>Firstly, consideration of all the included studies within any comparison would have been undertaken to estimate clinical heterogeneity. Then visual inspection of graphs would have been used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This would have been supplemented employing, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I-squared estimate included 75%, this would have been interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Data would then have been re-analysed using a random-effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, and results became more consistent, falling below 75% in the estimate, the studies would have been added to the main body trials. If using the random-effects model did not make a difference and inconsistency remained high, data would not have been summated, but presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.</P><P>6. Addressing publication bias </P><P>Data from all identified and selected trials would have been entered into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P><P>7. Sensitivity analyses </P><P>We intended to undertake an analysis of the primary outcomes comparing the results when completer-only data were used with analyses on an intention-to-treat basis.</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_5" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="5"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;3 studies (5 articles) included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="125"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;3 studies (5 articles) included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;45 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;745 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;745 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;704 records identified through database searching up to 2017&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;33 additional records identified from excluded studies and studies awaiting assessment, and from reference lists of other Cochrane Reviews on tardive dyskinesia&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;8 records found in 2017 search&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;700 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;40 full-text articles (39 studies) excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
