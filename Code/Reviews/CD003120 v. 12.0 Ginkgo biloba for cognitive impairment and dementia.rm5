<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three new studies have been included, Kade 1993, Napryeyenko 2005, and Schneider 2005. Two studies that were included in the previous version have been excluded, Allain 1993 and Winther 1998. Allain 1993 and Winther 1998 randomized people who were probably not demented, their degree of cognitive impairment was slight.</P>
<P>There is very little information available about Kade 1993, a cross-over trial for patients with mild or moderate signs of cerebral insufficiency. There are no results published that could be included in meta-analyses. The second trial, Napryeyenko 2005, is a large (N=395) 22-week trial for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with one dose of Ginkgo biloba, 240 mg/day, compared with placebo. Although the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the results are included in meta-analyses. The third new trial, Schneider 2005, enrolled 513 participants with moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The results have been published and are included in the meta-analyses.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-05 12:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Products of the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo biloba, have long been used in China as a traditional medicine for various disorders of health. A standardized extract is widely used in the West for the treatment of a range of conditions including memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. The mechanisms of action are thought to reflect the action of several components of the extract and include increasing blood supply by dilating blood vessels, reducing blood viscosity, modification of neurotransmitter systems, and reducing the density of oxygen free radicals.</P>

<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 20 September 2007 using the terms: ginkgo*, tanakan, EGB-761, EGB761, "EGB 761" and gingko*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, double-blind studies, in which extracts of Ginkgo biloba at any strength and over any period were compared with placebo for their effects on people with acquired cognitive impairment, including dementia, of any degree of severity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports of the included studies, pooled where appropriate and the treatment effects or the risks and benefits estimated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-05 12:17:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>36 trials were included but most were small and of duration less than three months. Nine trials were of six months duration (2016 patients). These longer trials were the more recent trials and generally were of adequate size, and conducted to a reasonable standard. Most trials tested the same standardised preparation of Ginkgo biloba, EGb 761, at different doses, which are classified as high or low. The results from the more recent trials showed inconsistent results for cognition, activities of daily living, mood, depression and carer burden. Of the four most recent trials to report results three found no difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo, and one reported very large treatment effects in favour of Ginkgo biloba.</P>
<P>There are no significant differences between Ginkgo biloba and placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis including only patients diagnosed with Alzhiemer's disease (925 patients from nine trials) also showed no consistent pattern of any benefit associated with Ginkgo biloba.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-05 12:21:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-05 12:21:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Medicinal products derived from the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo biloba, are some of the most widely used of any plant-based products. There is much literature devoted to Ginkgo biloba, and it has been investigated in many clinical trials. Many excellent reviews covering different aspects of Ginkgo biloba have been written (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Feudis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Feudis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Dongen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dongen 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The tree, from the genus Ginkgo, probably originated in China and in evolutionary terms is one of the oldest living tree species. It grows to a height of about 30 m and can survive for 1000 years. The leaf shape, with two lobes (biloba) is distinctive and unusual. The trees are dioecious (separately male or female) . It is an extremely robust tree, resisting insect and fungus attack, and survives frosts. The tree is now cultivated in many parts of the world for use of its nuts for food and the exploitation of the supposed medicinal properties of its leaves. There are large commercial plantations in Western France, South Carolina, USA, Japan, Korea and China, and these provide enough leaves to satisfy demand.</P>
<P>The active components of Ginkgo biloba consist of flavonoids, terpenoids, and terpene lactones (ginkgolides and bilobalide). Except for the ginkgolides and bilobalide, which are unique to Ginkgo biloba, these are compounds found extensively in plants. A well-defined extract, EGb 761, is produced from the ground-up leaves which contains 24% w/w (weight of active compound/total weight of extract) flavone glycosides and 6% w/w terpene lactones. It is marketed as Tanakan, Tebonin, and Rökan. Kaveri (LI 1370) is similar but with 25% w/w glycosides. Ginkgo biloba is available without prescription in the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA, being marketed as a food supplement.</P>
<P>Ginkgo biloba has been used in China as a traditional medicine for a range of conditions, including asthma, bronchitis, heart dysfunction, for at least 5000 years. Dr Schwabe introduced Ginkgo biloba into Germany in 1965 where it is now prescribed extensively for cerebral insufficiency, a diagnosis that can cover a range of conditions including memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. This use extends to France, but not to other European countries or the USA. Its properties may include protection of neuronal and myocardial cells against ischaemia and reperfusion injury. It is believed that the medicinal properties of Ginkgo biloba are due to a combination of effects and that it acts by increasing blood supply by dilating blood vessels, reducing blood viscosity, by modification of neurotransmitter systems, and by reducing the density of oxygen free radicals. Its effect on blood clotting is controversial; one of its components Ginkgolide B is an inhibitor of platelet-activating factor and there have been isolated case reports of subdural haematoma associated with high doses (<LINK REF="REF-Rowin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowin 1996</LINK>) and of hyphema (spontaneous bleeding into the anterior chamber of the eye) following combined therapy with Ginkgo extract and aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenblatt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenblatt 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main use of Ginkgo biloba is in the treatment of cerebral dysfunction. The manufacturers of Ginkgo biloba products recommend it for age-related cognitive decline and for slowing the progress of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and for other forms of dementia. Many clinical trials have been conducted to assess these potential properties and several reviews of the results have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Warburton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warburton 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopfenm_x00fc_ller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopfenmüller 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knipschild-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knipschild 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oken-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oken 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_holm-B-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søholm B 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1999</LINK>) but there is still no compelling evidence of the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba for cerebral function. New trials to assess the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba compared with placebo for dementia and cognitive decline are still being initiated.</P>

For others, such as the global impression of change, the endpoint itself is of clinical relevance as all patients will have been, by definition, at the same baseline score. The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment before randomization, but no longer than two months before.</P>

<P>A vast number of rating scales and tests have been devised to assess outcomes in clinical trials testing treatments for dementia. There is much duplication, in so far as each scale purports to assess one of the five or six main characteristics of dementia, but with varying procedures. Meta-analyses are fairly straightforward in the situation where the included studies use the same outcome measures and the method of weighted mean difference is used. When different scales are used in the studies the method of standardized mean difference is used.</P>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, and quality of life scales, there are two possible approaches. If ordinal scale data appear to be approximately normally distributed, or if the analyses reported by the investigators suggest that parametric methods and a normal approximation are appropriate, then the outcome measures will be treated as continuous variables. The second approach, which may not exclude the first, is to concatenate the data into two categories which best represent the contrasting states of interest, and to treat the outcome measure as binary. For binary outcomes, the endpoint itself is of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio is used.</P>
<P>A test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between the trials is made using a I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. If no heterogeneity is indicated then a fixed effect parametric approach is taken.</P>

<P>There are 36 included studies. The details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The duration of the studies varies from three weeks to 52 weeks, with the majority being of 12 weeks duration. The participants of the studies were diagnosed either with dementia of any type or age-related cognitive impairment. The more recent studies used modern diagnostic criteria and computerized tomographic (CT) scans for dementia; the older studies, some of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, diagnosed conditions such as organic brain syndrome using signs and symptoms questionnaires. Some German studies refer to HOPS (Hirnorganisches Psychosyndrom). This is regarded as synonymous with cerebral vessel sclerosis, cerebrovascular insufficiency or cerebral sclerosis and the typical symptoms with which a patient presents are concentration and orientation disturbances, headache, and dizziness.</P>
<P>All studies except one, <LINK REF="STD-Brautigam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brautigam 1998</LINK>, use a Ginkgo preparation based on the standard extract, EGb 761. Thus the doses in mg/day are comparable across trials. The daily dose ranged from 80 to 600 mg/day, usually less than 200 mg/day. EGb 761 contains 24 mg of total flavone glycosides and 6 mg of ginkgolides per 100 mg.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brautigam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brautigam 1998</LINK> uses a new preparation called 'Geriaforce' which has a different ratio of active ingredients to EGb 761. Geriaforce is an ethanolic extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (1:4) and contains 0.20 mg/ml total flavone glycosides and 0.34 mg/ml total ginkgolides. The low dose used in the <LINK REF="STD-Brautigam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brautigam 1998</LINK> study provided 0.57 mg total flavone glycosides /day and 0.969 mg ginkgolides/day, and the high dose provided double these amounts. The doses used in this study provided very low doses of the active components compared with the other 32 studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> enrolled 327 people with mildly to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or multiple cerebral infarcts. Treatment consisted of Ginkgo biloba 120 mg/day and primary outcome measures were ADAS-Cog, Geriatric Evaluation by Relative's Rating Instrument (GERRI) and CGIC.</P>
<P>For the meta-analyses results for doses below 200 mg/day and above were analysed separately, before combining all doses.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses attempted to pool all studies regardless of the diagnoses of the patients. The length of treatment was considered important and for the meta-analyses the data were divided into those relating to treatment of less than 12 weeks, of 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks.</P>

The second trial, <LINK REF="STD-Napryeyenko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Napryeyenko 2005</LINK>, is a large (N = 395) 22-week trial for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia with one dose of Ginkgo biloba EGb 761, 240 mg/day, compared with placebo. Results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The third new trial, <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK>, enrolled 513 participants with moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In a search for a dose-response relationship Ginkgo biloba EGb 761 was given at doses of either 120 or 240 mg/day. Primary outcome measures were ADAS-Cog and CGIC.

There is one new trial, <LINK REF="STD-DIGGER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIGGER 2008</LINK> (Dementia in General Practice Ginkgo Extract Research Trial), which randomized 176 patients with dementia, of any type. The intervention was 120 mg/day of EGb 761 compared with placebo. This intervention was crossed with another intervention, to compare standard follow up (visits at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months) with minimal follow up (shorter baseline assessment and full 6 month assessment). Thus the trial has a randomized 2 by 2 factorial design. Primary outcome measures were the ADAS-Cog and quality of life measures. Secondary outcome measures assessed activities of daily living, carer's distress due to patient's neuropsychiatric symptoms and the carer's burden of care.</P>
<P>Many of the trials received funding from Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH &amp; Co, the company that manufactures the most widely used standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba.

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:05:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Some studies included patients with any type of dementia, and patients with cognitive impairment. Other studies were more selective about the diagnoses and applied the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria. Generally after defining the diagnostic class, the studies excluded people with other serious illnesses, other mental illnesses and with other illness that could be causing the memory problems. Many studies excluded people with a history of abuse of alcohol, drugs or medication. Patients taking vasoactive drugs, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, cholinergics, antidepressants and anti-Parkinson's medication were often excluded, but some studies did not exclude the use of these drugs. Severity of cognitive impairment or dementia was commonly assessed by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>.</P>
<P>There are a group of studies that diagnose and assess patients using a list of typical symptoms. These trials are <LINK REF="STD-Arrigo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Arrigo 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Arrigo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Arrigo 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Br_x00fc_chert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brüchert 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eckmann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Eckmann 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eckmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Eckmann 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Halama-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Halama 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Halama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Halama 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hofferberth-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hofferberth 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hofferberth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hofferberth 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1991</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Vorberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vorberg 1989</LINK>. The patients are often described as having the vascular component of brain insufficiency (diffuse or localised) which manifests with transitory ischaemic attacks, tinnitus, dizziness, headache, anxiety, memory deficiency, forgetfulness, concentration problem, tiredness, decline in capacity, lack of motivation, depression. Patients are asked by a physician to grade the severity of each of these symptoms as, none, little, moderate or severe. Each patients is assessed at baseline, endpoint and sometimes at intermediate times. The baseline assessment usually determines whether the patient meets the criteria for the organic brain insufficiency and thus inclusion in the study. After treatment a patient is assessed as better or not better. The number of improved patients is enumerated for each treatment group for each symptom, to arrive at the treatment effect.</P>
<P>This procedure is unsatisfactory from several points of view. The method of questioning the patient is never described and therefore the situation is similar to that of using an unvalidated, unpublished rating scale. It is often not clear what form the data take and how they were analysed. We shall summarise the findings as reported by the investigators but it is not possible in many cases to enter the data into the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The initial report of the study <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> causes concern because participants could be removed from the trial if that they appeared to be declining. "Each subject was to complete 52 weeks, but if at any time a subject showed worsening of functioning or impairment, as assessed by an increase of 1 point on the CGIC, the subject could be dropped from the study and offered admission to an uncontrolled open-label humanitarian protocol. However, the investigator was encouraged to maintain the patient in the double-blind phase for at least 6 months". In response to our request for further information about this study, Dr Le Bars has confirmed that the humanitarian treatment protocol was open-label treatment with Ginkgo (120 mg/day). This is not a satisfactory procedure in a randomized trial. <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> had a greater percentage of drop-outs than other trials, and in addition to a 'per protocol' analysis, an ITT analysis based on last observation carried forward was carried out, in which data missing at 52 weeks were replaced by the last evaluable assessment after a minimum of 20 weeks of treatment. The investigators selected the ITT analyses as providing the primary criteria of efficacy, the reason given being that a relatively low proportion of patients completed the 52 weeks, and there was a difference in the proportion completing in each group. The results of the two analyses differ, especially at 52 weeks, but it is difficult to interpret these differences without knowing how any bias due to selective removal of non-responders from the treatment group was balanced against bias due to selective removal of participants who showed deterioration on placebo. However, the imbalance between treatment and control groups due to withdrawal on account of "intervention ineffective" emerged only after 26 weeks. The 26-week results of this trial have therefore been regarded as suitable for inclusion.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK> performed an unplanned subgroup analysis that has to be regarded as hypothesis-raising rather than hypothesis-testing and so not included in meta-analysis. After finding no statistically significant treatment effect in their planned analyses the investigators postulated that this might be because their placebo group had been unusual in showing less decline than expected. They therefore separated out and analysed a group of participants with neuropsychiatric features at presentation, a feature associated with more rapid deterioration. However the rate of deterioration in their placebo group of 0.9 points on the ADAS-Cog over six months was not strikingly different from the 1.03 shown in Figure 2 of <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> that did not raise similar concerns. </P>
<P>The earlier studies provide few details of the methods of randomization and blinding. The later studies provide more detail. <LINK REF="STD-DIGGER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIGGER 2008</LINK> describes the placebo, the method of randomization and the procedures used to assess the success of blinding. </P>
<P>The percentage of patients leaving a study before end of treatment varied from zero to 30, but was mostly much lower. Loss of patients was not a serious problem, except for the <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> study.</P>

<P>Although there are 36 included studies (total participants = 4423), only 30 contribute data to the meta-analyses, and of these 15 studies contribute very little.</P>
<P>There was no consistent evidence of a higher incidence of adverse effects associated with Ginkgo biloba in comparison with placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-Napryeyenko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Napryeyenko 2005</LINK> the incidence of dizziness, headache, angina, and rise in blood pressure were significantly higher in the placebo group.</P>
<P>Overall, there are no significant differences between Ginkgo biloba and placebo in the proportions of participants dropping out before the scheduled end of treatment. The percentage of patients leaving a study before end of treatment varied from zero to 30, and was approximately related to duration of the treatment period, the longer studies lost a higher percentage of patients.</P>
<P>The smaller, shorter, and older studies lost few people, often none at all. Where there were losses, the completers analyses were reported. Therefore completers analyses are usually included in the meta-analyses where these studies contribute. <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dongen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dongen 2000</LINK> report the analyses of the ITT-LOCF data which are included in the review. <LINK REF="STD-DIGGER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIGGER 2008</LINK> used methods of multiple imputation for the missing values for the ITT analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>A secondary objective, as stated in the protocol for the review, was that diagnostic subgroups would be examined if possible. When the first version of the review was written very few of the included trials identified the cause of the dementia or memory loss of the patients. The more recent trials include the diagnoses, and the trials usually include patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with vascular dementia but not all present results for Alzheimer's disease or vascular causes separately. At the time of the 2008 update a subgroup analysis for those with Alzheimer's disease was carried out.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:05:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Several of the earlier smaller studies found positive effects of Ginkgo biloba that have not been confirmed in more recent trials. We are unable to exclude the possibility of publication bias affecting earlier studies. There is no consistent pattern in the results from the more recent, better quality trials. In meta-analysis the CGIC shows benefit at 24 weeks, but not at 12, the tests for cognitive function and activities of daily living show benefit at 12 but not 24 weeks. The results from the meta-analyses reveal no effect of dose, there appears to be no difference between high and low dose. <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK> has two treatment arms, 120 and 240 mg/day and there are no significant differences between the two doses for all outcomes. Some of the results showing benefit are based on only one trial, for example the treatment effect for the low dose (<LINK REF="STD-Mazza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mazza 2006</LINK>) and high dose (<LINK REF="STD-Napryeyenko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Napryeyenko 2005</LINK>) for the SKT measure of cognition, but the meta-analyses for another measure of cognition (ADAS-Cog) show no treatment benefit. In recent trials, the results of <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> were not confirmed by <LINK REF="STD-DIGGER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIGGER 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dongen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dongen 2000</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Le-Bars-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Le Bars 1997</LINK> found a significant difference between treatment and control groups in GERRI scores but not in CGIC. Similar inconsistent results emerged from a subgroup analysis which included only patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.</P>
<P>The results of the recent study by <LINK REF="STD-Napryeyenko-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Napryeyenko 2005</LINK> are anomalous. It is the only study to have restricted participants to people with neuropsychiatric features of dementia. This design was presumably stimulated by the subgroup analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK> that led to the hypothesis that patients with neuropsychiatric features decline more rapidly than average and would benefit more from Ginkgo biloba. The authors recruited 400 such patients from sixteen Ukraine clinics into a six-month trial that began in June 2003 and was completed in August 2004. The results from this study were strongly in favour of Ginkgo biloba and so different statistically from the findings of the non-selective studies, the treatment effects were much larger and the standard deviations of the outcomes measures were much smaller. The much smaller study, <LINK REF="STD-Mazza-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mazza 2006</LINK>, also showed much greater treatment effects and smaller standard deviations than the other studies. When these two studies were removed from the meta-analyses of cognitive function and activities of daily living the very high degree of heterogeneity was much reduced, and any significant treatment effect previously demonstarted for Ginkgo biloba was no longer present. The most recent study to report results, <LINK REF="STD-DIGGER-2008" TYPE="STUDY">DIGGER 2008</LINK>, found no significant treatment effects for any outcome.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, as pointed out by <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2005</LINK>, further trials of Ginkgo biloba in Europe and North America are likely to prove difficult to the point of impracticability now that the cholinesterase inhibitors are established treatment. In view of the inconsistency of results so far obtained, data from further trials designed along conventional lines are unlikely to prove conclusive. Unless some radically new findings emerge from trials of Ginkgo biloba still in progress, researchers in dementia and cognitive impairment will probably give priority to more consistently promising forms of treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-04-23 10:17:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Ginkgo biloba appears to be safe in use with no excess adverse effects compared with placebo. The evidence that Ginkgo biloba has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-12 10:56:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Further conventionally designed clinical trials of Ginkgo biloba in the treatment of acquired cognitive impairment would be unlikely to prove useful. Further studies restricted to people with neuropsychiatric features of dementia are needed.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Feedback</P>
<P>The review covers the relevant literature on Ginkgo biloba in cognitive impairment and dementia and provides an overview of the results of the largest, the most important and the most recent trials. Meta-analyses show benefits of the Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 in global assessments, cognitive tests and activities of daily living (ADL) scales, yet the conclusion is reserved. Since the conclusion inherently depends on the methods, the presentation and evaluation of the results, some comments appear to be warranted. Giving careful consideration to the distinctive features of the studies could lead to more specific results.</P>
<P>Methodological issues</P>
<P>Studies in patients with merely subjective complaints about memory or concentration, studies in patients with cognitive impairment proven by neuropsychological testing and studies in patients with dementia are included in the same meta-analyses. From a clinical point of view, this is both surprising and inappropriate because these three groups of patients differ from each other with respect to the cognitive and non-cognitive domains affected, the severity of impairment, the type of progression of impairment and the natural rate of deterioration. Different instruments are required to adequately measure the efficacy of treatments, and the domains of interest vary with the type of disease.</P>
<P>The review includes studies on Ginkgo products of essentially different qualities. The proportions of flavone glycosides and terpene lactones of the product Geriaforce used by Brautigam 1998 differ markedly from those of the extract EGb 761, and the daily intake of flavone glycosides and terpene lactones even in the low-dose studies of EGb 761 was manifold higher than under Geriaforce treatment in the study by Brautigam 1998. It is therefore unfeasible to jointly analyse studies with Geriaforce and low-dose EGb 761 under the heading "less than 200 mg/day" in one and the same meta-analysis. The extract is the active substance in a phytomedical product and it is not possible to make any claim of efficacy or inefficacy for a group of products whose bioequivalence has not been proven.</P>
<P>In the third paragraph of the "Discussion" it is pointed out that the results from the study by Napryeyenko 2007 are so different from those of other studies that they cannot be merged in a meta-analysis. Do not patient characteristics and treatments, even more than results, determine whether studies can be merged in a meta-analysis? This raises the question why the results from Le Bars 1997 and Schneider 2005 can be merged, although the patients of the latter were selected from a restricted basic population and according to much more rigorous criteria. Even more astonishing is why the results from studies in subjects with merely subjective complaints (Brautigam 1998) or AAMI (van Dongen 2003) can be merged in a meta-analysis with those from studies in patients with dementia (Hofferberth 1994, Mancini 1993, Kanowski 1996, Le Bars 1997, Mazza 2006, Napryeyenko 2007).</P>
<P>Evidence-based medicine is defined as "the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients" (Sackett 1996, Brit Med J 312:71-2). An individual patient may have dementia or aging-related cognitive impairment or subjective memory complaints, and treatment decisions are to be taken accordingly. So, how useful are standardised or weighted mean differences obtained by meta-analysis of effects of different drug products tested in a variety of diseases and ailments to make a decision about the appropriate treatment for an individual patient?</P>
<P>The studies by Allain 1993 and Winther 1998 are no longer included in the<BR/>updated review because the people enrolled were probably not demented and<BR/>their degree of cognitive impairment was slight. Considering that the subjects enrolled by Allain were required to have subjective cognitive complaints and low performance in a cognitive test and that the subjects enrolled by Winther had to have MMSE scores between 22 and 28, which roughly corresponds to mild cognitive impairment, the question arises why the study by Brautigam 1998 still was included. The subjects enrolled by Brautigam were required to have no more than subjective complaints about memory and/or concentration.</P>
<P>Errors and misleading wording</P>
<P>The last sentence of the "Results" section states that there were no data available on measures of depression and in the abstract it is said that no<BR/>study assessed mood and function separately. Yet there are data on standard<BR/>measures of depression from three trials. In the studies by Kanowski 1996<BR/>and Schneider 2005, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), respectively, were administered to ensure that no patients with clinically significant<BR/>depression were included and that improvements in the cognitive domain are<BR/>not due to improvements in depression. That was in line with former<BR/>recommendations of the FDA and the German drug agency. In the study by<BR/>Napryeyenko 2007 patients with mild to moderate depression were admitted<BR/>since more recent studies (Powlishta 2004, Arch Neurol 61:1265-68) had<BR/>demonstrated that even in mild dementia depression has no impact on<BR/>cognitive performance. Hence, depression was a secondary outcome in this<BR/>study.</P>
<P>As a matter of fact, the findings are not as inconsistent and contradictory<BR/>as presented in the "Results" section and in the abstract. There is no contradiction when there are significant differences in the CGIC after 22-26 weeks, but not after 12 weeks. The CGIC is not the most sensitive measure to demonstrate benefits of anti-dementia treatments, and it appears that it just requires more than 12 weeks of differential development of treatment groups for benefits to become clearly discernible. That there is significant superiority of EGb 761 in the cognitive domain after 12 weeks, but not after 24 weeks is only true if the ADAS-cog results of two studies (Le Bars 1997, Schneider 2005) are picked out selectively, which would have to be justified. Looking at the SKT, which was used in the studies by Kanowski 1996, van Dongen 2003, Mazza 2006 and Napryeyenko 2007, there clearly is a significant difference in favour of Ginkgo at 22-26 weeks. Similarly, the statement in the discussion that in ADL scales there was a benefit after 12 weeks, but not after 24 weeks is only true for one single meta-analysis, i.e. for doses above 200 mg/day under exclusion of the data from Napryeyenko 2007. For doses below 200 mg/day, for doses above 200 mg/day including data from Napryeyenko 2007 and for the overall analysis<BR/>there are significant differences in favour of Ginkgo.</P>
<P>Comments</P>
<P>Under "Methodological Quality" the opinion is expressed that the rate of deterioration in the placebo group of the study by Schneider 2005 as measured by the ADAS-cog was not strikingly different from that found in the study by Le Bars 1997. This is true for the bare numbers. Yet, the AD patients enrolled by Le Bars 1997 had a mean baseline ADAS-cog score of 20.0 and 52% scored above 23 on the MMSE, i.e. they had very mild dementia. It is well known that patients in the early stage of AD deteriorate slowly under naturalistic conditions, whereas those with moderate AD usually deteriorate much faster (Stern 1994, Am J Psychiatry 151:390-6; Schmeidler 1998, Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 12:146-51). In the study by Schneider 2005 the mean ADAS-cog at baseline was 24.8 and two thirds of the patients scored below 20 on the MMSE, i.e. most of the patients were already in the stage of moderate dementia or at least in the transition from mild to moderate dementia. Hence, it was justified to expect that those patients deteriorate more quickly than they actually did.</P>
<P>The statement in the "Discussion" saying that "the results of Le Bars 1997<BR/>were not confirmed by van Dongen 2000 or Schneider 2005" is surprising. How<BR/>can a study in which most of the patients had AAMI confirm or contradict the results of a study in patients with dementia? The study by Schneider 2005 does not confirm the findings from Le Bars 1997, but the patient sample and the circumstances of recruitment were clearly different. The positive findings of Le Bars 1997 are in line with those of Kanowski 1996 and were later confirmed by Napryeyenko 2007. Hence, one dementia study with inconclusive results is counterbalanced by three modern dementia studies with positive outcomes.</P>

<P>We would like to thank Robert Hoerr for his comments on the review. We have considered his points carefully.</P>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive decline. Most people with memory problems or dementia who take Ginkgo biloba are self-prescribing. There are many Ginkgo biloba products available. It is hoped that this review answers some of the questions this population may have. The protocol written for the review of Ginkgo biloba for cognitive impairment and dementia makes clear that the intention was to include trials whose participants had a wide range of diagnoses, and were treated with Ginkgo biloba in some form. A secondary objective was to look at subgroups, those with different diagnoses. When the review was first written it would not have been possible to conduct meta-analyses for diagnostic groups, there were too few participants in trials with identifiable types of dementia. </P>
<P>Since the first review was carried out several new trials of Ginkgo biloba have been completed. These are larger than the older studies and the diagnoses of the included patients have been more precisely defined, often using accepted criteria. It may be possible now to carry out these subgroup analyses. We intend to address this issue in the next update of the review.</P>
<P>To address Robert Hoerr's specific comments.</P>
<P>1.'That it is incorrect to state that there are no data on depression' - <BR/>There are three trials named by Robert Hoerr as having data on depression, Kanowski 1996, Schneider 2005, and Napryeyenko 2005. Kanowski 1996 does not assess depression as an outcome measure. Schneider 2005 does assess depression as an outcome measure and although it is reported that there are no significant differences between the treatment groups and placebo the standard deviations of the treatment effects are missing, and therefore this outcome cannot be reported in an analysis. Napryeyenko assesses depression as an outcome measure but the data were not available at the time the review was updated. The only published report of this trial reports the results for the SKT. Therefore it is correct to say that there are no data available on measures of depression, but we shall make efforts to obtain the unpublished data on depression.</P>
<P>2.'That the findings are not as inconsistent and contradictory as presents in the "Results" section and in the abstract'.<BR/>The results do not add up to a consistent conclusion, either across outcomes or within outcomes. The meta-analysis for SKT and activities of daily living (higher dose after 22-24 weeks of treatment) have I2 values of 95% and 96% respectively. This indicates serious heterogeneity between the studies which appears to be due to the inclusion of the Napryeyenko study. The results from this study are inconsistent with those of the other studies.</P>
<P>3.'Under "Methodological Quality" the opinion is expressed that the rate of deterioration in the placebo group of the study by Schneider 2005 as measured by the ADAS-cog was not strikingly different from that found in the study by Le Bars 1997'.<BR/>The mean baseline MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores of the Schneider study were 18 and 23 respectively, of the Le Bars study 21 and 20. The differences are not great. The change in ADAS-Cog over approximately 6 months was 0.9 in the Schneider study and 1.0 in the Le Bars. The result from the Schneider study does not seem to be exceptional.<BR/>Perhaps another point should be made, and that is if the placebo group decline less than expected the treatment group will also. This is a randomized trial. If the decline were less rapid than expected it would not affect the estimate of the treatment effect which in this study was not significantly different from zero.</P>
<P>4.'The statement in the "Discussion" saying that "the results of Le Bars 1997 were not confirmed by van Dongen 2000 or Schneider 2005" is surprising.'<BR/>I refer again to my more general comment that this review was intended to cover dementia of all types, and cognitive impairment. There has been no attempt to conduct meta-analyses of diagnostic subtypes.</P>
