<P>Low doses of aspirin do help prevent pre-eclampsia, and some of its complications.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a condition in pregnancy involving high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It can lead to serious complications. As it affects blood clotting, antiplatelets (drugs like aspirin which can prevent blood clots) are used to prevent pre-eclampsia. The review of 59 trials, involving 37,560 women, found low doses of aspirin reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia by about a sixth (17%), with a similar lowering in the risk of the baby dying (14%) and a small lowering in the risk of being born too early (8%). Doses up to 75 mg appear to be safe. Higher doses might be better, but adverse effects may also increase.</P>

<P>Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation.

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 1), EMBASE (1994 to November 2005) and handsearched congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Quasi-random studies were excluded.

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifty-nine trials (37,560 women) are included. There is a 17% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((46 trials, 32,891 women, relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.89), number needed to treat (NNT) 72 (52, 119)). Although there is no statistical difference in RR based on maternal risk, there is a significant increase in the absolute risk reduction of pre-eclampsia for high risk (risk difference (RD) -5.2% (-7.5, -2.9), NNT 19 (13, 34)) compared with moderate risk women (RD -0.84 (-1.37, -0.3), NNT 119 (73, 333)). </P>
<P>Antiplatelets were associated with an 8% reduction in the relative risk of preterm birth (29 trials, 31,151 women, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97); NNT 72 (52, 119)), a 14% reduction in fetal or neonatal deaths (40 trials, 33,098 women, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98); NNT 243 (131, 1,666) and a 10% reduction in small-for-gestational age babies (36 trials, 23,638 women, RR 0.90, 95% CI0.83 to 0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups for any other outcomes. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-10 22:55:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is defined as high blood pressure associated with proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 1990</LINK>). It occurs in the second half of pregnancy and complicates between 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Pre-eclampsia can also affect other maternal organs, leading to problems in liver, kidneys and brain, and to abnormalities of the clotting system. As the placenta also is involved, there are increased risks for the baby. The most common are poor growth due to inadequate blood supply through the damaged placenta, and the problems of prematurity (related either to the spontaneous onset of preterm labour or to early delivery to protect the mother or the fetus). Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol of interventions for preventing pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 05</LINK>).</P>
<P>High blood pressure is common during pregnancy, and around 10% of women will have their blood pressure recorded as above normal at some point before delivery. For women who develop raised blood pressure but have no proteinuria or any other complication, pregnancy outcome is very similar to that for women who have normal blood pressure. Raised blood pressure alone occurring for the first time during pregnancy is known as pregnancy-induced hypertension, or gestational hypertension. One of the difficulties in caring for women with pregnancy-induced hypertension is that it is so common, and there is no reliable way of predicting who will progress to more severe disease. Therefore, very large numbers of these women are admitted to hospital or to day-care units for assessment, or receive antenatal care designed for high-risk women. Women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia usually feel well. It is only when blood pressure is very high (greater than 170 mmHg systolic or greater than 110 mmHg diastolic) or they develop symptoms of severe pre-eclampsia, such as headache, epigastric pain or visual disturbances, that they may feel unwell. </P>
<P>Although the outcome following pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (the rare occurrence of seizures superimposed on pre-eclampsia) is good for most women, particularly in the developed world, these conditions remain major causes of maternal mortality. Over half a million women die each year of pregnancy related causes, and 99% of these deaths occur in the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Mahler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfield--1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfield 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). An estimated 10% to 15% of the maternal deaths in developing countries are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1992a</LINK>), as are 15% of the direct obstetric deaths in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Perinatal mortality is also increased (<LINK REF="REF-Ananth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dept-of-Health-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dept of Health 1996</LINK>). There is little good quality information about morbidity for either mother or baby, but it is likely that this too is high.</P>
<P>The origins of pre-eclampsia are probably in faulty implantation of the placenta early in pregnancy. The primary lesion is thought to be deficient trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries in the uterus during the second trimester, leading to underperfusion of the circulation between uterus and placenta, with consequent reduction in blood flow through the placenta (placental ischaemia) (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1991</LINK>). The resulting placental damage is thought to lead to release of factors into the maternal circulation, which are responsible for the maternal syndrome. Activation of platelets and the clotting system may occur early in the course of the disease, before clinical symptoms develop (<LINK REF="REF-Janes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1978</LINK>). Deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, with excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Bussolino-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussolino 1980</LINK>) have also been demonstrated to occur in pre-eclampsia. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia and that, for women who already have the disorder, the risk of adverse events might be reduced. </P>
<P>These hypotheses were first tested in several small randomised trials which reported very striking benefits in terms of reducing the risk of hypertension and proteinuria. The trials were too small to provide reliable information about other more substantive outcomes, such as perinatal mortality, although there were anecdotal reports of women exposed to aspirin which suggested promising benefits. In addition, there was no information about the potential hazards of this therapy, such as a possible increased risk of bleeding for both the woman and her baby, and possible adverse effects on infant and child development. The promising results of early trials of low-dose aspirin led to several large trials being conducted in various parts of the world. Before these results became available, however, the use of low-dose aspirin had already become relatively widespread for women considered to be at increased risk of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Over 35,000 pregnant women have been entered into randomised trials evaluating low-dose aspirin. In the past, several systematic reviews have attempted to summarise these results (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imperiale-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperiale 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leitich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitich 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharts_x002d_Engel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharts-Engel 1992</LINK>), although none of these are complete or up to date. Nevertheless, there has been a reasonable consensus that, while low-dose aspirin appears to be safe, it is not usefully effective at protecting low-moderate risk women from developing pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-BroughtonPipkin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">BroughtonPipkin 1996</LINK>). Several issues remain controversial, however. These include whether antiplatelet agents are beneficial for women with a particularly high risk of developing severe pre-eclampsia (those with a history of previous early onset severe disease or with diabetes, for example) and whether dose, type of preparation or starting treatment early in pregnancy are factors that substantially influence effectiveness. Also, there is concern that enthusiasm for the use of low-dose aspirin may have led to speedy publication of small positive trials in high profile journals, with small negative trials taking far longer to appear, and then doing so only in more obscure publications (<LINK REF="REF-BroughtonPipkin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">BroughtonPipkin 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>A wide variety of other interventions have been suggested for possible prevention of pre-eclampsia. Other Cochrane reviews cover calcium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2006</LINK>), magnesium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2001</LINK>), protein intake (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>), nutritional advice (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>) salt intake (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1999b</LINK>) marine oils (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2006</LINK>) and antioxidants (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005</LINK>). Although some of these interventions are promising, to date none have been clearly shown to have clinically worthwhile benefits.</P>
<P>The aims of this review are (i) to identify as many of both the published and unpublished antiplatelet trials as possible and (ii) to estimate the benefits and hazards of antiplatelet agents when used for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. </P>
<P>If antiplatelets were effective, our second objective was to determine which of these agents was best and to compare antiplatelet agents with other interventions. These analyses are not currently included in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pregnancy-induced hypertension</HEADING>
<P>There is no overall difference in the risk of gestational hypertension in the 34 trials (20,701 women) reporting this outcome (relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.03). Heterogeneity in this analysis is borderline (I<SUP>2</SUP> 49.5%), and using a random-effects model this result achieves statistical significance (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94).</P>
<P>There is a statistically significant reduction in risk in one prespecified subgroup of 838 high-risk women enrolled in 12 small trials that reported gestational hypertension ((RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70), risk difference (RD) -13% (-18.6, -8.1), NNT 8 (5, 12)). This result is consistent using a random-effects model (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Proteinuric pre-eclampsia</HEADING>
<P>Overall there is a 17% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((46 trials with 32,891 women, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.89), RD -1.39% (-1.94, -0.24), NNT 72 (52, 119)). This reduction in risk is statistically significant regardless of whether the woman was at moderate or high risk, gestation at trial entry, whether or not she was in a placebo controlled trial.</P>
<P>Although there is a trend for the relative risk reduction to be greater in women at high risk of pre-eclampsia at trial entry (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.85) than those at moderate risk (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95), the confidence intervals overlap and there is no clear statistical difference. However, there is a significant increase in the absolute risk reduction and consequent reduction in number needed to treat to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia in the high-risk women (RD -5.2% (-7.5, -2.9), NNT 19 (13, 34)) compared with moderate-risk women (RD -0.84 (-1.37, -0.3), NNT 119 (73, 333)). In the nine trials (1587 women) that were not placebo controlled, the reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia was significantly greater (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.71) than in the 34 placebo controlled trials (31,003 women) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.92).</P>
<P>Compared with trials using 75 mg or less of aspirin, there is a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia in trials using higher doses of antiplatelet agents. In the 21 trials (26,984 women) that evaluated 75 mg/day or less of aspirin the RR is 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.95), in the 17 trials (3061 women) evaluating more than 75 mg/day of aspirin the RR is 0.64 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.80) and in the five trials of 506 women evaluating more than 75 mg/day of aspirin plus dipyridamole the RR is 0.30 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.60). No trials make a direct comparison of different doses of aspirin. A few small trials have combined aspirin with dipyridamole. In view of the small numbers, the results in this subgroup should be interpreted with caution.</P>

The size of this reduction was similar across all the subgroups, except for those trials that included women at high risk (20 trials, 4797 women, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90), although this does not reach statistical significance. In the 10 trials that did not use a placebo (1605 women), the reduction in risk is statistically significantly greater (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There continues to be controversy about the role of aspirin for prevention of pre-eclampsia. This review summarises data from 37,560 women from 59 trials. It demonstrates that, although the benefits are not as high as was hoped for in the early 1990s, low-dose aspirin does reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and its consequences. As these benefits are small-moderate, depending on the outcome. Further research is required to help determine for which women aspirin would be most worthwhile. </P>
<P>Antiplatelet agents (primarily aspirin in this review) are associated with a moderate (17%) reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia. The confidence intervals (CI) for this point estimate suggest the true effect could be a reduction of as much as 23%, or as little as 11%. For women who were high risk at trial entry, antiplatelet agents are associated with a 25% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia (95% CI 34% to 15% reduction). For moderate-risk women, antiplatelet agents are associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia (95% CI 21% to 5% reduction). Based on absolute risk reduction, 72 women (95% CI 52 to 119 women) need to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia. For high-risk women this drops to 19 who need to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia (95% CI 13 to 34 women) and for moderate-risk women it rises to 119 women (95% CI 73 to 333 women).</P>
<P>The risk of the baby dying, either before or after delivery, is reduced by 14%. There is a small (8%) overall reduction in the risk of preterm birth, but this seems to be a reduction in the risk of any birth before 37 weeks without any clear evidence of a reduction in the risk of being born before 32 weeks. The relative of having a small-for-gestational-age baby is also reduced by 10%.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that the promising early systematic reviews of antiplatelet therapy may have reflected publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-BroughtonPipkin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">BroughtonPipkin 1996</LINK>). Graphs (called funnel plots) of the effect size against sample size for each trial have been consistently asymmetric, suggesting that small negative trials may be missing. In this review, most of the small positive trials were published in the 1980s and early 1990s. It remains possible that small negative trials conducted at that time have still not been published. Interestingly, the recently conducted small studies added in this update are also largely positive. The funnel plot of the data for pre-eclampsia therefore continues to be asymmetric. The funnel plot for data on stillbirths and neonatal deaths is more symmetric, however. It should be noted that publication bias is not the only cause of funnel plot asymmetry and it can also be due to differences in maternal characteristics in small compared to large trials.</P>
<P>Although the subgroups presented in this review were all prespecified, their results should be interpreted with caution. The large number of subgroups and outcomes means that at least a few of the statistically significant results may merely reflect the play of chance (with a P value of 0.05, one in 20 can be expected to be positive, purely by chance). Where only a proportion of eligible trials reported a particular outcome and large numbers of women are missing, there is also the potential to be misled by bias. </P>
<P>To prevent or delay the onset of pre-eclampsia, aspirin may need to be started before implantation and trophoblast invasion are complete. In this review, data are presented by before and after 20 weeks, and there is little evidence of any clinically worthwhile difference. It may be that the crucial time for administration is before 16 or 12 weeks, but this review provides little to support that hypothesis. There is promising evidence that higher doses of aspirin may be more effective, but this will require careful evaluation as risks may also be increased. The current reassurance about safety applies only to lower doses. As would be expected, trials with no placebo tended to report more positive effects than those that used a placebo. </P>
<P>These trials involved a wide range of maternal risk both within and between trials. In this aggregate data review, it is not possible to assess the effects of antiplatelet agents for women with specific conditions or risk factors. Such an analysis would require a review based on data from individual women. The trialists who conducted the studies in this review have formed a collaborative group (the PARIS Group) to conduct a review based on data from individual women. The protocol for this review has been published (<LINK REF="REF-PARIS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">PARIS 2005</LINK>), and the results are expected to be available in 2007. Future updates of this Cochrane review will therefore incorporate data from individual women.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-10 22:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Overall, administration of antiplatelet agents to women at risk leads to a 17% reduction in the risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Amongst women in the primary prevention trials, for every 72 women treated, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented. However, for high-risk women only 19 need to treated to prevent one case . There are also smaller reductions in the risk of preterm birth (8%) and of fetal or neonatal death (14%) with larger numbers of women needed to be treated to prevent such outcomes. Overall, adverse effects appear to be low but under reporting makes it difficult to be confident about this, especially where higher doses are used. As most of the evidence relates to low-dose aspirin, this is the antiplatelet agent that should be used in clinical practice for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Starting aspirin before 12 weeks or using higher doses, or both, cannot be recommended for clinical practice until more information is available about safety.</P>
<P>The evidence presented in this review should be summarised and made available to women at risk of pre-eclampsia. The decision about whether to take aspirin during pregnancy should then be made in consultation between the woman and her doctor. As the reductions in risk are small-moderate, relatively large numbers of women will need to be treated to prevent a single adverse outcome. However, from a public health perspective even these moderate benefits may be worthwhile, and low-dose aspirin may be worth considering for more widespread use. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-10 22:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several questions remain about the role of low-dose aspirin. These include whether there are particular high-risk subgroups of women who might have greater benefit, whether starting treatment before 12 weeks would have additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects, and whether a higher dose would be more effective. Many of these unresolved questions could be most efficiently answered by a review that analysed data from the individual women in the trials presented here, rather than undertaking further trials. As discussed above, results of this review will be available soon.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>[Aspirin has clinically significant benefit in high risk groups - Summary NNT can mislead clinicians and women]</P>
<P>Editor - The systematic review (1;2) of antiplatelet drugs for prevention of pre-eclampsia found statistically significant reduction in pre-eclampsia and other outcomes such as fetal or neonatal death. The authors concluded that the benefit was 'small to moderate' and the implication for practice was that 'relatively large numbers of women will need to be treated to prevent a single adverse outcome'. With the numbers of women needed to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia reported as 100 (95% CI 59 to 167), clinicians (and women) might not think treatment worthwhile.</P>
<P>However, calculating numbers needed to treat from pooled meta-analysis data may be inappropriate, if it is possible to identify subgroups of patients with substantially differing baseline risks(3). In women with high levels of baseline risk, and assuming constant relative risk from treatment, numbers needed to treat are smaller (4), and both clinicians and women may be much more likely to wish to use aspirin to prevent pre-eclampsia. It has been suggested(1;2) that meta-analysis of individual patient data would be useful both in identifying high-risk subgroups, and estimating the benefit they derive from antiplatelet treatment. However, such meta-analyses generally take a long time to complete(5). What should clinicians do in the mean time?</P>
<P>We can see no reason for thinking that the reduction in relative risk for various risk levels will be substantially different. If high-risk (or low risk) women can be identified, by any means, specific numbers needed to treat can then be generated by using pooled relative risk estimates from reviews of effectiveness(4), making the decision to treat (or not) more appropriate and, in this particular case, probably more clear-cut for most women.</P>
<P>We systematically reviewed the accuracy of uterine artery Doppler in early pregnancy for predicting pre-eclampsia(6). In clinically high-risk women, a positive Doppler result (abnormal flow velocimetry ratio or the presence diastolic notch) meant a 23.5% (95% CI 18.6 to 29.2) risk of developing pre-eclampsia. With baseline risk elevated to this level and assuming the global estimated relative risk of 0.85 (1), we estimate that 31 (95% CI 18 to 55) patients will be needed to be treated with aspirin to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia. We would thus expect most women with abnormal uterine artery Dopplers, when advised by their clinicians, to request antiplatelet treatment.</P>

</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The main aim of our review was to summarise the evidence. We agree the number needed to treat will be more favourable for women at higher risk, nevertheless, women at moderate/low risk do also seem to benefit. The public health benefit of a 15% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 14% reduction in stillbirth and neonatal death is difficult to quantify, but is likely to be important. Aspirin is the best we have to offer for prevention of pre-eclampsia, with the added advantages of being low cost and reasonable reassurance about safety.</P>
<P>As indicated in our review, we are addressing the issue of potential variations in effect size for women with different baseline risk by<BR/>undertaking a review based on data from individual women.</P>
