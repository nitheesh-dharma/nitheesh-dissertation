<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:32:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants commonly have low levels of sex steroids (estrogen and progesterone) because of lack of placental supply. It is suggested that estrogens and progestins have a role in normal development. However, risks of giving sex hormones include abnormalities in babies such as vaginal cancers and narrowing of the urinary passage. The review authors searched the medical literature and found only one small controlled trial. Thirty female low birthweight preterm infants (less than 29 weeks gestational age and weighing less than 1000 g) were given combined estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone or placebo in the first six weeks of their life. There were no clinical benefits found with giving the sex hormones or any adverse effects during the study. The measured levels of estrogen and progesterone were similar to those found in babies in the womb.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A potential therapeutic effect of sex steroids on premature infants has been proposed from animal data and observational studies in humans. Purported benefits include reduction in chronic lung disease, improved bone density and improved neurodevelopmental outcome. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if estrogens or progestins, either alone or in combination, when compared to placebo or no treatment, reduce morbidity and/or mortality in preterm infants. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2004) was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE 1966 to July 2004 inclusive, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings (Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand 1998-2004 and Pediatric Academic Societies meetings 1998-2004). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of estrogens and/or progestins with placebo or no treatment in preterm infants born less than 30 weeks gestation were included in this review. The primary outcome measures were neonatal mortality and medium-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Other outcomes included length of hospital stay, incidence of chronic lung disease, osteopaenia causing fractures and adverse effects of sex steroid administration.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently selected, assessed the quality of and extracted data from the included studies. Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk and risk difference for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials were identified by the search strategy and one was included in this review, comprising 30 preterm infants. There was no significant effect of replacement of estradiol and progesterone on the outcomes of mortality or neurodevelopmental disability in survivors followed. No adverse effects of sex steroid replacement on short or longer term outcomes were detected.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The one small randomised controlled trial demonstrated neither evidence of benefit or harm related to the replacement of estradiol and progesterone in preterm infants less than 30 weeks gestation. A properly powered randomised controlled trial is required to determine whether or not administration of estradiol or progesterone, either alone or in combination, and at varying doses, confers any clinically significant benefits, or poses any risk, to the preterm infant.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Beneficial roles of sex steroids on the developing infant have been proposed from animal data and observational studies in humans. During pregnancy, the placenta is the primary site of estrogen secretion, utilising precursors that arise from both maternal and fetal compartments (<LINK REF="REF-Siler_x002d_Kohr-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siler-Kohr 1992</LINK>). Levels of unconjugated estrone and estradiol produced by the placenta are at least 100 times the levels found in the non-pregnant adult female (<LINK REF="REF-Kenny-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenny 1973</LINK>) and the fetus is exposed to these high levels of estrogen following transplacental passage (<LINK REF="REF-Hercz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hercz 1985</LINK>) . Following birth, this exposure to high levels of estrogen ceases within 24 hours. At term this state is physiological, ie. the normal development of organ systems progresses in the face of an acute withdrawal of estrogen at term. Placental progesterone synthesis is independent of fetal precursors, and most of the secreted progesterone enters the maternal circulation; however, fetal plasma concentrations are also significantly elevated (<LINK REF="REF-Tulchinsky-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tulchinsky 1994</LINK>). The preterm infant is deprived of this elevated sex steroid exposure through to term, and the biological effects of this deprivation on developing organ systems are unknown. </P>
<P>Observation of preterm infants receiving either breast milk or pre-term formula has revealed that even when supplemented with vitamin D, accumulation of calcium and phosphorous is inefficient by comparison to the fetus in-utero, possibly due to poor gut absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Lyon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyon 1984</LINK>). Given the relative deficiency of sex steroids in the preterm infant, it has been postulated that replacement of these hormones may facilitate mineral accretion (<LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002a</LINK>) . Human osteoblasts express estrogen receptors and estrogens have been shown to stimulate osteoblast proliferation. Estradiol may also prevent glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of osteoblasts (<LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2000</LINK>). In addition to a potential role early in life, estrogen clearly plays a protective role in post-menopausal osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Animal studies have demonstrated that administration of estrogen to pregnant rabbits increases surfactant production by the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 1985</LINK>), and accelerates morphologic maturation of the fetal lung (<LINK REF="REF-Khosla-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khosla 1981</LINK>). Whether or not sex steroid deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of surfactant deficiency in the preterm infant is speculative. </P>
<P>It has also been postulated that the sex steroids have a role to play in the central nervous system. Two possible mechanisms exist for such a role. The first is in the minimisation of brain injury following an ischaemic event - a theory which derives plausibility from the observation of improved outcome in stroke patients who received estrogen replacement following their injury (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 2001</LINK>). The second relates to a potential role of estrogens in the sequence of normal brain development (<LINK REF="REF-Beyer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beyer 1999</LINK>). Specifically, estrogens have been shown to promote synapse formation (<LINK REF="REF-Matsumoto-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsumoto 1991</LINK>) and progesterone has been shown to promote myelination (<LINK REF="REF-Baulieu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baulieu 1996</LINK>). Again, speculation exists about the role of these hormones on neurodevelopment in the human infant. There is evidence from observational studies of girls with Turner syndrome that estrogen therapy can improve verbal and nonverbal memory (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2000</LINK>) and that women with Turner syndrome have altered mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Downey-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downey 1989</LINK>). Estrogen levels modulate the activity of platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase, and platelet activating factor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2001</LINK>). These links, whilst tenuous, raise biologically plausible possibilities about the potential role of sex steroids on various aspects of the preterm infant's wellbeing. </P>
<P>Administration of sex steroids is not without risk. In the 1960's, women with high risk pregnancies were treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES). Epidemiological studies have since demonstrated strong associations between such therapy and abnormalities in the offspring of these pregnancies. Specifically, in the daughters of treated women there is a significantly increased risk of vaginal adenocarcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Herbst-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 1975</LINK>) and of unfavourable outcome of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1980</LINK>). Sons of treated women have also been shown to have abnormalities of the urogenital tract, specifically urethral stricture (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maintenance of plasma levels of estradiol and progesterone similar to those measured in-utero have been achieved following the intravenous administration of these hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Trotter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 1999</LINK>). Postnatal treatment of the preterm infant with estradiol and progesterone resulted in the attainment of measures of uterine width similar to those of the fetus in-utero, compared to untreated infants whose uteri were significantly smaller than either fetuses of the same post menstrual age, or postnatally treated infants (<LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002a</LINK>). Whilst biological activity seems attainable, clinically important effects have yet to be established.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group as outlined in the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2004) was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings (Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand 1998-2004 and Pediatric Academic Societies meetings 1998-2004). </P>
<P>The search of MEDLINE, 1966 to July 2004 inclusive, included MeSH searches using the following terms ("infant, premature" AND [progest$ OR oestr$]) and text searches using the terms "[progest$ and oestr$]". Searches were limited to "clinical trials". No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>This systematic review followed the Cochrane Collaboration methodology according to guidelines of the Neonatal Review Group. Three reviewers independently identified the studies which are included, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted the data. Agreement between reviewers was reached through discussion. Methodological quality assessment was based on 1) blinding of randomisation, 2) blinding of intervention, 3) completeness of follow-up and 4) blinding of outcome measurement. When necessary, additional information and clarification of published data was requested from the authors of individual trials. Meta-analyses were performed using the fixed effects model, and a heterogeneity test (I-squared test) was applied to ensure that pooling of data was valid. Relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) were calculated for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all analyses. The number needed to treat (NNT) and associated 95% CI were determined for a statistically significant reduction in the RD.</P>
<P>When extracting data from the included studies for the secondary outcome chronic lung disease, variations in definition were accepted as a post facto departure from the original protocol.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two relevant studies were identified by the search. </P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK>, included in this review, reported a cohort of infants that were reported in several different publications. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data relating to this study were reported in <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 1999</LINK>. No clinically relevant outcomes were reported in that paper. Various aspects of clinical outcome for this cohort were then reported in <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002b</LINK>. Neurodevelopmental follow-up at 15 months of age was reported in <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>. These reports will be collectively referred to hereafter as <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK>. Female infants with gestational age &lt; 29 weeks and birthweight &lt; 1000grams were eligible for this study. During the study period, there were 40 eligible infants and consent was obtained for 30 infants, with 15 infants enrolled into either a replacement or control group. Infants in the replacement group received 15 ml/kg/day continuous intravenous infusion of estradiol and progesterone lipid 5% mixture, while the control group received an estradiol-progesterone free lipid 5% mixture. The dosage of estradiol and progesterone was tailored for each individual infant based on measurements of hormones in cord blood and subsequent blood samples at day 1, 3, 5, 7 and then weekly until the seventh postnatal week. The investigators' aim was to maintain plasma levels of 2000-6000 pg/ml for estradiol and 300-600 ng/ml for progesterone, corresponding to intrauterine levels at the same gestation. Once intravenous access was no longer required, the replacement group received estradiol and progesterone transepidermally for a total intervention period of six weeks. Refer to Table of Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>There was one other randomised trial of estrogen replacement reported by <LINK REF="STD-Shanklin-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Shanklin 1970</LINK>. This study was conducted between 1964 and 1966. In this study, 'premature' infants, not defined by gestation or birthweight, received an intramuscular injection within one hour of birth of either equine estrogens or lactose in diluent. The vials had been randomised by one of the investigators, their labels removed and then numbered. In a table of results, only 16 of 287 infants included in this study had birthweights less than 1000 grams. On the other hand, 187 of 287 (65%) of included infants had a birthweight over 2001 grams, effectively excluding them from the gestational range of interest in this review. This study was therefore excluded (see Table of Characteristics of Excluded Studies).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<U>Randomisation:</U> Eligible infants in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> were randomly assigned in blocks of four to receive either estradiol and progesterone replacement or placebo (controls). Method of randomisation was unstated in all reports of this study. Sealed envelopes were used.</P>
<P>
<U>Allocation concealment:</U> Allocation to replacement or control group was carried out with the use of sealed envelopes. </P>
<P>
<U>Blinding of intervention:</U> Whilst intravenous access was required, treatment infants received 15ml/kg/day of estradiol and progesterone-lipid 5% mixture whereas control infants received 15ml/kg/day of an estradiol- and progesterone-free lipid 5% mixture. Dosage of estradiol and progesterone was individualised for subjects in the replacement group, and for some infants this involved a change in infusion rate. There was no change in rate of infusion reported for the placebo group, hence potentially unblinding the intervention. <BR/>Once intravenous access was no longer required, replacement group infants received estradiol and progesterone ointment transepidermally. There was no placebo equivalent reported for transepidermal administration of the intervention. Intervention was conducted for six weeks in total. The number of infants in either group requiring intravenous therapy for the first six weeks postnatal life is not reported.</P>
<P>
<U>Blinding of outcome measurement:</U> In the reports of <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002a</LINK> no reference is made to blinding of outcome measurement. In the report of <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2002b</LINK> the investigator assessing vaginal cytology was blind to intervention. There was no blinding of any other short term outcome measurement. Importantly, in the report of <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>, the psychologist and paediatric neurologist performing assessments of long term neurodevelopmental outcome were blind to treatment group.</P>
<P>
<U>Completeness of follow-up:</U> The report of <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK> states that 25 survivors of 30 infants randomised to replacement or placebo were eligible for long-term follow-up. 24 infants were subsequently examined, and Bayley results were reported for 21 infants (21/25 =84%). Three infants (two receiving sex steroid and one control) were excluded from this analysis because sensory impairment invalidated administration of the Bayley scales, or the infant was too tired to perform the tests.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Thirty female infants in total were randomised in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> to receive either combined estradiol and progesterone replacement or placebo for the first six postnatal weeks.</P>
<P>
<U>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:</U>
<BR/>
<U>Neonatal mortality and mortality to hospital discharge:</U> There was no significant difference in either neonatal mortality (RR 2.0, 95%CI 0.2 to 19.78) or mortality to hospital discharge (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.13 to 3.44) between preterm female infants who received estradiol and progesterone and those who received placebo.</P>
<P>
<U>Neurodevelopmental impairment:</U> <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK>report neurodevelopmental outcome at 15 months of age for 24 of the 30 subjects first reported in <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK>. They report a trend to reduction of psychomotor index on Bayleys Developmental assessment for control infants compared to those that received hormone replacement, but only median, minimum and maximum scores are reported. Those infants receiving estradiol and progesterone had median MDI scores (min, max) of 89 (71, 107) compared to controls who had median MDI 93 (49, 111). Steroid supplemented infants had median PDI (min, max) of 101 (49, 121) compared to controls who had median PDI 71 (49, 121). The report of <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 2001</LINK> also suggests that control infants had more neurological impairment than those that received hormone replacement. From the data presented, there were no significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcome between the two groups. There are no data allowing comparison of components of neurological impairment (blindness, hearing impairment and cerebral palsy). </P>
<P>
<U>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:</U>
<BR/>1. Length of stay in newborn intensive care is not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> report a reduction in median length of stay in hospital for those infants who received estradiol and progesterone replacement compared to controls, however further analysis is not possible from the data available.</P>

However, the number of infants who were endotracheally intubated in each group was reported, and there was no significant difference between the groups (RR 0.92, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.36). <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> report that 9 of 13 hormone replaced, and 11 of 14 controls were intubated. We have assumed that those infants who died in the first few days of life (2 in the replacement group and 1 in the control group) were intubated prior to death.</LI>
<LI>Chronic lung disease as defined by supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post menstrual age - Whilst the definition of chronic lung disease used by <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> is not stated, they report no significant difference in chronic lung disease between hormone replacement and control groups (RR 0.12, 95%CI 0.01 to 2.02). They sspecifythat 3 of 13 infants receiving hormone replacement, compared to 7 of 14 control infants were given dexamethasone to prevent chronic lung disease, but the criteria for administration of dexamethasone are not stated. Acceptance of this data without definition is a post-facto departure from the original protocol.</LI>
<LI>Bone mineral accretion (measured by bone densitometry) at any time after term corrected - Bone densitometry was not performed as part of the only included study. However, bone mineral accretion rates, calculated by the measurement of dietary calcium and phosphorus intake and fecal and urinary calcium and phosphate excretion, suggest no difference in bone mineral accretion between hormone replaced and control infants.</LI>
<LI>Severe osteopaenia of prematurity identified by presence of pathological fracture - not reported.</LI>
<LI>Necrotising enterocolitis - There was no significant difference in the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis between those infants who received hormone replacement and controls (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.58).</LI>

<BR/>
</U>No adverse events related to hormone administration are reported in the included study.</P>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses could not be performed. There was only one trial enrolling only female subjects and randomising them to receive both estradiol and progesterone or placebo. Thus effects of gender or of individual hormone replacement could not be addressed. Administration of hormone was initially intravenous and then transdermal once intravascular access was no longer clinically required, to a total of six weeks of hormone treatment. Analysis of differences based on route of aadministrationwas not possible.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review reports the results of 30 preterm female infants, with gestational age less than 29 weeks and birthweight less than 1000 grams, who were randomised to receive either a combination of estradiol and pprogesterone intravenously and transepidermally, or placebo intravenously, for the first six weeks of postnatal life. The dosage of hormone administered was individually tailored to maintain plasma estradiol and progesterone levels similar to those found in-utero at the same post-conceptional age. Despite the potential benefits of sex steroid administration, no clinically significant benefits are detectable from the administration of a combination of estradiol and progesterone, although the number of infants studied to date is small. The study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1999a</LINK> is described as a pilot study justifying the small number of infants randomised. To date there has been no data to suggest that some infants will maintain hormone levels similar to the in-utero status without supplementation, nor have there been any studies examining the effect of individual hormone replacement, different routes of administration or hormone replacement in male preterm infants. The dramatic difference in hormone profiles between the fetus in-utero compared to ex-utero infants of the same post-conceptional age, coupled with the limited findings suggesting benefits of sex steroid replacement, leave this area open to further scientific evaluation.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine replacement of estradiol or progesterone, either alone or in combination, in preterm infants. Furthermore, the data available currently do not adequately address the possibility that the administration of sex steroids to the preterm infant may be detrimental to long term psychological wellbeing. However, the little data available to date suggest no short term adverse effects from the maintenance of estradiol and progesterone levels similar to those experienced in utero. Administration of sex steroids to preterm infants should only take place within properly constructed randomised controlled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A properly powered randomised controlled trial is required to determine whether or not administration of estradiol or progesterone, either alone or in combination, and at varying doses, confers any clinically significant benefits, or poses any risk, to the preterm infant. Such a trial should include neurodevelopmental follow-up to at least two years of age, and would ideally include psychological follow-up into at least adolescence.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Random study: yes, method not stated.<BR/>Allocation concealment: sealed envelopes batched into groups of four. <BR/>Blinding of intervention: Initially, continuous intravenous infusions were commenced at a rate of 15ml/kg/day of either estradiol-progesterone-lipid 5% mixture for the replacement group or lipid 5% mixture alone for the control group. Dosage of estradiol and progesterone varied between subjects in the replacement group, and this was varied for some infants by changing the infusion rate or altering the concentration of hormone in the infusate. No changes in infusion rate were reported for the placebo group - thus potentially unblinding the intervention. Once intravenous access was no longer required, estradiol and progesterone were administered transepidermally with ointment. There is no mention in any of the reports that a transepidermal placebo was applied to control infants. <BR/>Blinding of measurement: variably reported. Neurodevelopmental outcome data were collected by a psychologist and paediatric neurologist blind to treatment group.<BR/>Losses to follow-up: yes, <BR/>Neurodevelopmental follow-up data available for 24/25 survivors.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment: adequate. <BR/>Blinding of intervention: no.<BR/>Blinding of outcome measurement: yes.<BR/>Losses to follow-up: minimal.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Female infants with gestational age &lt; 29 weeks and birthweight &lt; 1000g were eligible. During the study period, consent was obtained for 30 of 40 eligible infants, and 15 infants were randomised to each of replacement and control groups.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention commenced as soon as intravenous access was established on the first day of life. In the replacement group, a continuous infusion of estradiol-progesterone-lipid 5% mixture was commenced at 15 ml/kg/day, and the infusion rate or concentration of hormone in the infusate adjusted to achieve plasma hormone levels of 2000-6000 pg/ml of estradiol and 300-600 ng/ml of progesterone. Dosage adjustment was based on measurement of plasma hormones from cord blood, and then serial measurements on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and then weekly until the seventh postnatal week. Once intravenous access was no longer required, estradiol and progesterone were administered transepidermally with ointment. No transepidermal placebo is reported.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Short term morbidity (intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and chronic lung disease) and mortality. Calcium and phosphorus balance are reported for a subset of the cohort (11 replacement infants and 9 controls). Uterine and mammary growth, and vaginal cytology are reported for the 25 survivors (13 replacement and 12 controls) of the original 30 randomised subjects.
