<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We reviewed the evidence about the beneficial effect of oxygen supplementation therapy as part of the treatment for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). As oxygen may be administered using different delivery methods, we reviewed the most commonly used methods to deliver oxygen in children. As a secondary question, we reviewed the evidence regarding which signs or symptoms could indicate the need for oxygen therapy in children presenting with acute LRTI.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Acute LRTI is the most frequent cause for hospitalisation out of all respiratory infections and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children aged under five in low-income countries. Oxygen therapy plays an important part in treating severe LRTIs but we need to determine its effectiveness at preventing children from developing more severe disease. Oxygen can be delivered by non-invasive methods (nasal prongs, nasal cannula, nasopharyngeal catheter, face mask and head box) and we wanted to discover how effective these methods are as they have not been adequately evaluated.</P>
<P>
<B>Studies characteristics</B>
<BR/>For our primary question we included experimental studies assessing the use of oxygen versus no oxygen and studies comparing oxygen delivery systems in children aged from one to five years with acute LRTI. We identified one pilot study (58 children) assessing oxygen therapy in children with pneumonia and four studies (479 participants) assessing the effectiveness of different non-invasive oxygen delivery systems.</P>
<P>For our secondary question, we included 14 observational studies conducted to determine the clinical indicators of hypoxaemia in children with acute LRTIs.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>It appears that oxygen therapy given early in the course of pneumonia via nasal prongs at a flow rate of 1 to 2 L/min does not prevent children with severe pneumonia from developing hypoxaemia. However, the applicability of this evidence is limited as it comes from a small pilot trial. Clinicians caring for children must make their decision to use supplemental oxygen on an individual basis.</P>
<P>Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter are similar in effectiveness when used for children with acute LRTI. Nasal prongs are associated with less nasal obstruction. The use of a face mask and head box has been poorly studied and appears not to be superior to nasopharyngeal catheter in terms of effectiveness or safety when used in children with acute LRTI.</P>
<P>There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia in children with acute LRTI. However, the summary of results presented here can help clinicians to identify children with more severe conditions.</P>
<P>Studies assessing the effectiveness of oxygen therapy in children with different baseline risks are needed, as well as studies that aim to identify the most effective and safe oxygen delivery method.</P>
<P>Our evidence is current to October 2014.</P>

<P>For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS from March 2008 to October 2014.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-15 10:15:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs comparing oxygen versus no oxygen therapy or different methods of oxygen delivery in children with LRTI aged from three months to 15 years. To determine the indications for oxygen therapy, we included observational studies or diagnostic test accuracy studies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors independently scanned the search results to identify studies for inclusion. Two authors independently performed the methodological assessment and the third author resolved any disagreements. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and adverse events (AEs). We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarised the results reported in the included observational studies for the clinical indicators of hypoxaemia.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:47:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review update, we included four studies (479 participants) assessing the efficacy of non-invasive delivery methods for the treatment of LRTI in children and 14 observational studies assessing the clinical sign indicators of hypoxaemia in children with LRTIs.</P>
<P>Three RCTs (399 participants) compared the effectiveness of nasal prongs or nasal cannula with nasopharyngeal catheter; one non-RCT (80 participants) compared head box, face mask, nasopharyngeal catheter and nasal cannula. The nasopharyngeal catheter was the control group. Treatment failure was defined as number of children failing to achieve adequate arterial oxygen saturation. All included studies had a high risk of bias because of allocation methods and lack of blinded outcome assessment.</P>
<P>For nasal prongs versus nasopharyngeal catheter, the pooled effect estimate for RCTs showed a worrying trend towards no difference between the groups (two RCTs; 239 participants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.38). Similar results were shown in the one non-RCT (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.27). The overall quality of this evidence is very low. Nasal obstruction due to severe mucus production was different between treatment groups (three RCTs, 338 participants; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 0%). The quality of this evidence is low.</P>
<P>The use of a face mask showed a statistically significant lower risk of failure to achieve arterial oxygen &gt; 60 mmHg than the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non-RCT; 80 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88).</P>
<P>The use of a head box showed a non-statistically significant trend towards a reduced risk of treatment failure compared to the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non-RCT; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.12). The quality of this evidence is very low.</P>
<P>To determine the presence of hypoxaemia in children presenting with LRTI, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of nine clinical signs reported by the included observational studies and used this information to calculate likelihood ratios. The results showed that there is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Benguigui-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benguigui 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is estimated that 4.3 million children under the age of five die each year from acute LRTIs. Pneumonia in particular has been named by the Word Heath Organization (WHO) as "the world's biggest killer of children" (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_PAHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/PAHO 2006</LINK>), and accounts for nearly one-fifth of childhood deaths worldwide, with approximately two million children under the age of five dying each year. The majority of deaths occur in Africa and South-East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>). In Latin America the mortality rate varies widely in children under five years of age: from 5 per 1000 live births in Cuba to 49 per 1000 in Haiti (<LINK REF="REF-CEPAL_x002f_UNICEF-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEPAL/UNICEF 2011</LINK>), and acute LRTI accounts for 20% to 25% of the total deaths in countries with higher mortality rates in this age group. Longitudinal studies conducted by the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) have shown that in Central American countries, preschool children suffer about seven episodes of respiratory tract infection (RTI) per year with a median duration of 11 days and 5% of these are serious LRTI. Acute LRTIs, particularly pneumonia and bronchiolitis, are the most frequent cause for hospitalisation in children less than five years of age.</P>
<P>In low-income countries supplementary oxygen is limited, as well as in rural areas of middle-income countries, where few healthcare centres are able to provide it. Children presenting with LRTI are frequently referred to a hospital, far away from their home, in order to have access to this resource. These situations are often difficult for families for several reasons: lack of economic resources, armed conflict or forced displacement, among others, which mean parents are unable to accept referrals, leaving children without complete treatment and therefore increasing their risk of complications and death as result of the delay in receiving adequate attention.</P>
<P>Since 1993, multiple clinical practice guidelines and protocols have recommended oxygen therapy as an important treatment component for severe acute LRTI (<LINK REF="REF-Arango-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arango 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF_x002f_PAHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF/PAHO 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). Since 2000, the WHO has made recommendations regarding acute LRTIs in children under five years of age, which have been included in the WHO/UNICEF Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) programme (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). In this simple strategy, healthcare providers are advised to treat children with a cough and normal respiratory rate (cough or cold) without antibiotics and without hospitalisation. They recommend that children who have fast breathing and no chest indrawing should be classified as having pneumonia and should receive antibiotics as outpatients. The WHO classifies children with pneumonia and chest indrawing as having severe pneumonia and this requires hospitalisation and treatment with appropriate antibiotics.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oxygen supplementation is most important in the presence of hypoxaemia and its value changes depending on the altitude (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reuland 1991</LINK>). There are no specific guidelines on the method of oxygen delivery for acute LRTIs. A number of studies and guidelines have described different flow rates according to the age and weight of patients and the concentrations depend on the methods used (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muhe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). There are several non-invasive methods for uncomplicated LRTIs, including the following.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Face mask: a plastic mask connected to an oxygen source, fitted over the patient's nose and mouth with side-to-side perforations that allow room air entrance when placed over the infant's face. Usually high flow rates are needed to avoid the risk of carbon dioxide accumulation. With this method oxygen concentration delivery varies depending on the infant's respiratory flow rate and the oxygen flow into the system (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>). It interferes with feeding because it must be removed. Many infants refuse to keep the mask on.</LI>
<LI>Head box or hood: a plastic box or tent placed surrounding the infant's head (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>). It needs high flow rates (more than 5 L/min) to avoid re-breathing carbon dioxide (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>). It is the only method that allows fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) to be measured precisely. The infant's mobility and feeding are limited. There is no increased risk of gastric distension or airway obstruction.</LI>
<LI>Nasopharyngeal catheter: soft tubes with several distal holes inserted into the nose to a depth equal to the distance from the side of the nostril to the front of the ear (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>). It is used at low flow rates. Humidifiers are needed to avoid pharyngeal secretions drying. It can be blocked with mucus that can cause airway obstruction. There is risk of gastric distension if the catheter is displaced. According to the WHO an 8F nasopharyngeal catheter is recommended.</LI>
<LI>Nasal catheter: a thin, flexible tube passed through the nose and ending with its tip in the nasal cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>), to a depth equal to the distance from the side of the nostril to the inner margin of the eyebrow. It has the same disadvantages as the nasopharyngeal catheter.</LI>
<LI>Nasal prongs or nasal cannula: consists of two soft prongs that are designed to lie just within the nostrils which arise from oxygen supply tubing. The FiO<SUB>2</SUB> varies with the patient's inspiratory flow, the cannula gas flow, the relationship between the prong and nasal diameter and the patient's body weight. This means that it is not easy to determine the FiO<SUB>2</SUB> reaching the patient's airway. It can be blocked with secretions, but there is no risk of gastric distension (<LINK REF="REF-Frey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>).</LI>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the must important signs associated with severe LRTI is hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia is defined as a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Theodore-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theodore 2013</LINK>). Hypoxaemia does not necessarily indicate tissue hypoxia. It can be caused by hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunt, diffusion impairment, or reduced inspired oxygen tension (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2005</LINK>). In LRTI, inflammation causing alveolar congestion, respiratory tract secretions, fatigue of respiratory muscles and reduced central system response to hypoxia, act synergically contributing to hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion mismatch and reduced inspired oxygen tension; all of which contribute to hypoxaemia.</P>
<P>Hypoxaemia in children with LRTI has been associated with increased risk of mortality and long-term morbility (<LINK REF="REF-West-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1999</LINK>). Therefore, supplemental oxygen therapy may improve outcomes of hypoxaemic children presenting with LRTI.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children under five years of age may also be affected by bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia (with no active bacterial infection). In certain clinical contexts, clinicians may be able to establish these diagnoses and withholding antibiotic therapy may be appropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Lozano-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 1994</LINK>). In the case of bronchiolitis, the only universally accepted treatment is oxygen therapy when needed. In some places oxygen administration in children with respiratory infections is a routine procedure and we propose to find out its efficacy, risk and impact.</P>
<P>In addition, little is known from experimental data about the effects of supplemental oxygen and the impact of the different non-invasive methods of oxygen administration in children with acute LRTIs. Oxygen is recommended for children with severe pneumonia plus cyanosis or an inability to feed ('very severe disease' or 'very severe pneumonia'). In the latest WHO publication <I>Recommendations of management common childhood conditions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>), oxygen therapy continues to be recommended for LRTI, based mainly on the evidence presented in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2009</LINK>), without any further evidence of its effectiveness. The WHO generally recommends the use of nasopharyngeal catheters and nasal cannula (nasal prongs) as safe and efficient methods of oxygen delivery (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). Whether or not this is a more effective way of preventing children from developing a more severe condition or subsequent hypoxaemia remains unknown. It is possible that more severely ill patients will benefit from other more invasive oxygen delivery methods such as continuous positive air pressure (CPAP).</P>
<P>This review assesses the effect of oxygen therapy as well as the effectiveness of non-invasive oxygen delivery systems on children's recovery in terms of oxygen saturation, improvement in signs of respiratory distress, length of hospital stay, mortality rates and ventilation requirements.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-07 07:49:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>The three review authors independently performed a methodological assessment of the studies that met the eligibility criteria using the Users' Guides to the Medical Literature (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2002</LINK>). For this 2014 review update we reassessed the following methodological aspects of the included RCTs using the 'Risk of bias' tool in RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We evaluated the risk of bias in non-randomised studies assessing interventions in a similar way to randomised trials, but we paid more attention to the possibility of selection and classification bias. The aspects were as follows.</P>
<P>which describes each of these domains as reported in the trial and then assigning a judgement about the adequacy of each entry: low, high risk of bias or unclear (or unknown) risk of bias.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or unclear risk. </LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or unclear risk. </LI>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as: low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; adequate, inadequate or unclear risk for outcome assessors. </LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as: low risk (&lt; 20% missing data); high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data) or unclear risk. </LI>
<LI>Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear risk. </LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: low risk; high risk or unclear risk.  </LI>
<OL>
<LI>The quality assessment of diagnostic studies evaluating the clinical signs associated with hypoxaemia considered the independency and blinding of the evaluation of diagnostic tests and their results (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2002</LINK>). Results of this assessment are summarised in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Finally, we assessed the overall quality and certainty of the evidence resulting from the comparison of oxygen delivery methods for each main outcome, following the GRADE framework (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). We used the non-randomised study as a complement to RCTs for the outcome 'treatment failure'. To do this we focused on judgements in the context of the domains that influence the overall quality of the body of evidence, such as limitations in the detailed study design and execution, inconsistency, imprecision and factors that may decrease our confidence in effects (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We analysed each study individually to determine the risk ratio/odds ratio (RR/OR) for the pre-determined outcomes such as failure to achieve adequate oxygenation (treatment failure), nose ulceration or bleeding, nasal obstruction, discomfort in the first 24 hours and death during treatment.</P>
<P>We used standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes such as litres per minute (L/min) of oxygen required in the first 24 hours to achieve adequate oxygen saturation measured by oximeter (SpO<SUB>2</SUB>).</P>
<P>We obtained an overall effect for the main outcomes reported by RCTs using the fixed-effect model. Quantitative analysis of outcomes (RCTs) was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. As both RCTs and non-RCTs were included to assess the effects of interventions, we presented results separately by study design.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome 'Clinical criteria that would indicate the need for oxygen therapy or hypoxaemia in children' the treatment effect measure was the sensitivity and specificity of each sign or symptom in predicting hypoxaemia.

<P>The initial search conducted in March 2008 retrieved a total of 559 references. For this 2014 update of the review, we ran searches from 1 March 2008 to 8 October 2014. These new searches yielded 831 references in MEDLINE; 117 in EMBASE; 28 in CENTRAL and 34 in LILACS, after de-duplication. Adding the 'anoxia' term yielded 18 additional references in MEDLINE and in EMBASE.</P>
<P>In total (from old and new searches), we identified 77 studies as potentially eligible. References from the studies yielded an additional 35 potentially eligible studies and we identified four studies from manual searching. From these, we initially selected 30 studies: eight studies compared oxygen therapy or oxygen delivery methods and 24 observational studies addressed different questions related to our secondary objectives. One study assessed the presence of clinical deterioration or signs of a more severe illness or needing invasive respiratory support; 20 studies assessed clinical signs predictors of hypoxaemia, two studies reported side effects and one study evaluated the costs of oxygen therapies. We rejected the remaining 45 studies for the following reasons: narrative reviews, non-randomised studies, included neonates or preterms, included patients with other pathologies, compared treatment strategies other than oxygen therapy or oxygen delivery methods, compared CPAP with high flow nasal prongs, were editorials or letters, practice guidelines or had adult populations. We did not find any studies including children older than five years of age.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2012</LINK> is a report of a pilot RCT conducted in Chandigarh, India with the aim of studying the incidence of subsequent hypoxaemia in initially normoxaemic children with pneumonia and lower chest indrawing. They included patients aged two to 59 months with severe pneumonia and without hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&gt; 90%). Patients with a known chronic systemic illness, major malformations, congenital heart disease, pneumonia secondary to aspiration/chemicals or suspected tuberculosis were excluded. Children (n = 58, three to 59 months) with pneumonia, lower chest indrawing and normoxaemia were randomly assigned to receive supplemental oxygen (nasal prongs, 1 to 2 L/min flow) (n = 29) or room air (n = 29). Vital signs and SpO<SUB>2</SUB> were monitored continuously and recorded every six hours. All patients were treated with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin followed by oral antimicrobial therapy once they were clinically stable. Outcome variables were incidence of hypoxaemia, length of tachypnoea and lower chest indrawing. Patients who developed hypoxaemia later were similar to those who did not, except for a lower SpO<SUB>2</SUB> at enrolment</P>

A total of 121 children between two weeks and five years of age with hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%) due to acute LRTI were randomised to receive oxygen by nasopharyngeal catheters (n = 61) or nasal prongs (n = 60). Randomisation was grouped by age into three groups: two to seven weeks, eight weeks to 11 months, and 12 months to five years. Authors measured daily SaO<SUB>2</SUB> and complications (catheter blockage, nasal ulceration, nasal blockage due to drying of secretions around the catheters, abdominal distension and aspiration of gastric contents). Patients who failed to achieve adequate oxygenation with the assigned treatment were classified as primary treatment failures and the alternative treatment was then tried.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1998</LINK> RCT was performed in Addis Ababa (2800 MASL) with the aim of comparing the safety and effectiveness of nasal prongs compared to a modified version of the nasopharyngeal catheter (an 8 FG catheter was passed through the nose up to the same distance measured from the side of the nostril to the inner margin of the eyebrow). The study included children between two weeks and five years of age with acute LRTI associated with hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%). Children were randomly assigned to receive oxygen by nasal catheter (n = 49) or nasal prongs (n = 50).

<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Reuland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reuland 1991</LINK> was conducted in Junin, the Peruvian Andes (3750 MASL) to determine the effect of respiratory infections on oxygen saturation. The prospective study included 423 children between 2 and 60 months with acute respiratory infections. Children with chronic illnesses such as asthma, congenital cardiac malformation or heart murmurs were excluded. Clinical signs and symptoms present at the time of admission were recorded by an expert physician who was blinded to the oximeter reading. SpO<SUB>2</SUB> was also measured at this time. Using two clinical categories, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and LRTI and balancing by age group, they determined the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LR) for several potential indicators of hypoxaemia. The SpO<SUB>2</SUB> cut-off was determined by studying 153 healthy children from the same population. Hypoxaemia was considered to be present if SpO<SUB>2</SUB> was &gt; 2 standard deviations below the mean value for healthy children (2 to 11 months: SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 84 and 12 to 60 months: SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 86).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Onyango-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Onyango 1993</LINK> conducted a study in the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya (1676 MASL) in order to predict hypoxaemia based on clinical signs and symptoms present at the time of admission to the hospital. They included 256 children aged from 7 days to 36 months with LRTI. Children presenting with moderate or severe dehydration, with anaemia, central nervous system, cardiac, renal or metabolic diseases were excluded. Recorded data included respiratory rates, pulse, central cyanosis, chest retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, wheezing, crepitations or rhonchi on auscultation. SpO<SUB>2</SUB> breathing room air and a chest radiograph read by a blinded physician were taken as the gold standard for diagnosis of hypoxaemia associated with LRTI. To define the SpO<SUB>2</SUB> cut-off point, oxygen saturation was measured with an oximeter in 87 healthy children attending the child welfare clinics (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> = mean 95.7 standard deviation (SD) 1.6%). Each clinical finding was assessed for its sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of hypoxaemia. Results are presented in three age strata.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lozano-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 1994</LINK> study was conducted in Bogota, Colombia (2640 MASL). It assessed the usefulness of clinical signs and symptoms in the diagnosis of radiological pneumonia or hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 88%), or both. They included 201 children aged from seven days to 36 months, presenting with cough lasting up to seven days and whose evaluation included a chest radiograph. Children were excluded if they had cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological or congenital defects; a chronic disease including asthma, cancer, immunosuppression and metabolic disorders; or previous episodes of wheezing. Data on symptoms and clinical signs of acute respiratory infection were obtained using a standardised questionnaire and a physical examination performed by a paediatrician. The gold standard used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for each symptom was a chest radiograph read by a blinded physician plus the oxygen saturation measured by oximeter.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Dyke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dyke 1995</LINK> was undertaken in Tari, New Guinea (1600 MASL), with the aim of identifying the indications for administering oxygen based on easily recognisable signs. This study included 91 children between three months and five years with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Clinical signs present at the initial evaluation (cyanosis, poor feeding, crepitations, bronchial breathing, grunting, chest indrawing, nasal flaring, drowsiness and hepatomegaly) were recorded. To establish the 'adequate' values of oxygen saturation, 100 healthy children from Tari were assessed with oximeter and hypoxaemia was defined as SpO<SUB>2</SUB> equal to or less than 85%. Sensitivity and specificity of each sign were calculated, to indicate whether hypoxaemia was present, taking the oximeter readings as the gold standard. Authors also developed regression equations to predict hypoxaemia.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Weber-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1997</LINK> was a case-control study conducted in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Banjul, Gambia at sea level, with the aim of studying the signs and symptoms indicating hypoxaemia in children with pneumonia. It included 69 children with LRTI and hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%) classified as cases and 111 children with the same selection criteria but without hypoxaemia classified as controls (enrolled in two different hospitals: 67 control form the Royal Victoria and 44 from the Medical Research Council, Fajara). Cases and controls were matched by age. Clinical findings were recorded at the time of admission from physical examination and anthropometric measurements. Chest radiographic findings were evaluated by a blinded physician. Using multi-regression analysis, they derived models to determine the clinical predictors of hypoxaemia. The sensitivity and specificity of each single model was calculated.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Smyth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 1998</LINK> was performed in Katete, Zambia (1150 MASL). The study included 158 rural children between four weeks and five years with severe or very severe pneumonia according to the WHO classification. Their purpose was to investigate the clinical signs (respiratory rate, chest indrawing, grunting, crepitations/bronchial breathing, cyanosis, failure to drink) that predict hypoxaemia. In a pilot study with 85 healthy infants they established a cut-off point of normal oxygen saturation at Zambia altitude (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&gt; 92%). Data were used to develop a multiple regression equation to predict hypoxaemia stratified by age group. Individual data for the sensitivity and specificity of respiratory rate to confirm the presence of hypoxaemia were reported for nine different cut-off points (increments of four breaths/min). The SpO<SUB>2</SUB> measure was taken as the gold standard. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to predict hypoxaemia.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Usen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Usen 1999</LINK> study was undertaken in two hospitals in Banjul, Gambia at sea level. The authors analysed data collected as part of the 'haemophilus influenza vaccine for the prevention of infant pneumonia' trial, to study the clinical signs that could predict hypoxaemia. The study included 1072 children aged between 2 and 33 months in the trial cohort who were admitted with pneumonia or any other form of acute LRTI. Any child who had signs of structural heart disease, Down's syndrome or those who had been included in a previous case-control study of hypoxaemia were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of symptoms and clinical signs reported by the patients' mothers, as well as multi-regression models, were used to confirm the presence of hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 90%). The oximeter readings were taken as the gold standard.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2001</LINK> study was conducted in Montevideo, Uruguay (43 MASL). A total of 216 hospitalised children between one month and five years with LRTI or with asthma were evaluated to determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of tachypnoea, tachycardia and chest retractions to determine the presence of hypoxaemia associated with LRTI. Children with chronic respiratory distress and neuromuscular diseases were excluded from the study. Hypoxaemia was defined as SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 95%. Oxygen saturation measured by oximeter was taken as the gold standard. Results are presented in group of signs or symptoms.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK> was conducted in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea (1600 MASL). Two hundred and fifty-seven neonates and children (59%) were enrolled in the study with the aim of determining the incidence and severity of hypoxaemia in neonates and children with acute respiratory and non-respiratory illnesses. To establish normal values of oxygen saturation among well neonates and children they studied 67 neonates and 151 children from 1 to 60 months. Clinical symptoms or signs such as inability to feed, reduced activity, cyanosis, fast respiratory rate, failure to resist examination, grunting and head nodding were assessed as indicators of hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 86%). Presence of hypoxaemia was determined using the oximeter readings as the gold standard. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best independent combination of clinical signs predicting hypoxaemia. Results are presented as odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each predictive model.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lodha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lodha 2004</LINK> study was conducted in the Indian Institutes of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (239 MASL). One hundred and nine children less than five years of age were evaluated in a cross-sectional study, with the aim of determining the prevalence of hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%) in children with acute LRTI and identifying the clinical signs associated with the presence of hypoxaemia in children with LRTI. Children with a history of cough and rapid respiration or difficulty in breathing were included. Children with asthma, congenital heart disease, severe anaemia, peripheral circulatory failure, needing ventilatory support and severe dehydration were excluded. Data were obtained from the mother's report about the presence and duration of various respiratory symptoms, and by physical examination of the child to establish the presence of signs such as: appearance, weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cyanosis, chest retraction, grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding, pallor, crepitation or rhonchi and the state of consciousness. Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated for each symptom or sign and for various combinations of clinical signs as well. The oximeter readings were taken as the gold standard.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Laman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Laman 2005</LINK> study was done in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (at sea level).

Children with underlying pathology such as congenital heart disease, asthma, HIV infection and severe malnourishment (&lt; 60% standard weight for age) were excluded. History and clinical signs were taken at the time of admission. Clinical findings were correlated with different levels of hypoxaemia (&lt; 93%, &lt; 90% and &lt; 85%). Sensitivity, specificity and predicted values of clinical signs were calculated for each level of hypoxaemia established in advanced, using the oximeter readings as the gold standard.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Basnet-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Basnet 2006</LINK> was conducted from December 1999 to July 2000 in the Kathmandu valley (1336 MASL). Trial authors assessed the prevalence of hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%) in 264 children, aged from two months to five years, with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Children with heart disease or any other disease were excluded. Data about relevant history of the illness and examination were collected following a structured questionnaire prepared in advanced, before the child received any treatment. Based on the clinical findings the patients were categorised into four groups according to the severity of illness described in the WHO guidelines. They determined the frequency and the increase of hypoxaemia according to the severity of the illness. Sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs were calculated, taking the oximeter readings as the gold standard.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kuti-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kuti 2013</LINK> was conducted in Gambia at sea level, with the aim of determining factors that predict hypoxaemia at presentation in children with severe pneumonia. They included 420 patients aged from 2 to 59 months with severe pneumonia, 81 of them had hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation &lt; 90%). Children aged 2 to 11 months, with grunting respiration, cyanosis and head nodding and those with cardiomegaly on chest radiograph were at higher risk of hypoxaemia. Patients with wheeze and cough lasting more than two weeks were excluded. All patients enrolled had a chest radiograph at admission and were examined to obtain weight, height to derive nutritional state parameters, axillary temperature, respiratory rate, nasal flaring, presence of pallor, central cyanosis, head nodding, altered sensorium at presentation and abnormal breath sounds on auscultation as well as abnormal heart sounds were recorded. Oxygen saturation was measured using a pulse oximeter and recorded after stabilisation of the reading by a trained nurse. All children were placed on intravenous antibiotics for pneumonia. Grunting respiration and cyanosis were independent predictors of hypoxaemia in childhood pneumonia. They concluded that children that grunt and are centrally cyanosed should be preferentially commenced on oxygen therapy even when there is no facility to confirm hypoxaemia.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Orimadegun-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Orimadegun 2013</LINK> study was conducted in south western Nigeria, at sea level. The authors investigated the prevalence and predictors of hypoxaemia in ALRI and non-ALRI according to age and primary diagnoses. The study included 1726 children admitted to a tertiary hospital from which 313 were diagnosed with ALRI. Oxygen saturation was measured shortly after admission. Hypoxaemia was defined as 90% oxygen saturation. Clinical features and the primary admission diagnoses were recorded. Prevalence of hypoxaemia according to age and diagnoses was calculated. Signs and symptoms associated with hypoxaemia were compared between children with ALRI and those with non-ALRI. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between clinical signs and hypoxaemia adjusting for age.</P>

<P>Results from the assessment of the overall quality and certainty of the evidence resulting from the comparison between 'oxygen delivery methods' for each main outcome are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and discussed in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> section. We are not presenting the assessment of the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes under the comparison 'oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy' as the evidence comes just from one pilot study including 58 participants, and the quality of this evidence is easily anticipated as being very low because of limitations in trial design, the small number of events/participants (inconsistency) and imprecision of estimates (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

In all of these studies, the investigators performed a physical evaluation to determine the presence of each clinical sign at the time of admission and took measurements of the oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter while children were breathing room air. In all cases, physicians caring for patients were blinded to the SpO<SUB>2</SUB> results. The oximeter readings were used as the gold standard in all studies and SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>was measured in every child included in the studies. The definition of hypoxaemia was established in advance depending on the expected SaO<SUB>2</SUB> for the altitude of the city where the study was conducted (between 92% to 96%).</P>

<P>As already stated, we found just one study assessing the effectiveness of oxygen therapy in the treatment of severe LRTI in children (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2012</LINK>). The primary outcome measure was incidence of subsequent hypoxaemia. A total of 31 patients (53.5%) developed hypoxaemia within 60 hours of enrolment; 66% were in the supplemental oxygen group and 42% were in the room air group. The results showed a trend towards an increased risk of developing hypoxaemia in the group receiving oxygen supplementation compared to the room air group. This estimate was not statistically significant (one study; 58 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.63) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Clinical criteria that would indicate the need for oxygen therapy or hypoxaemia in children with LRTI</HEADING>
<P>To describe the oxygen saturation values or clinical signs that would indicate the use of oxygen therapy, we included 13 studies conducted with the aim of assessing the accuracy of each sign and symptom present at the time of admission to indicate the presence of hypoxaemia. The included studies showed important sources of clinical heterogeneity, such as population baseline characteristics (type and severity of underlying diseases, age groups etc). Due to this heterogeneity we did not perform a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Since most of the included studies assessed similar signs and symptoms as predictors of hypoxaemia, we presented the findings in tables grouped by each sign reported within a consistent definition among studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). As already stated, the definition of hypoxaemia used was different in the included studies and was established, in the majority of cases, by evaluating healthy children from a similar population. Differences in altitude and the definition of hypoxaemia used are also presented in these tables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Sensitivity and specificity of signs and symptoms detecting hypoxaemia</HEADING>
<P>The clinical signs more commonly reported were cyanosis, tachypnoea, nasal flaring, grunting, chest indrawing, crepitations, difficulty in feeding and alteration in mental status. The sensitivity and specificity of these signs varied between studies and age groups. Cyanosis, grunting, difficulty in feeding and alteration of mental status were shown to have better specificity in predicting hypoxaemia and the results were consistent among studies. However, the sensitivity of these signs was variable, especially for the presence of cyanosis, and was not related to the age group or the altitude.</P>
<P>The presence of crepitations at the time of admission was shown to have good sensitivity (min 50, max 93) for determining the presence of hypoxaemia in all age groups, but this sign was not specific in most of the studies (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tachypnoea was shown to have better sensitivity in the prediction of hypoxaemia in children from 2 to 11 months, especially when the cut-off point used to define tachypnoea was 50 breaths/minute (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). The specificity of this sign is quite different between age groups (2 to 11 months; older than 12 months) and depends on the cut-off point chosen. This means that tachypnoea alone is not a useful indicator for oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>Study results also showed that the sensitivity and specificity of indrawing are widely variable in all age groups reported (sensitivity: min 32, max 98; specificity: min 7, max 94) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). For this reason, the use of this sign as the only indicator for oxygen therapy, as the WHO recommends, could lead clinicians to an inappropriate use of this limited resource.</P>
<P>The presence of nasal flaring was the only sign reported that showed consistent characteristics as an indicator for the presence of hypoxaemia in all included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). It was studied in populations of children aged between seven days and five years and was shown to have overall good sensitivity (min 48, max 98) and specificity (min 54, max 98), except in one study conducted in infants from 2 months to 36 months where its specificity was 17.</P>

<P>One study assessed the effectiveness of oxygen therapy in the treatment of severe LRTI in children by studying children with signs and symptoms of severe disease but who were normoxaemic at time of admission (<LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2012</LINK>). There was no difference in the risk of developing subsequent hypoxaemia between the treatment groups. This study also showed that lower chest indrawing, tachypnoea and fever were similar in both groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of the non-invasive delivery methods in the treatment of severe acute LRTIs in children</HEADING>
<P>Three of the included studies assessed the effectiveness of nasal prongs in comparison with nasopharyngeal catheter by recording the failure to achieve adequate SpO<SUB>2</SUB> in the hours following oxygen administration (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1995</LINK>). There was no difference in the risk of treatment failure between the groups. There was also no difference in the frequency of oxygen desaturation episodes between the groups when comparing nasal prongs versus nasal catheter (a shorter version of nasopharyngeal catheter) (<LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1998</LINK>). Regarding the side effects associated with each method, the only adverse effect that showed a significant difference between the groups was nasal obstruction due to severe mucus production, which was more frequent in the nasopharyngeal catheter group. Pneumocephalus was the only severe adverse event associated with the nasopharyngeal catheter that was reported. With respect to the mean flow rates required to achieve adequate SaO<SUB>2</SUB>, the results were similar in both groups (nasopharyngeal catheter/nasal catheter and nasal prongs) and we found no significant differences.</P>
<P>Findings from the <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1997</LINK> study showed that the high flow rates used in head boxes and face masks are much more effective in achieving adequate oxygen saturation than the low flow rates used in nasopharyngeal catheters. However, the differences in the amount of oxygen required by these methods are significant (4 L/min versus 1 L/min respectively) and this could increase the treatment cost per day. Oxygen supply in many hospital settings in low-income countries is limited and the use of high-flow systems could increase this problem.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indications for oxygen therapy in children with LRTIs</HEADING>
<P>Several studies have been carried out to try to identify clinical predictors of hypoxaemia in children with LRTI. This research interest responds to the need of physicians and health workers from low-income and middle-income countries, where health resources and supplies are limited, to determine the presence of hypoxaemia in infants and children without using an oximeter or arterial blood gases. However, all these efforts have shown that there is no single sign or symptom that clearly indicates the presence of hypoxaemia. This review confirms the previous findings of 12 authors who used similar clinical sign and hypoxaemia measurement methods (all used an oximeter) in showing the wide variability in the sensitivity and specificity of each sign or symptom. This wide variability could be due to differences in the definitions of hypoxaemia used among studies conducted at similar altitudes; for example <LINK REF="STD-Onyango-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Onyango 1993</LINK>, conducted at 1670 MASL, defined hypoxaemia as SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 91%; <LINK REF="STD-Dyke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dyke 1995</LINK>, conducted at a similar altitude (1600 MASL), defined hypoxaemia as SaO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 86%; and <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>, conducted at the same altitude as <LINK REF="STD-Dyke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dyke 1995</LINK>, defined hypoxaemia as SaO<SUB>2 </SUB>&lt; 88%. Another important issue that can explain this variability is the implication of setting a cut-off value for respiratory rates that indicates tachypnoea at any particular level according to children's age. As <LINK REF="STD-Smyth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lozano-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 1994</LINK> showed, the sensitivity and specificity of this sign would change depending on the cut-off point established for respiratory rate. This means that the use of 'tachypnoea' as an indicator for oxygen therapy would result in a proportion of children being treated with oxygen unnecessarily, and another proportion who would not receive oxygen when they actually need it.</P>
<P>Even with these sources of variability, some authors have made different efforts to improve the predictive value of hypoxaemia in children with LRTI by deriving clinical predictor rules or prediction models based on the combination of clinical signs and symptoms present at the time of admission. These models are not comparable across studies and their reliability in predicting hypoxaemia is still unclear.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK> guidelines for oxygen therapy in children with acute respiratory infections recommend oxygen therapy for infants and children presenting with cyanosis or an inability to drink, as priority cases. According to the evidence presented in this review, cyanosis is indeed one of the more specific signs in determining the presence of hypoxaemia but inability to feed/drink has been shown to be very unspecific and not sensitive amongst the studies that evaluated it. <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK> also recommends giving oxygen to children presenting with severe chest indrawing, or with a respiratory rate greater than or equal to 70 breaths/minute, or to young infants who grunt when breathing. In this review, these three signs, when considered individually, have all shown to be very unspecific in determining the presence of hypoxaemia. Sensitivity and specificity of chest indrawing is widely variable in all age groups reported (sensitivity: min 32, max 98; specificity: min 7, max 94); respiratory rate, as stated above, is not a useful predictor of hypoxaemia since there are no accurate cut-off points established by age groups; and grunting is specific but not sensitive in determining the presence of hypoxaemia.</P>
<P>Some of the included studies assessed the precision of regression models that included all criteria recommended by <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK> (inability to feed, cyanosis, respiratory rates &gt; 70 breaths/minute or severe chest indrawing) in predicting hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gutierrez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gutierrez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smyth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Usen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Usen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1997</LINK>). In general, this model showed high sensitivity among studies (62%, 76%, 80.9% and 27% respectively) in determining the presence of hypoxaemia, but low specificity (this finding was expected since the addition of signs improves sensitivity and decreases specificity). Given this, following the algorithm recommended by <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK> will result in giving oxygen to patients who do not have hypoxaemia. <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>, for example, found that by using this highly sensitive model, almost 50% of children studied would be given oxygen without requiring it. According to these results, using the WHO criteria for giving oxygen can lead to an inappropriate use of medical oxygen, which is a very limited resource in most health facilities in low-income countries. By following these criteria we are also increasing the medical treatment costs of acute respiratory infections in infants and children.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important to highlight the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or well-designed cohort studies assessing the effects of oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in children with LRTI. Evidence on the effect of the oxygen therapy comes from a small pilot study (58 children enrolled) that suggests there are no advantages of early oxygen supplementation in children with pneumonia for preventing more severe disease or subsequent hypoxaemia. The lack of precision in these estimates means that the applicability of this evidence is not reasonable.</P>
<P>The evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of oxygen delivery methods suggests that nasal prongs may be more effective than nasopharyngeal and nasal catheters for oxygen delivery in paediatric patients with LRTIs, as nasal prongs cause fewer side effects and have not been associated with any severe adverse events. However, the results obtained for the risk of treatment failure and risk of adverse events are imprecise and do not allow us to confirm that nasal prongs are a more effective and safer method of oxygen delivery, as other authors have previously stated (<LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1995</LINK>). Therefore, there is not enough evidence to define which of the non-invasive delivery methods is the best one to be used in the treatment of hypoxaemia in children with LRTI.</P>
<P>Since resources differ by setting, efficacy, patient tolerability, patient safety, cost and availability, all have to be considered when choosing the best non-invasive oxygen delivery method in the treatment of children with hypoxaemic LRTI. To help health workers make the correct decision, studies aimed at identifying the safest and most effective non-invasive oxygen delivery method are required. Further research must consider the efficacy, tolerability, safety and costs of the methods studied.</P>
<P>Regarding the prediction of hypoxaemia in children with LRTI, this review has shown that there is still no clinical sign, model or scoring system that accurately identifies hypoxaemic children. The measurement of SaO<SUB>2</SUB> is still a particularly important test for physicians to make the correct decision regarding whether or not to give oxygen supplementation to infants and children with LRTI. As many authors have stated, to improve the rational use of medical oxygen, it is necessary to invest resources in supplying clinical settings and all health facilities in low-income countries with oxygen saturation monitors. Having an oxygen saturation monitor in emergency rooms could contribute not only to the rational use of medical oxygen but also avoid the risk of secondary effects associated with the use of oxygen in infants and young children. In the long term, this investment could result in more cost-effective alternatives by minimising the 'waste' of oxygen.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-12-05 09:55:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>The quality of the evidence from the pilot study is low due to lack of precision of the estimates. It could be a consequence of the small sample size included in the study and the small number of events presented in the studied participants. Therefore, our confidence in the effects on the main outcomes is very uncertain and it is very likely that new research findings will change the direction of effects. A similar situation was seen for the evidence on the effectiveness of the oxygen delivery methods more commonly used as part of the treatment of LRTIs. We found evidence from more than one trial for the use of nasal prongs in comparison with nasopharyngeal catheter. However, for all other comparisons (nasal prongs versus nasal catheter, mask versus nasopharyngeal catheter and head box versus nasopharyngeal catheter) we only identified one study. The evidence for these comparisons is also therefore very uncertain.</P>
<P>We performed a complete 'Risk of bias' assessment for all included RCTs. The methods used for randomisation and outcome assessment in some of the studies were not clearly described and explanations were missing, therefore presenting a source of potential bias. The quality of the evidence, assessed following the GRADE framework, resulted in low to very low quality for the main outcomes (treatment failure and adverse events).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-09 01:55:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>It is unlikely that we have missed any relevant studies. We conducted a comprehensive search and contacted experts in the clinical field to identify unpublished studies. The selection process and independent data extraction performed by the review authors assessing the evidence minimised errors and bias in data extraction.</P>
<P>The major limitation of this review is the lack of information from RCTs or well-designed cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no RCTs reporting on non-invasive delivery methods other than those included in this review. The comparison between oxygen supplementation versus non oxygen (room air) as well as the comparison of nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter showed imprecise results for the outcome 'treatment failure', as a consequence of lack of power of the included studies, which showed a trend towards no difference between treatment groups.</P>
<P>Regarding safety outcomes, our results showed a trend towards an increased risk of nose ulceration with the nasopharyngeal catheter, a finding that is in consonance with the <LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1997</LINK> study results. For all other safety outcomes, the results were imprecise.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-05 01:49:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-12-04 22:37:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The real beneficial effects of the use of supplemental oxygen in children presenting with signs of severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) remain unclear. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of hypoxaemia within 60 hours after starting oxygen supplementation in comparison to no oxygen supplementation (room air), or in the improvement of respiratory signs after oxygen therapy was started. As this finding came from a very small and underpowered trial, physicians need to base their decision on the use of oxygen supplementation as part of the early treatment of the LRTI, taking into account the individual patient's situation.</P>
<P>Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheters seem to be similar in effectiveness and safety when used in patients with LRTI. However, to minimise the risk of severe adverse events such as pneumocephalus, the use of nasopharyngeal catheters in infants and small children must be restricted to settings where the medical staff are experienced in managing this type of catheter. Nasal catheters, described by <LINK REF="STD-Muhe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Muhe 1998</LINK>, could be better alternatives for infants when nasal prongs are not available.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There is no single clinical sign, model or scoring system that accurately identifies hypoxaemic children. When oxygen saturation measurement is not possible, following the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for oxygen supplementation will help healthcare workers treat the majority of hypoxaemic patients. Nevertheless, until more studies are conducted we still do not know which kind of patients will benefit from oxygen therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-05 01:49:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to focus on determining the effectiveness of oxygen therapy as part of the initial treatment of LRTI in children. New trials should ensure a sufficient number of patients, which can be achieved by basing the calculation of sample size on the current rates of hypoxaemia in children, taking into account their baseline characteristics as well as the differences in their baseline risk.</P>
<P>Studies which aim to identify the safest and most effective non-invasive oxygen delivery method are also needed. Further research must consider not only the efficacy but the tolerability and safety of the oxygen delivery methods. It is necessary to establish which supplies or staff skills (or both) are necessary for the implementation of such methods (i.e. equipment for oxygen administration, nursing care) to be able to determine the cost of therapy and the infrastructure needs for successful implementation.</P>
<P>For future studies, researchers should encourage high standards of study conduct by reducing the risk of bias in treatment allocation and outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Home treatment with oxygen therapy is still widely practised without evidence of its risks or benefits. Therefore studies are needed to identify the optimal duration of oxygen therapy and to determine the indicators for prescribing oxygen supplementation following hospital discharge.</P>
<P>This review did not consider studies assessing nasal continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) for supporting children with LRTIs. However, the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Thia-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thia 2008</LINK> suggest that children with bronchiolitis who do not require immediate invasive ventilatory support could benefit by being treated with nasal CPAP. A review assessing its potential effectiveness and safety in the treatment of LRTIs, particularly bronchiolitis, is needed.</P>
<P>In order to obtain valid data from the oxygen saturation values expected in children aged from three months to five years living at different altitudes, new, large, multicentre studies involving children from different altitudes are required. These types of studies could help standardise the definition of hypoxaemia requiring oxygen supplementation therapy and determine the adequate management of hypoxaemic children.</P>
<P>Finally, this review tried to assess the clinical signs and symptoms that could indicate the presence of hypoxaemia in children with severe LRTI, but because of the scope of this review we did not perform a subgroup analysis in malnourished children, and we consider that this subgroup of the population may require special attention at the time of clinical assessment to determine the need for supplemental oxygen. Therefore, a review that specifically aims to define the accuracy of signs and symptoms presenting in hypoxaemic children with LRTI is desirable.</P>

<P>As highlighted in the <LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK> section, during the development of this review we decided to consider observational studies for inclusion to respond to the following secondary objective (already considered in the protocol for this review): to determine the indications for oxygen therapy in children with LRTIs (i.e. to describe the oxygen saturation values or clinical signs that would indicate the use of oxygen therapy). The main reason for this deviation from the protocol was that, as we did not find any trials comparing oxygen versus no oxygen therapy in these patients, we could not determine the indications for that intervention for this specific population. We consider it very important that clinicians can make decisions about oxygen therapy in this population when no oximeters are available.</P>
<P>This decision involved an amendment to the search strategy, as described in the <LINK TAG="SEARCH_METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Search methods for identification of studies</LINK> section.</P>

<P>This review has two large aims: one relates to the effectiveness and safety of oxygen supplementation therapy and oxygen delivery methods in children presenting with severe LRTI; the second aim is to identify clinical predictors of hypoxaemia in children. This last question has been addressed as a secondary objective and we tried to answer it by including observational studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms of children presenting with LRTI in detecting hypoxaemia. However, we excluded studies conducted in specific populations with other respiratory problems (such as chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, complicated pneumonia) and studies conducted in specific populations with other underlying diseases. There is an important amount of evidence addressing this question in specific populations, such as malnourished children that we, as authors, consider could be included as part of the synthesis of evidence as subgroup analyses in a review that specifically aims to address this diagnostic question.</P>
<P>The above reasons mean that in future publications we will split this review in two reviews: 1) one intervention review: 'Oxygen therapy for lower respiratory tract infections in children between 3 months and 15 years of age', which will focus just on the effectiveness and safety of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods, and 2) one diagnostic test accuracy review, which will focus on signs and symptoms that accurately predict hypoxaemia. In doing this we will be able to use appropriate tools for synthesising the diagnostic test evidence (such as methods for summarising sensitivity and specificity results, and the specific GRADE framework for assessing the quality of evidence from diagnostic test studies). We will also be able to include new studies conducted in malnourished children and conduct the appropriate subgroup analysis by type and severity of underlying disease, altitude where patients live, etc.<BR/>

<P>The main outcome measures were hypoxaemia and outcome of illness (died or survived). Recognised signs and symptoms, including very fast breathing (&gt; 60 breaths/min), cyanosis, grunting, nasal flaring, chest retractions, head nodding and auscultatory signs and signs of general depression in the child, were compared between ALRI and non-ALRI cases. From all the patients, 494/1726 (28.6%) had hypoxaemia (SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 90%) (268 were female and 208 male) and from this, only (49.2%) presented hypoxaemia among those having diagnosis of ALRI (154/313). A total of 141 children died, 60 (42.1%) female, and hypoxaemia was documented in 56 (39.6%) of the deaths, mortality was reported in 33 of the ALRI patients. Nasal flaring (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.70 to 8.74) and chest retraction (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.91 to 11.92) predicted hypoxaemia in ALRI but not in non-ALRI</P>

<P>Results are presented as several distributions: stratification into 5 age groups between (&lt; 2, 2 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 60, &gt; 60 months), distribution according to main primary diagnoses, distribution according to prevalence of hypoxaemia by primary diagnosis including ALRI and others. Type of disease subgroups were considered in the analysis for hypoxaemic on arrival and non-hypoxaemic after 10 min of oxygen therapy. Only ALRI was presented with different signs (fast breathing, cyanosis, grunting, nasal flaring, chest retractions, head nodding and inability to feed or lethargy) and compared between hypoxaemic and non hypoxaemic. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for this review; they are not presented by age group nor by disease severity.
