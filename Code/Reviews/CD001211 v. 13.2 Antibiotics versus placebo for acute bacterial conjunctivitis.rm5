<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infective condition in which one or both eyes become red and inflamed. The condition is not normally serious and in most cases resolves spontaneously. People with acute conjunctivitis are often given antibiotics, usually as eye drops or ointment, to speed recovery. The benefits of antibiotics to the sufferer of conjunctivitis have been questioned. We found 11 randomised controlled trial (RCTs) from different parts of the world which recruited a total of 3673 participants overall. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality, and we graded the remainder as poor quality. This updated review provides clearer evidence that use of antibiotic eye drops can speed up the resolution of symptoms and infection, and that they are unlikely to be associated with any serious side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-19 15:24:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (<A HREF="http://www.opengrey.eu/">www.opengrey.eu/</A>), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-31 15:05:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-31 14:45:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is estimated that 2% to 5% of all general practice consultations are eye related (<LINK REF="REF-Dart-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dart 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1995</LINK>). Data from Norway suggest that acute infective conjunctivitis is suspected in approximately 3% of patients seen in general medical practice, with this diagnosis being correct in two-thirds of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hovding-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovding 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hovding-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovding 2008</LINK>). Acute infective conjunctivitis is therefore one of the most frequently encountered ocular disorders in primary care. Such infection is usually viral or bacterial in aetiology. Infection of the conjunctiva produces a number of local symptoms including red eyes, discharge and discomfort.</P>
<P>Viral conjunctivitis is usually caused by adenovirus infection, which is contagious and is responsible for many of the epidemics that occur in school-aged children, but is in most cases self limiting; a small proportion of patients may, however, develop longer-lasting visual problems.</P>
<P>Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly due to infection with <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I>, <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>or <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>. Bacterial conjunctivitis is also regarded as self limiting. However, antibiotics are generally considered desirable on the grounds that they seem to speed recovery, reduce relapse and may prevent important sight-threatening complications such as orbital cellulitis, keratitis and panophthalmitis.</P>
<P>As bacterial and viral conjunctivitis may be difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds, and eye swabs are not considered practical (on grounds of delay and cost), many doctors will treat all presumed cases of infective conjunctivitis with a broad-spectrum antibiotic.</P>
<P>Topical antibiotic treatments are most commonly used; some of these also contain topical steroid therapy. Systemic antibiotic therapy has been advocated by some (<LINK REF="REF-Wald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wald 1997</LINK>) in order to prevent the development of 'conjunctivitis-otitis syndrome' (i.e. conjunctivitis followed by acute otitis media).</P>
<P>There has been significant public and professional concern regarding the use of chloramphenicol eye drops because of the associated rare risk of bone marrow aplasia. This concern led to a considerable reduction in its use in the United States and there have been calls for its use in the United Kingdom (UK) to also be curtailed (<LINK REF="REF-Doona-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doona 1995</LINK>). More recent work, however, suggests that these risks of bone marrow aplasia may have been over-stated (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 1998</LINK>). The widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has also led to some concerns that antibiotic resistance may become a significant problem.</P>
<P>The management of common infections encountered in primary care has undergone a radical transformation over the past 15 years. Previously it would have been regarded as heretical to question the use of antibiotics for infections such as sinusitis, otitis media and sore throat (pharyngitis/tonsillitis), which was near universally routine. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews have since cast doubt on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for these conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of these developments, it is timely to assess whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This review reports an updated assessment of the question, incorporating data on newer available treatments (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 2010</LINK>) and in so doing updates previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 2005</LINK>; New Reference; New Reference; New Reference).</P>

<P>These are the six parameters/questions used to assess risk of bias.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>
<LI>Was allocation adequately concealed?</LI>
<LI>Were the patients and researcher masked (blinded) to the allocated intervention?</LI>

<P>We deemed questions that were answered 'Yes' to indicate a low risk of bias and considered those answered 'No' at high risk of bias. Sometimes, insufficient information was available to allow a parameter to be assessed in which case a question would be answered as 'Unclear'.</P>
<P>From this assessment, we assigned an overall grade to each study: A &#8211; low risk of bias; B - moderate risk of bias; C &#8211; high risk of bias. </P>

<P>We undertook our quantitative meta-analyses of outcomes on an intention-to-treat basis using random-effects modelling. We expressed the results as risk ratios (RR with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) and risk difference (RD with 95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We performed tests for statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We assessed clinical remission with a denominator based on the total number of participants who had been randomised and this was therefore an intention-to-treat analysis. In contrast, we assessed microbiological remission with a denominator based on those patients who had demonstrated microbiological growth in the cultures from their eyes: i.e. 'culture-confirmed' bacterial conjunctivitis. The analysis of clinical cure therefore included patients who were not confirmed to have bacterial conjunctivitis and may have had viral conjunctivitis. This reflects day-to-day clinical practice as many clinicians will choose to start treatment in the absence of culture results.</P>
<P>In our meta-analyses, we included all randomised participants in the reports of clinical outcomes. However, in tests of microbiological cure we used the denominator of those who had had culture-proven bacterial conjunctivitis at the beginning of the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Controls</HEADING>
<P>All of the trials were 'vehicle-controlled', i.e. they used control preparations that did not contain any active antibiotic-related ingredient. However, in some trials the vehicle drop mixture contained an antiseptic, which may have had an impact on outcomes in the placebo arm. The active and placebo ingredients are detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In order to quantify the effect size of the antiseptic on acute bacterial conjunctivitis it would be necessary to investigate these drops separately against saline controls or no treatment arms. A no treatment arm would be impossible to mask and so would be open to bias. The results of the trials we present are the results measuring the additional effect of the antibiotic over the vehicle drops.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2008</LINK> used the outcome of clinical resolution which was evaluated at day six or seven. Clinical resolution was considered to be the absence of the three signs of bulbar conjunctival injection, palpebral conjunctival injection and ocular discharge. The secondary outcome was microbiological eradication, also at day six or seven, and was scored categorically from zero (eradicated) to three (worsening) compared with baseline, following gram-staining and other tests.</P>
<P>The trials used different combinations of outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Gigliotti-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gigliotti 1984</LINK> used clinical cure and microbiological eradication which were each assessed as a dichotomous outcome: cured or not cured, at two points in time after treatment was commenced: 'early' days three to five, and 'late' days eight to 10. This trial considered a participant to be clinically cured "if the eye was normal by physical examination"; participants' symptoms were not included in this assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gross-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 2003</LINK> used a culture test-of-cure taken at the visit on day seven. This indicated the outcome of bacterial eradication. The secondary outcome of 'clinical cure' was assessed from bulbar conjunctival injection and conjunctival discharge.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Karpecki-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karpecki 2009</LINK> defined the primary outcome as clinical resolution, i.e. the absence of conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at day eight. All signs and symptoms of acute bacterial conjunctivitis were rated on a four-point scale.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leibowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leibowitz 1991</LINK> classified 'early' as day three and measured microbiological outcome as one of four categories: pathogen eradication, pathogen reduction, pathogen persistence or pathogen proliferation. The eradication and reduction group were grouped together as signifying a positive outcome, and persistence and proliferation were grouped together to represent a negative outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK> classified 'early' as days two to three and assessed clinical outcome categorically as either: cured, improved, no change or worsened: the cured and improved categories were combined together as a positive outcome. This trial categorised clinical outcome on the basis of a combination of physical signs and participant symptoms. Microbiological outcome was also recorded at days two to three as: pathogen eradication, pathogen suppression or pathogen persistence; these measures were also measured at a 'late' stage in the trial at days five to seven. To facilitate analysis the eradicated and suppressed group were combined together as reflecting a positive outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rietveld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rietveld 2005</LINK> used clinical remission at day seven, defined as the absence of any symptoms or signs of conjunctivitis, which was confirmed by the general practitioner. Microbiological eradication rates were also assessed at day seven.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK> used clinical cure at seven days as the primary outcome measure, this being assessed from a parent-held diary.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 2011</LINK> examined clinical resolution in all randomised patients at day four or five and also eradication of the baseline bacterial infection in those with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tauber-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tauber 2011</LINK> concentrated on microbiology outcomes at day four ± one day. Microbiological success was determined in the "worst eye" if all bacterial isolates which had been recovered at day one were eradicated by day four.</P>
<P>

<P>Despite relatively high heterogeneity between different studies (discussed below), given that the trial effects were all in the same direction, we considered it appropriate to pool data across studies for 'early' and 'late' outcomes for rates of both clinical and microbiological remission.</P>
<SUBSECTION>

<P>Pooling the data from six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gigliotti-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gigliotti 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpecki-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karpecki 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tepedino-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tepedino 2009</LINK>), we calculated a risk ratio (RR) of 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) for 'early' (day two to five) clinical remission with antibiotics when compared with placebo. There was high heterogeneity I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 56%; this is according to the commonly used threshold of I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 40% being considered to be high. This is probably a reflection of the fact that the different studies used different ages of participants, infected with different types of bacteria and treated with different antibiotics - sometimes in different strengths of preparation. These factors are the most likely explanations for the high heterogeneity. In this context, authors are sometimes hesitant to pool data into a meta-analysis, however, we believe that this exercise is justified as there appeared to be broad agreement between the studies of the direction of the effect (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). By day five, 30% (95% CI 27 to 35) of cases receiving placebo had improved and 40% (95% CI 27 to 43) of those receiving antibiotics had improved. The cure rate in the placebo arm is 30% (derived by dividing numbers of cure events in the placebo group by the total number of participants in the placebo group (control event rate) and calculating 95% CIs for this outcome). The cure rate in the antibiotic group is 40% (similarly derived by dividing the number of cure events in the antibiotic group by the total number of participants in the antibiotic group). Therefore, the summary risk difference was 10% (40% to 30%) in those receiving two to five days of antibiotic treatment.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The increased absolute risk difference due to treatment with antibiotic eye drops was 11% for 'early' clinical remission and 9% for 'late' clinical remission, in comparison to treatment with placebo drops. The baseline remission rate of 30% with placebo by day five could be considered to be quite high. There may be some effect of administering antiseptic vehicle-placebo eye drops three or four times a day which may have contributed to this. However, there may also be some bias, as in <LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2008</LINK> twice as many participants discontinued in the placebo arm as in the treatment arm due to lack of efficacy. This would increase the measured effectiveness of the placebo arm as these data were not imputed in any way.</P>
<P>Antibiotic treatment was associated with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) for 'early' clinical remission and a RR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) for 'late' clinical remission. It was also associated with a RR of 'early' microbiological cure of 1.55 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) and 'late' microbiological cure of 1.37 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). It appears that there is a higher rate for 'early' microbiological cure than for 'early' clinical cure, suggesting that clinical cure lags behind microbiological eradication. This lag may also be in evidence at the 'late' time point.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:34:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There are several limitations to this review. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently cited to be a 'self limiting' condition. However, its natural history cannot be inferred from the trials included in this review because there is likely to be some effect of applying placebo eye drops containing antiseptic three or four times a day. This is perhaps reflected in the relatively high proportion (30%) of placebo arm patients who achieved clinical cure by day five (and 41% by days six to 10).</P>
<P>All the studies used different antibiotics, so no recommendations can be made on the basis of this review as to which of these is superior to any other or indeed which may be particularly useful for specific organisms.</P>
<P>There was no attempt in any of the studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of treating acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This would be a very useful study in the context of a self limiting condition.</P>
<P>As all of the trials show some benefit of antibiotics over placebo it would seem reasonable to conclude that these results are generalisable to the use of similar antibiotics for acute bacterial conjunctivitis in similar primary and secondary care settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:35:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We clearly assessed the two primary care studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rietveld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rietveld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>) as being of higher quality than the remaining studies. We assessed the remaining nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gigliotti-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gigliotti 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpecki-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Karpecki 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leibowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Leibowitz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauber-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tauber 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tepedino-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tepedino 2009</LINK>) as being at high risk of bias and thus lower quality.</P>
<P>In three of the four meta-analyses we found high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 40%). The different antibiotics used across the studies may partly account for this and when there are appropriate studies available in the future it may help to do a subgroup analysis according to antibiotic.</P>
<P>Another factor possibly contributing to this heterogeneity was the differing time periods of administration of antibiotics. For example, although studies included in the 'early' groups administered antibiotics for approximately five days, this may have actually been for a total of three to six days of antibiotic drops. Therefore this is a highly heterogeneous group and it is difficult to give clear recommendations on the appropriate time period for antibiotic administration.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:36:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>As AS was an author of <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>, he did not participate in selection, quality assessment, data extraction and interpretation of this trial; instead, this was done by UN and SM.</P>
<P>This review process should have minimum bias. The broad search strategy, performed in conjunction with <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, should have captured as many relevant studies as possible. This means that both completed and ongoing trials which have been appropriately coded by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group were included. Two authors then independently chose the relevant articles from this list. We included trials published in any language, thus minimising bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-31 15:00:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This latest review confirms the previous evidence that treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotics offers some benefits in speeding up early resolution and more clearly establishes that more modest benefits are also apparent in relation to later resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jefferis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferis 2011</LINK> conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis of these trials, which also found that antibiotics confer modest benefits in improving symptom resolution.</P>

<P>There remains only a small evidence base of two trials directly relevant to primary care (<LINK REF="STD-Rietveld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rietveld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2005</LINK>) where the majority of cases are seen and managed. However, the remaining nine trials may be generalised to some extent and add to this evidence. Early clinical and microbiological remission rates by day five are improved following administration of a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic and these benefits persist but are more modest for later resolution. Given the self limiting nature of conjunctivitis, operating a wait and see policy to see if symptoms/infection spontaneously resolve appears reasonable. It is also appropriate to consider use of antibiotic eye drops as these increase the speed of resolution of symptoms associated with acute bacterial conjunctivitis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-23 17:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is required in primary care assessment and treatment to understand better the natural history of conjunctivitis in these settings, to ascertain whether with no active treatment the resolution rates seen in the placebo arm are indeed due to spontaneous resolution or whether they reflect the impact of the vehicle of the placebo. In addition, further research is needed to assess cost-effectiveness in this setting in terms of improving quality of life and reducing time off work and education.</P>
