<TITLE>Replacing the defective gene is a potential treatment for progressive lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-23 08:57:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of delivering the correct copy of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene directly to the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis in order to treat progressive lung disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In cystic fibrosis the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from progressive lung infection and damage which reduces life expectancy. Agents which can deliver a correct copy of the faulty CFTR gene to cells in the lungs may be an effective treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 20 April 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found four studies with 302 people to include in this review. The studies lasted from 29 days to 13 months. Three of these studies included both men and women aged 12 years and over and one study only included adult men. The studies compare gene therapy to a dummy treatment (placebo) both of which are inhaled as a mist into the lungs. The studies were of different designs and used different agents. This meant we could not combine their results.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Three of the studies, including the largest and most recent study, showed an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with CF given gene therapy. We did not find that any more clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of life, treatment burden or flare-up of lung disease had improved with treatment. In one study "influenza-like" symptoms were more common in people who received CFTR gene transfer agents but this was not reported when the agent was used repeatedly in a larger study. In those people who took the gene transfer agents, molecules and salt in their lower airways moved more like they do in healthy people.</P>
<P>The limited evidence of benefit does not support this as a routine therapy at present. We recommend that future studies are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be incorporated into a systematic review.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The most recent study provided detailed information on how the people were put into different treatment groups completely at random, and so we are satisfied that those taking part in the study had an equal chance of being in either group (CFTR gene transfer agent or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into. The other studies reported that people were put into groups at random but did not specify how, so we cannot be sure that there was an equal chance of them being in either group. We believe that the clinicians running all the studies did not know which treatment the people taking part were receiving and that in three of the studies those taking part did not know either, but we could not be sure whether the people taking part in the latest study knew which treatment they were receiving and what effect this knowledge might have on results. Unfortunately, the studies did not report all their results clearly; sometimes results were not reported in a way that we could use for the review and sometimes they were not reported at all. This reduced the certainty with which we judged the overall results.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-06-16 14:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and is characterised by chronic lung infection resulting in inflammation and progressive lung damage that results in a reduced life expectancy. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether topical CFTR gene replacement therapy to the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with improvements in clinical outcomes, and to assess any adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-05-23 08:56:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Date of most recent search: 05 May 2016.</P>
<P>An additional search of the <A HREF="http://www.gemcris.od.nih.gov/">National Institutes for Health (NIH) Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System (GeMCRIS)</A> was also performed for the years 1992 to 2015.</P>
<P>Date of most recent search: 20 April 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-31 11:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised controlled studies comparing topical CFTR gene delivery to the lung, using either viral or non-viral delivery systems, with placebo or an alternative delivery system in people with confirmed cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-25 08:03:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked for any available additional data. Meta-analysis was limited due to differing study designs.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-16 14:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Four randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, involving a total of 302 participants lasting from 29 days to 13 months; 14 studies were excluded. The included studies differed in terms of CFTR gene replacement agent and study design, which limited the meta-analysis. One study only enrolled adult males, the remaining studies included both males and females aged 12 years and over.</P>
<P>Risk of bias in the studies was moderate. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment was only described in the more recent study; the remaining three studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. All four studies documented double-blinding to the intervention, but there is some uncertainty with regards to participant blinding in one study. Some outcome data were missing from all four studies.</P>
<P>There were no differences in either the number of respiratory exacerbations or the number of participants with an exacerbation between replacement therapy or placebo groups at any time point. Meta-analysis of most respiratory function tests showed no difference between treatment and placebo groups, but the smallest study (n = 16) reported forced vital capacity (litres) increased more in the placebo group at up to 24 hours. A further study reported a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (litres) at 30 days after participants had received their first dose of favouring the gene therapy agent, but this finding was not confirmed when combined with at second study in the meta-analysis. The more recent study (n = 140) demonstrated a small improvement in forced vital capacity (per cent predicted) at two and three months and again at 11 and 12 months for participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to those receiving placebo. The same study reported a significant difference in the relative change in forced expiratory volume at one second (per cent predicted) at two months, three months and 12 months.</P>
<P>One small study reported significant concerns with "influenza-like" symptoms in participants treated with CFTR gene replacement therapy; this was not reported on repeated use of the same agent in a larger recent study.</P>
<P>There was no other evidence of positive impact on outcomes, in particular improved quality of life or reduced treatment burden.</P>
<P>Two studies measured ion transport in the lower airways; one (n = 16) demonstrated significant changes toward normal values in the participants who received gene transfer agents (P &lt; 0.0001), mean difference 6.86 (95% confidence interval 3.77 to 9.95). The second study (n = 140) also reported significant changes toward normal values (P = 0.032); however, aggregate data were not available for analysis. In the most recent study, there was also evidence of increased salt transport in cells obtained by brushing the lower airway. These outcomes, whilst important, are not of direct clinical relevance.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-27 09:58:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>One study of liposome-based CFTR gene transfer therapy demonstrated some improvements in respiratory function in people with CF, but this limited evidence of efficacy does not support this treatment as a routine therapy at present. There was no evidence of efficacy for viral-mediated gene delivery.</P>
<P>Future studies need to investigate clinically important outcome measures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:14:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-08 18:52:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest life-shortening disease in Caucasians and is caused by a single gene defect. It has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 2000 at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Bobadilla-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobadilla 2002</LINK>). The affected gene is responsible for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). There are many abnormalities or alterations of the CFTR gene that can affect the production and function of CFTR (<LINK REF="REF-Rowntree-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowntree 2003</LINK>). Normally, CFTR has an important role in co-ordinating salt transport across cell membranes. This role is particularly important in the lungs where an abnormality of CFTR results in dehydration of the surface liquid that lines the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Matsui-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsui 1998</LINK>). Consequently the airway is not able to remove bacteria and chronic airway infection results in an intense local inflammation and mucus secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2004</LINK>). Subsequently a cycle of increasing lung inflammation and lung damage progressively reduces lung function, leading eventually to premature death (often in the third or fourth decade of life) from respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-FitzSimmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzSimmons 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frederiksen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frederiksen 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-10 15:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>These disease processes could be prevented by inserting a correct copy of the CFTR gene into the cells of people with CF, a process termed CFTR gene transfer therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Griesenbach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesenbach 2004</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:14:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are three main reasons why CFTR gene transfer therapy has been proposed for CF lung disease:</P>

<P>Early laboratory studies demonstrated the successful transfer of the CFTR gene to cells and animal airways using a variety of different gene delivery methods (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 1996</LINK>). Essentially, delivery agents have been described as viral (where the CFTR gene is incorporated into a replication incompetent virus) and non-viral (most commonly positively-charged liposomes which when mixed with DNA increases uptake into cells) (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). Human studies using viral vectors suggest that topical delivery to nasal airway cells results in uptake of the CFTR gene and expression of the gene by the airway cells (<LINK REF="STD-Knowles-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Knowles 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zabner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zabner 1996</LINK>). These studies demonstrate some correction of abnormal salt transport; however, repeat dosing results in inflammation (immune-mediated) and no detectable gene transfer (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zabner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zabner 1996</LINK>). Repeated dosing of non-viral gene delivery agents does not result in such marked immune-mediated responses; however, steady-state levels of gene expression and functional changes have been less impressive than those achievable acutely with viral vectors (<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 2000</LINK>). Much effort is being directed towards developing gene transfer agents and strategies with both improved gene uptake and expression, and reduced immunogenicity (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griesenbach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesenbach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the initial review and earlier updates, two authors (TWRL and KWS) independently selected the studies to be included in the review. From 2015 two co-authors (JP-D and LP) selected studies. There was agreement between the authors on the suitability of studies for inclusion in the review.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-06-16 14:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>For the initial review and earlier updates, two authors (TWRL and KWS) independently extracted data for the review. From 2015 two co-authors (JP-D and LP) extracted data from the included studies. The authors used a standardised form to extract data from studies eligible for inclusion in the review. If the publications provided standard errors (SEs), the authors converted these to standard deviations (SDs). The authors undertook meta-analysis on data from all included studies.</P>
<P>As the effect of gene transfer therapy may be cumulative, we analysed studies with different durations of intervention separately. For example, we planned to combine studies of less than one month duration, studies between one and two months duration, three and four months duration and five and six months duration. We planned to combine studies longer than six months duration on a three-monthly basis. Regarding studies of less than one month duration, in a <I>post hoc</I> change to protocol, we did not consider it appropriate to combine six-hour data with Day 30 data, as data obtained within 24 hours of administration are related to monitoring of adverse effects rather than efficacy.</P>
<P>We report when measurements were taken by the primary investigators during the study, what measurements were reported within the published paper and what data we are reporting in the review (<I>see</I> Additional Tables (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-13 14:00:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In order to establish a risk of bias, two authors independently assessed the studies to be included in the review. Originally, TWRL and KWS assessed the methodological quality of each study based on a method described by Jüni and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). The authors assessed the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a description of the degree of blinding;</LI>
<LI>inclusion of all participants in an intention-to-treat analysis, regardless of whether they completed the treatment schedule or not;</LI>
<LI>whether there is a clear description of generation of allocation sequence, for example with a random numbers table;</LI>
<LI>whether concealment of allocation sequence is described, for example if neither investigators nor participants can foresee assignment to either treatment or control group.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There was agreement between the authors on the quality of studies for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>For more recent updates of the review, all authors assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the risk of bias tool developed by Cochrane (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-04-19 10:18:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For binary outcome measures, the authors calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies using the risk ratio (RR). For continuous outcomes, they recorded either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and SD. They calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Authors converted any SEs to SDs. To calculate the SD for change from baseline in bronchial potential difference from the most recent Alton study, authors assumed the correlation coefficient to be 0.9 and performed sensitivity analysis at a range of values (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). For studies reporting continuous outcomes at multiple time points there are currently no methods to analyse aggregate longitudinal data if individual patient data are not available. Therefore in this review the authors have carried out analysis at each individual time point reported and assumed zero correlation between results. For any outcomes producing time-to-event data (e.g. survival) or count data (e.g. number of days), they analysed the data using the most appropriate method.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-07-13 14:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The review authors planned to consider studies with a cross-over design for inclusion; however, they have concerns about the potential for 'hangover effects' following too brief a washout period (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 2003</LINK>). This is particularly pertinent for gene transfer therapy agents which may alter the natural history of the CF airway disease. The review authors would have analysed any data from cross-over studies that were eligible for inclusion using a method described by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Elbourne says that this approach will produce conservative results, as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Also, each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent. If cross-over studies are included in future updates of this review we will undertake a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of these studies on the overall result.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-06-16 15:01:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In order to allow an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the review authors sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the individual was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. The review authors contacted the investigators of one study and obtained some additional data for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-16 15:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Since the authors only included four studies and were not able to combine data for many outcomes, they did not assess heterogeneity. If they are able to include more studies in future updates of the review, they will assess heterogeneity through a visual examination of the combined data presented in the forest plots, and by considering the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) together with Chi<SUP>2</SUP> values and their CIs (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). This reflects the likelihood that variation of results across trials are due to heterogeneity rather than chance, and the authors will interpret this statistic using the following simple classification:</P>
<UL>
<LI>0% to 40%: might not be important;</LI>
<LI>30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.</LI>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-16 15:04:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In order to identify selective outcome reporting, where possible, the authors compared outcomes defined in the protocol with those reported in the full publication. The authors requested the protocol for the study from the primary investigators, corresponding author(s), or relevant pharmaceutical company and recorded whether the protocol was available or not. They also compared outcomes listed in the 'Methods' section of the final paper with those presented in the 'Results' section. For negative findings that were reported either only partially, or not at all, the authors contacted primary investigators for these data.</P>
<P>In future updates, should sufficient studies become available, the authors will attempt to assess whether this review is subject to publication bias by using a funnel plot (which graphically illustrates variability between studies and should not demonstrate a systematic difference). If the authors detect asymmetry, they will explore causes other than publication bias.</P>

One study recruited only male participants due to regulatory restrictions (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). The remaining three studies recruited both males and females with an approximately even gender split in each group, except for the treatment group in Moss 2004 where there were more than double the number of females to males (14 females, six males) (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regards to age, one study specified that all participants were adults with a mean age of 26.9 years (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>).

<P>Alton 2015 analysed the 136 participants (97% of total originally randomised) who received at least one dose of the study agent on an ITT basis; 116 (83%) participants received a minimum of nine doses of the study agent and comprised the per-protocol population (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).

These were measured in the lower airways using a bronchoscope and catheter. Both studies undertook bronchoscopy once before the administration of the study drug and repeated in Alton 1999 two days after the study drug was administered (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>) and at 28 days (plus or minus five days) after the final (12th) dose in Alton 2015 (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). Alton 2015 also undertook an analysis of nasal potential difference in a subgroup of participants who were additionally treated with placebo or CFTR gene therapy via a nasal spray device; this has not been included in analysis as it is not an efficacy measure for CFTR gene replacement therapy to the lung (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Baseline potential difference</HEADING>
<P>People with CF have a higher baseline potential difference than people without CF (<LINK REF="REF-Griesenbach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesenbach 2005</LINK>). An effective CFTR gene replacement intervention would therefore be expected to demonstrate a reduction in baseline potential difference. Data for Alton 1999 are for segmental bronchi, estimated from figures in the original paper (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). No significant change in baseline potential difference was seen in either the CFTR gene replacement group (n = 8), mean (SD) change -0.81 (9.02) millivolt (mV), or the placebo group (n = 8), mean (SD) change 2.53 (6.48) mV (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). When these data are entered in the review's analysis, there was no difference between the groups, MD -3.34 (95% CI -11.04 to 4.36) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>For Alton 2015, we calculated change in baseline potential difference from baseline and post-treatment data provided (mean (SEM)); assuming a correlation coefficient (Corr) of 0.9 to estimate the SD. There was no significant difference between treatment groups (CFTR gene therapy group n = 10; placebo n = 7), MD -0.30 (95% CI -2.90 to 2.30) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses at a range of values for Corr also showed no statistical difference between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). Alton 2015 demonstrated no significant difference in post-treatment (after 12 months) bronchial potential difference between treatment groups, MD 1.70 (95% CI -3.50 to 6.90) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">b. Response to perfusion with amiloride</HEADING>
<P>Since sodium absorption is increased in people with CF, a greater reduction in potential difference from baseline is seen in response to amiloride in participants with CF than in those without CF (<LINK REF="REF-Griesenbach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesenbach 2005</LINK>). Thus effective CFTR gene replacement should reduce the fall in potential difference seen following amiloride. Alton 1999 demonstrated no significant change in response to perfusion with amiloride in either the CFTR gene replacement group (n = 8) mean (SD) change -12.6 (14.66) or the placebo group (n = 8) mean (SD) change -16.50 (13.17) (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>).

Data from Alton 1999 have been estimated from figures in the original paper (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). The study reported that in the CFTR gene replacement group there was a significant improvement following perfusion with a zero chloride solution, mean (SD) 5.4 (3.82) (P &lt; 0.05), with no significant change in the placebo group, mean (SD) -1.46 (2.29) (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>).

In Alton 2015, high resolution CT scans were obtained from participants at baseline and at 28 days (plus or minus five days) after dose 12 of the study drug (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). Investigators then studied the following features: extent of bronchiectasis (scored per lobe on a range of 0 to 3); severity of bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickness (scored per lobe on a range of 0 to 4); small and large airway mucus plugs (scored per lobe on a range of 0 to 2); and gas trapping on expiratory CT (scored on a percentage basis). Results demonstrated a significant improvement in CT gas trapping for CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to placebo, MD &#8211;3.49 (95% CI &#8211;6.96 to &#8211;0.03) (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). For the remaining features (extent of bronchiectasis, severity of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and small and large airway plugs), there was no significant difference in the change in score between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Moss 2004, participants underwent a high resolution CT scan at baseline and on Day 90, 30 days after the third dose of study drug had been administered (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>). The CT scans were scored on a scale from 0 to 100 using an algorithm that had not been previously validated and was developed for this study. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of change in CT score from baseline at Day 90, with the CFTR gene replacement group (n = 18) mean (SD) -1.00 (3.00), placebo group (n = 17) mean (SD) 0.00 (6.00); MD -1.00 (95% CI -4.17 to 2.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>These data must be treated with caution as the scoring system had not been previously validated.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-24 14:42:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. They compared cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene replacement to placebo delivered to the lungs of participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies examined a liposome-based CFTR gene delivery agent (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). In Alton 1999 participants received a single dose of study drug with follow up for 29 days (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>) and in Alton 2015 participants received monthly doses for 12 months with follow up for up to 13 months (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). In Alton 2015, at 12 months participants who received CFTR gene transfer agents had an improvement in relative change in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) % predicted compared to those who had received placebo, MD 3.66 (95% CI 0.15 to 7.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). This was also demonstrated after two and three months, but not at the remaining time points over the 12-month study period (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). Alton 2015 also demonstrated significant improvements in FVC (% predicted) at two, three, 11 and 12 months in participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to placebo. Alton 1999 reported an significant increase in FVC (L) in the placebo group compared to the treatment group at up to 24 hours. With regards to adverse events, Alton 1999 reported "influenza-like" symptoms in seven out of eight participants who received the CFTR gene transfer reagents (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). In the larger Alton 2015, these symptoms were reported in one participant who had taken at least four doses and one in the placebo arm (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two Moss studies used a viral CFTR gene delivery system (AAV) with follow up for 150 to 210 days respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>). These studies were of similar design, although three doses were given in the Moss 2004 and two doses in Moss 2007. There were no significant differences in rate of exacerbation between the treatment group and placebo in either study. Moss 2004 demonstrated a significant improvement in respiratory function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) 30 days after participants had received their first dose of gene therapy agent. This finding was not confirmed in Moss 2007 or in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>). Neither Moss study nor our meta-analysis of FVC (L) showed any significant difference between treatment and placebo groups at either 30 days or two months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>No study reported on survival; however, no deaths were reported in three of the studies and the single death reported in one study was not treatment related.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-16 16:18:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Four trials recruiting 302 participants with CF were included in this review; three trials recruited a mixture of males and females aged 12 years and over (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>) and one recruited only adult males due to regulatory restrictions (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>). The mean age of participants in the four studies was 24.5 years. Homozygous &#8710;F508 was the commonest genotype in the studies. There are insufficient data reported in the studies for some outcomes considered to be important for this review: oral antibiotics (days or episodes); number of days as a hospital inpatient; need for extra treatment (physiotherapy); school or work attendance; height; and sputum rheology.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-27 10:06:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>All included studies had a parallel design. Overall there were minor issues with quality, in particular risk of bias from concealment, allocation and randomisation. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment are specified in just one study (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>); in the remaining studies, they are unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>). In Moss 2004, 83% of randomised participants received all three doses of study drug and it is not stated whether withdrawals had been originally allocated to the active or the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>). Post-allocation withdrawal also occurred in Moss 2007, but to a lesser extent study (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>). In Alton 2015, 83% of randomised participants received at least nine doses of study drug and were included in the per-protocol analysis. Reason for withdrawal was described up to the ninth dose, but it is not clear if participants withdrew after receiving nine doses (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). In Alton 2015, measures were taken and described to ensure adequate blinding for the participants, but this was a challenge as the placebo was a quite distinct solution (saline) compared to the gene therapy agent (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-16 16:20:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The review authors conducted a comprehensive literature search of online journal databases using the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group&#8217;s Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the ongoing online trials database (<A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>). In addition, authors approached known researchers in the field for relevant unpublished information and individual participant data. Two authors (TWRL and KWS) selected eligible trials and extracted data for the original review and earlier updates. For the update in 2016, two authors (LAP and JCP-D) independently undertook further study selection and data extraction. The analyses of this update were undertaken by one review author (AA). This methodological approach ensured that risks of bias in the review process were kept to a minimum.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-24 14:43:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>While the meta-analysis of most respiratory function tests showed no difference between treatment and placebo groups, the most recent study, Alton 2015, demonstrated a benefit in relative change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted and FVC % predicted at 12 months for participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to those receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). Concerns over safety with "flu-like" symptoms in most participants in the Alton 1999 study were not reported on repeated use in Alton 2015 (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). There was no other evidence of positive impact on outcomes, in particular improved quality of life, reduced treatment burden or exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Alton-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Alton 2015</LINK>). The limited evidence of efficacy does not support this as a routine therapy at present.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of efficacy for viral-mediated gene delivery from the remaining two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-06 10:37:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical studies examining the use of CFTR gene transfer reagents for CF lung disease should include outcome measures that are relevant to people with CF as well as clearly defined surrogate measures of efficacy. It is imperative that future studies of established or novel gene therapy reagents use a robust study design with clearly defined endpoints and adequate power. These studies must be reported in a full and transparent manner to enable the incorporation of data into systematic reviews. A clear cost analysis is essential for any emerging therapies, as this is likely to be a significant factor. In future updates of this review, we will include this as a pertinent secondary outcome measure.</P>

<P>5 ml volumes of pGM169 (13·25 mg)/GL67A (75 mg) or placebo (saline) were placed in AeroEclipse II breath-actuated nebulisers (Trudell Medical Instruments, London, ON, Canada). To avoid unblinding, nebulisers were taped and a tamper-proof seal was attached. Study medicines were prepared by unblinded trial pharmacists. Clinical study staff, participants and analysts were blind to allocation until database lock. 10 ml volumes were placed in opaque nasal spray devices (GSK parts No. AR5989 30 ml bottle/AR9488 30 ml actuator) and the device was primed.
