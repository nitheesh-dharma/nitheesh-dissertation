<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:50:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic disease, usually affecting the skin caused by a dimorphic (existing in two forms), aerobic (oxygen requiring) fungus called <I>Sporothrix schenckii</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2004</LINK>). The lesions may spread along the lymph channels.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Etiology and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The fungus exists in sphagnum moss, hay, other plant materials, and in the soil (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2001</LINK>). It enters the skin through small cuts or punctures from thorns, barbs, pine needles, or wires but is not spread from person to person. People working in horticulture e.g. tree surgeons, rose gardeners, greenhouse workers, farmers and others working on the soil, are at risk of getting sporotrichosis. It occurs worldwide in people of all ages and races and is observed more often in people aged between 20 and 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Feuerman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feuerman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laur-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laur 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajendran-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajendran 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherertz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherertz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chakrabarti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakrabarti 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonifaz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonifaz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2002</LINK>). The countries with the highest reported rates of infection are Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The clinical types of sporotrichosis are divided into four groups: fixed cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, cutaneous disseminated, and extracutaneous (<LINK REF="REF-Wiederman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiederman 1992</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Fixed cutaneous: infections are confined to a localised area of the skin. A nodule arises one to two weeks after infection, then slowly enlarges and frequently breaks down to form an ulcer.</LI>
<LI>Lymphocutaneous: infections will spread along lymphatic vessels to cause lesions along the lymph channels after development of the primary lesion.</LI>
<LI>Cutaneous disseminated: spread to other areas of the skin beyond the draining lymph node vessels as may happen in AIDS.</LI>
<LI>Extracutaneous: when the infection spreads from the skin to other internal sites of the body such as joints and bones, eyes and the central nervous system.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Systemic and disseminated sporotrichosis are uncommon but may follow the spread of infection from lymphocutaneous disease, sometimes involving joints, lungs, or the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Sherertz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherertz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of sporotrichosis should be based on culturing the organism from tissue or fluid obtained from infected sites (<LINK REF="REF-Stonecipher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stonecipher 1997</LINK>). Histopathology may be helpful but is not diagnostic. Immunodiffusion tests (antigen-antibody reaction) may be helpful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>The vast majority of infections are limited to the skin and the infections slowly get worse, but are rarely fatal. There are no reports of spontaneous resolution without treatment. Cases of joint, lung, and central nervous system infection have occurred but are very rare and usually occur only in people with diabetes or other disorders of the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-New-York-State-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">New York State 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:17:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>Several forms of treatment have been used, such as potassium iodide or sodium iodide taken by mouth, local heat administration, amphotericin B (an antibiotic) and azole anti-fungal drugs. Potassium iodide is an anti-fungal drug listed in the WHO essential drug list (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>) and generally thought to be the first choice for cutaneous sporotrichosis, including fixed and lymphocutaneous types, in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2000</LINK>). Local heat administration is considered as an adjunctive treatment and may be particularly effective in the early stages of infection with mild tissue injury. Amphotericin B is the traditional choice for systemic sporotrichosis. Azole anti-fungal drugs including ketoconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine are recommended for those people who have severe reactions to iodide, but these drugs are expensive and the period of treatment is long, so they are not widely used in high-prevalence areas of the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral potassium iodide in the treatment of sporotrichosis</HEADING>
<P>Five years after the first reported case of sporotrichosis in 1898, a series of reports began to appear in France which described its treatment with potassium iodide (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2003</LINK>). Although this simple chemical has been used for about 100 years, the mechanism of action is not clearly understood. It has been demonstrated that a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) shows no activity in vitro in the laboratory against <I>Sporothrix schenckii</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1991</LINK>), so it does not kill <I>Sporothrix schenckii</I> directly. It is now thought that macrophages (normal scavenger cells), can be stimulated by potassium iodide to inhibit growth of the fungus (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2001</LINK>). However, there are some Japanese and Indian studies that do show a direct anti-fungal effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinogi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinogi 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>A saturated solution of potassium iodide is administered in a slowly ascending dose beginning with 3 drops 3 times per day increasing until limited by adverse effects, or until a clinical response is achieved or until a maximum dose of roughly 40 drops per day is reached, (equivalent to 400 mg of iodine) (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1991</LINK>). The medication is relatively cheap but is unpalatable.</P>
<P>Contraindications include: hypersensitivity to iodide, acute bronchitis or acute tuberculosis, and pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1991</LINK>). Side-effects are common and include acne-like spots, nausea, vomiting, parotiditis (inflammation of the parotid gland), and hypothyroidism (reduced activity of the thyroid gland). Usually the adverse effects are mild and can be curtailed by decreasing the dosage or temporarily stopping the administration of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Wiederman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiederman 1992</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:53:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E Prescott">
<P>In the future, if there is any study included in the review, we will assess the methodological quality of each trial in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, and selective reporting; and classify them as 'low risk', 'moderate risk', or 'high risk' according to the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and as described in <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>a) The method of generation of the randomisation sequence;<BR/>In the future, if there is any study included in the review, an adequate approach for generating an allocation sequence with low risk of selection bias should be a random number table or computer software, and other simple random methods, for example, coin tossing, shuffling. All of the methods for generating the allocation sequence should be used before recruiting the participants.</P>
<P>Any future trial which only mentioned 'random' but lacked a description of the approach will be considered as having a moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>b) The method of allocation concealment - it will be considered 'adequate' if the assignment cannot be foreseen;<BR/>Low risk of selection bias: where measures have been taken to conceal allocation sequence, e.g. where the person who generated an allocation sequence did not attend to recruit the participants, central allocation, and the allocation sequences were conserved safely, for example, sealed in opaque envelopes or conserved in a locked computer, or another description that contains convincing elements of concealment.</P>
<P>Moderate risk of selection bias: where concealment of the allocation sequence was mentioned but the approach has not been reported clearly.<BR/>
</P>
<P>High risk of selection bias: where the concealment of the allocation sequence reported was inadequate, or where there was a possibility that those involved could foresee assignments.</P>
<P>c) Who was blinded/not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors);<BR/>Where both participants and results assessors were masked we will consider those trials as having a low risk of performance or/and detection bias.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We will consider single-blinding for results assessors as a moderate risk of performance or/and detection bias. However, if only the participants were blinded we will consider it as having a high risk of detection bias.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Non-blinding for detection of outcomes include quality of life and adverse events which we will consider as having a high risk of detection bias. The rule of blinding will not be used in reporting of mortality.</P>
<P>d) How many participants were lost to follow-up in each arm and whether reasons for losses were adequately reported;<BR/>e) Whether all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention-to-treat).<BR/>
<BR/>In addition, assessment will be made of the following:<BR/>
<BR/>f) Severity of the disease;<BR/>g ) Baseline comparison for severity of disease.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-02 18:23:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a future update where we have found suitable RCTs we expect both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. In this case we will analyse different comparisons separately. We will use risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and control events rates for reporting dichotomous data. We will also calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) if follow-up time and control event rates are similar for the different trials. We will express continuous data as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. We will estimate pooled results using a random-effects model (DerSimonin and Laird model).</P>

</P>
<P>Moderate risk of bias: trials which reported the rate of exclusions or/and attrition was about 10% whatever intention-to-treat analysis was used.<BR/>

We excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 1996</LINK>) because the intervention which was a full dose of potassium iodide taken once a day compared to the same dose split over three times a day, did not fulfil our criteria.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:52:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Although, potassium iodide has been widely used for Sporotrichosis for more than 100 years, unfortunately, no randomised placebo-controlled trial has been carried out. This situation reflects the fact that this is an under-researched condition, or maybe that it is very difficult to find participants to take part in trials. Organising trials may also be a challenge since cases may be rare and sporadic. Funding such trials may also be a problem.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-30 08:27:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-30 08:27:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There is no good evidence for or against oral potassium iodide as a treatment for sporotrichosis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-21 11:09:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Further research on oral potassium iodide in the treatment of Sporotrichosis is needed in order to define its efficacy and acceptability. Ideally any future trial should be of double-blind design in which both the assessor and participants are blinded; outcome measures should include quality of life, duration of cure and adverse events. Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardised monitoring or an effective self-reporting system. Also attention should be paid to long-term adverse effects on the thyroid gland.</P>
