<P>The importance of consumer involvement at all levels of the health services is widely recognised. This review shows that little research has been done to find the best ways of involving consumers in healthcare decisions at the population level. Most of the included trials compared consultations with consumers with no consultations with consumers. There is moderate quality evidence from two trials that involving consumers in the development of patient information material results in material that is more relevant, readable and understandable, without affecting anxiety. This 'consumer-informed' material can also improve knowledge. Two trials, which compared using consumer interviewers with staff interviewers as data collectors for patient satisfaction surveys, found small differences in satisfaction survey results, with less favourable results obtained when consumers were the interviewers. One trial comparing two informed consent documents, one developed with consumer input and the other developed by the trial investigators, showed that consumer input may have little if any impact on understanding of the trial described in the consent document. One trial, comparing two different methods for involving the public (telephone discussion and a face-to-face group meeting), showed that a face-to-face meeting is most likely to engage consumers and may result in different community health priorities.</P>

<P>We included six randomised controlled trials with moderate or high risk of bias, involving 2123 participants. There is moderate quality evidence that involving consumers in the development of patient information material results in material that is more relevant, readable and understandable to patients, without affecting their anxiety. This 'consumer-informed' material can also improve patients' knowledge. There is low quality evidence that using consumer interviewers instead of staff interviewers in satisfaction surveys can have a small influence on the survey results. There is low quality evidence that an informed consent document developed with consumer input (potential trial participants) may have little if any impact on understanding compared to a consent document developed by trial investigators only. There is very low quality evidence that telephone discussions and face-to-face group meetings engage consumers better than mailed surveys in order to set priorities for community health goals.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-24 10:56:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The importance of consumer involvement at all levels of the health services is widely recognised. Our review focuses on the effects of promoting and organising consumer involvement to inform or participate in decisions about health care for populations, including decisions about healthcare policies and planning (eg. inequalities in health care); clinical policies (eg. clinical practice guidelines); patient information materials (eg. that aim to inform patients about personal healthcare decisions); and healthcare research (eg. design of clinical or epidemiological studies, identification of relevant outcomes, priority setting).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential benefits of consumer involvement in health care</HEADING>
<P>The potential benefits of consumer involvement in health care include: policy, research, practice and patient information that includes consumers' ideas or addresses their concerns; improved implementation of research findings; better care; and better health. Consumer participation can be viewed as a goal in itself by encouraging participative democracy, public accountability and transparency. For example, the World Health Organization's Declaration of Alma Ata states that "The people have the right and duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning and implementation of their health care" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1978</LINK>). Consumers may offer different and complementary perspectives to those of professionals. Also, they may not have the same conflicts of interest and loyalties as professionals.</P>
<P>It is assumed that input from consumers in planning of health care can lead to more accessible and acceptable health services, and improve health and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2002</LINK>). Consumer involvement is also thought to lead to health research of greater quality and clinical relevance (<LINK REF="REF-Boote-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boote 2002</LINK>), and greater uptake of findings (<LINK REF="REF-Whitstock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitstock 2003</LINK>). There is a lack of research that reliably investigates whether consumer involvement achieves these intentions and, if so, which methods of consumer involvement are most effective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Potential barriers to consumer involvement in health care</HEADING>
<P>Consumer involvement in health care is also an idea that faces considerable resistance. Although most health professionals are dedicated, they face many challenging demands. They are hierarchically socialised and organised to view themselves as authorities. It is also claimed, for instance, that consumer involvement can make research projects costlier and longer than some researchers and grant-awarding bodies would expect, and that consumers may have biased views on certain health issues, which may threaten the traditional academic impartiality of knowledge development (<LINK REF="REF-Boote-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boote 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Consumers may not find it meaningful to function as consumer representatives because their opportunities for input and influence are minimised. There seems to be a lack of research that reliably investigates methods for overcoming such barriers to consumer participation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Framework for evaluating methods of consumer involvement</HEADING>
<P>Consumer involvement varies according to its purpose, the consumers involved, the degree of involvement, the methods employed to support this involvement, and the context. An early attempt to characterise consumer involvement, initiated largely by metropolitan institutions in high income countries, proposed a 'ladder of participation.' Rungs on the ladder represented increasing degrees of participation, from: non-participation or manipulation and therapy; through the tokenism of informing, consulting and placating; to citizen power through partnership, delegated power and citizen control (<LINK REF="REF-Arnstein-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnstein 1969</LINK>). A similar scale has been described, drawing on participatory processes for research in low and middle income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cornwall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornwall 1996</LINK>). This acknowledges the tokenism that occurs at one end of the scale and the co-learning or independent collective action at the other.</P>
<P>Besides the degree of involvement, ways of supporting this involvement vary widely. Methods may involve individuals or groups of consumers, and the latter may be pre-existing or convened for the purpose. A two-dimensional representation of models of involvement combining degrees of involvement (from information to control), and distinguishing individual and group involvement, has been employed to describe consumer involvement in mental health services in England (<LINK REF="REF-Glasby-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasby 2003</LINK>). How consumer involvement develops and how it is viewed by health professionals and by different sectors of society is also influenced by who initiated specific encounters: the consumers or the professional services (<LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>We chose a framework for describing consumer involvement constructed for a systematic review of consumer involvement in setting research agendas (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). When employed in Oliver and colleagues' review, the framework accommodated the diverse methods spanning all these dimensions (degree of involvement, individuals or groups of consumers, and initiated by consumers or professionals) across low, middle and high income countries.</P>
<P>For this framework, Arnstein's ladder of participation was simplified to the three steps employed by the Consumers in NHS Research Support Unit (since renamed INVOLVE): consultation, collaboration and consumer control (<LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2004</LINK>). 'Consultation' was defined as asking consumers for their views and using these views to inform decision-making. For example, funders of research have held one-off meetings with consumers to ask them about their priorities for research, or written to consumers in accessible terms to invite their views. Consumers' views were not necessarily adopted, although they may have informed decisions. 'Collaboration' was described as active, on-going partnership with consumers. For example, consumers have been committee members or collaborated less formally to complete a task. Again, there is no guarantee that consumers' views will influence decisions, but there is more opportunity for them to be heard than in consultations. 'Consumer-controlled' research was described as consumers designing, undertaking and disseminating the results of a research project. Professionals were only involved at the invitation of the consumers.</P>
<P>Within this framework, methods were further distinguished by descriptions of the forum for communication (such as one-to-one interviews, focus groups, citizens' juries, town meetings, committee meetings, working groups) and methods for decision making (such as informal committee consensus, voting, ranking, scoring, visual scales and Delphi surveys). The presence or absence of transparent descriptions of methods for decision making can distinguish implied involvement in decisions (such as in committee meetings), some examples of which are misleading, and explicit involvement in decisions. This can inform interpretations of tokenism, which is widespread in consumer involvement.</P>
<P>All of these interventions are worthy of review. Although our framework for consumer involvement helped us characterise the interventions, care needs to be taken with interpretation, considering the diverse purposes of consumer involvement and the different cultural and political contexts.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Need for comparative evaluations of consumer involvement</HEADING>
<P>Relevant reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Boote-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boote 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2004</LINK>) revealed a lack of comparative evaluations of promoting or organising consumer involvement in health care. Therefore, in the previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK>, we searched for quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series analyses, and controlled before-after studies in addition to randomised controlled trials. As we identified and included five randomised controlled trials, we decided to search for randomised controlled trials only for the updated review (2009). </P>

<UL>
<LI>Healthcare policy was defined as laws, rules, financial and administrative orders made either by governments, non-government organisations or private organisations, that are intended to directly affect the provision and use of health services.</LI>
<LI>Healthcare research included clinical research, epidemiological research and health services research (investigating need, demand, supply, use, and outcome of health services).</LI>
<LI>Clinical practice guidelines were defined as "systematically developed statements to assist both practitioner and patient decisions in specific circumstances" (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1992</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Patient information material included printed, audio-visual and electronic information that is intended to help patients to make informed decisions about healthcare.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used a framework for describing consumer involvement that distinguishes methods and comparisons in terms of the degree of consumer involvement, the forum for communication, how consumers are involved in actual decision-making, how consumers are recruited, and how consumers/professionals are trained and supported (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We give examples of these categories in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section.</P>
<P>Relevant comparisons included: the development of healthcare policy, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material with or without consumer involvement; and different methods of consumer involvement, for example involving consumers as members of the steering group of a research project, versus involving them as participants of focus groups. For training and support interventions, comparisons include both providing versus not providing training or support for consumer involvement, and providing two or more different forms of training or support. We did not include interventions where consumers are involved as lay health workers or teachers only.</P>
<P>Evaluations of consumer involvement in healthcare research does not include individuals participating in trials as sources of data alone (ordinary trial participants).

We retrieved the full text of potentially relevant reports and two (of the same) review authors assessed the relevance of those studies, assessed the quality of included studies and extracted data from included studies independently. We resolved disagreements by discussion, including another review author when necessary.</P>
<P>We used standard criteria to assess the methodological quality of studies (protection against bias) (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and extracted information about concealment of allocation, follow-up of professionals, follow-up of patients or episodes of care, blinded assessment of primary outcomes, baseline measurement, reliable primary outcome measures and protection against contamination. The data extractors independently assessed overall quality (risk of bias) for each main outcome within each trial, using the following guidelines:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: all seven criteria scored as 'done';</LI>
<LI>Moderate risk of bias: one or two criteria scored as 'not clear' or 'not done';</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: more than two criteria scored as 'not clear' or 'not done'.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>In the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> we used the following convention for rating allocation concealment:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Grade A: Adequate concealment;</LI>
<LI>Grade B: Uncertain;</LI>
<LI>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment;</LI>
<LI>Grade D: Not used (no attempt at concealment).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We extracted the following additional information from included trials using a standardised data extraction form:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Type of study (randomised controlled trial);</LI>
<LI>Type of process (development of healthcare policy, clinical practice guidelines, patient information material, or healthcare research);</LI>
<LI>Purpose and scope for the activity in which consumers are involved;</LI>
<LI>Trial setting (country, key features of the system in which the process is undertaken);</LI>
<LI>Characteristics of the consumer participants (individual patients or members of the public; or members of organised groups);</LI>

<LI>Main outcome measures and trial duration; and</LI>
<LI>The results for the main outcome measures.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We calculated a mean difference for one outcome reported by <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> using a fixed effect model. The remaining results of the included trials were not pooled because of heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures.</P>
<P>We had postulated the following potential explanatory factors for variation in effects: differences in the characteristics of the interventions, settings, types of process, trial quality. However, the interventions and outcome measures in the included trials were so diverse, that this was not relevant.</P>
<P>We have summarised what is known about the effects of various ways of involving consumers, noting important methods of involvement for which no evaluations were found. Quality of the evidence (the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct) was graded using the approach recommended by the GRADE Working Group (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). This approach distinguishes between four grades of evidence: high, moderate, low and very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>We aimed to identify important factors that should be taken into consideration by anyone contemplating using any of the identified means of promoting consumer involvement, including: possible trade-offs (of the expected benefits versus harms, if any, and costs), the quality of the available evidence, possible differences in baseline levels of consumer involvement, and other important factors that might have affected the applicability of the available evidence to practice in specific settings. As we did not find much evidence, we have provided a framework for future evaluations and guidance for evaluating interventions to involve consumers in healthcare decisions at the population level (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK>, we established a consumer panel (e-mail discussion list), consisting of members of the Cochrane Consumer Network. The consumer panel was asked to undertake tasks, such as making review authors aware of unpublished studies that could be considered for inclusion and commenting on drafts of the protocol and review. We did not involve consumers in the work of updating this review in 2009, as we did not make changes to the objectives or selection criteria, apart from the decision to include randomised controlled trials only.</P>

<P>Revised and updated searches for the 2009 version of the review retrieved an additional 5011 citations. We obtained full text copies of 22 articles for further assessment. One trial met our inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of six included trials.</P>
<P>We identified one trial about consumer involvement in healthcare policy (<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK>), three trials about consumer involvement in healthcare research (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK>) and two trials about consumer involvement in the development of patient information material (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>). All of the identified trials evaluated consumer consultation to inform the development of healthcare policy, research or patient information. None of them evaluated consumer involvement in decision making during this development.</P>
<P>Consumers in <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK> were involved in the development of an informed consent document. Consumers in <LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK> were trial participants and were also involved in healthcare decisions at the population level (that is, involved in determining healthcare priorities). Consumers in <LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> were involved in the preparation of patient information leaflets. Consumers in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> were involved as data collectors. In <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> consumers were also involved in the preparation of a satisfaction survey instrument.</P>
<P>We identified no randomised controlled trials about consumer involvement in the development of clinical practice guidelines.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK> compared three different methods of consulting consumers. Participants were members of community organisations, and their task was to inform health service priorities by completing a survey. All participants in the telephone discussion and face-to-face meeting groups, and 8 of the 17 participants in the mail survey group completed the same survey twice. The two intervention groups participated in either telephone discussion or a community face-to-face meeting before completing the survey for the second time. The trial investigated if two-way discussion (telephone discussion or face-to-face meeting) resulted in different healthcare priorities being identified by consumers (and these outcome measures were classified as consumer influence on decisions). In the framework for describing consumer involvement (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) the methods used in <LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK> were categorised as repeated consultations using different forums for communication (face-to-face meeting, telephone discussion, mail survey).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> organised patient satisfaction surveys among participants recruited from mental health outpatient clinics. Participants were interviewed about their satisfaction with mental health services. The trial investigators collaborated with consumers (former patients) in an ongoing working relationship by involving them in this research as data collectors (interviewers). The intervention group was interviewed by consumers, while the control group was interviewed by health professionals. Consumer interviewers and health professionals used the same survey instrument. The trials investigated whether data collected by consumer interviewers differed from data collected by health professionals (outcome measures classified as consumer influence on resource utilization). In the framework for describing consumer involvement (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> worked collaboratively with the interviewers. Despite the collaborative working relationship, there is no evidence that the consumer interviewers participated in decision-making.</P>
<P>The third trial in this category (<LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK>) evaluated an informed consent document for use in a cluster randomised controlled trial (parent trial) investigating the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise on Gulf War veterans' illnesses. Participants were Gulf War veterans eligible for the parent trial. The intervention group received a consent document developed with input from a focus group of consumers (Gulf War veterans). The control group received a consent document developed by professionals (the trial investigators). The primary outcome measure was participants' self-rated understanding of the parent trial (classified as consumer influence on healthcare outcomes). Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with study participation, adherence to the protocol and refusal to participate. Consumers in the focus group used the investigator-developed consent document as a starting point for developing their consent document. They only made minor changes to the background, procedures and benefits sections of the document, and lowered the reading level slightly. In terms of the framework for describing consumer involvement (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK> consulted consumers face-to-face in three focus group sessions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patient information material (two included trials and two excluded trials)</HEADING>
<P>Two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>) and one excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2002</LINK>) assessed the effects of patient information material that was developed with consumer consultation. One excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Angell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Angell 2003</LINK>) assessed the effects of patient information material that was developed with consumer collaboration</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> tested an information leaflet about patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Participants were patients preparing to undergo surgery the next day, with no prior experience of PCA. The intervention group received a leaflet developed by health professionals and consumers. Consumers informed the design of the leaflet as participants of focus groups. The control group received a leaflet developed by health professionals alone. The outcome measures were: patients' worries about using PCA; knowledge of PCA (classified as consumer influence on healthcare outcomes); and rating of the quality of the leaflet (classified as consumers' satisfaction with products resulting from consumer involvement). The leaflet developed following consumer consultation included more information than the leaflet developed by health professionals alone. It included information about side effects of PCA, that PCA contains morphine, that overdosing or addiction was not possible and details about how to use PCA. In addition the leaflet developed following consumer consultation had more illustrations and scored better in a readability test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> tested information material about endoscopic procedures. Participants were patients who were recruited on the day of their endoscopic examination. The intervention group received material developed by health professionals after consulting consumers. Individual interviews with consumers were used to inform the development of the material. The control group received material developed by health professionals alone. Outcome measures were patient satisfaction with the material (classified as consumers' satisfaction with products resulting from consumer involvement) and anxiety related to the endoscopic procedure (classified as consumer influence on healthcare outcomes). The authors reported that the leaflets developed following consumer consultation had improved layout and illustrations, simpler language and included more detailed practical information than the leaflet developed by professionals alone. Consumer consultation resulted in the development of three leaflets, each describing one specific endoscopic procedure, as having descriptions of three different procedures in the same leaflet (as in that developed by professionals) could confuse readers. In terms of the framework for describing consumer involvement (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) <LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> consulted consumers, each on a single occasion, face-to-face in focus groups and individual interviews respectively.</P>
<P>We excluded two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Angell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Angell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2002</LINK>); see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. These trials both compared information material prepared with consumer involvement to usual care (that is, no information material) which could not serve as fair 'no consumer involvement' comparisons. In these trials, the effects of consumer involvement could not be separated from the effects of the educational material itself.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-01-24 10:56:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Five of the six included trials were comparisons of consumer consultation versus no involvement (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> also worked collaboratively with consumers to organise these consultations. The sixth trial was a comparison of three different methods of consumer consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK>). We did not find any trials reporting any of the other comparisons described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, including involvement in decision-making, different methods of recruitment, and different ways of providing training and support.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Different communication forums for involvement in health policy</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK> compared two forms of deliberative consumer involvement (telephone discussion and a group face-to-face meeting) and a mailed survey in eliciting priorities for community health goals. Participants were members of community organisations. Due to a low response rate in the mailed survey group, Abelson and colleagues excluded this group from the analysis. There is no indication as to whether or how the consumer priorities elicited did indeed inform community health goals.</P>
<P>A statistically significant difference was found for one of seven reported health-related community strengths (an improving local economy) (P &lt; 0.05), with the proportion of people indicating this as very important to health increasing by 7% in the phone group and decreasing by 31% in the face-to-face meeting group. There were no statistically significant before and after changes in rankings of five health concerns in the telephone group. There was one statistically significant change in the face-to-face meeting group, where mental illness went from an average score of 3.62 to 3.00 on a scale from one to five, with one being the most important (P &lt; 0.05). Based on this trial there is very low quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) of telephone discussions compared with face-to-face meetings changing consumer priorities for community health goals. Both appeared to achieve more involvement than a mailed survey, based on the low response rate to the mailed survey, and both resulted in changes in the views of participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer involvement versus no consumer involvement in research</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared consumers (patients) with professionals as data collectors in patient satisfaction surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK>). They compared the data collected, to investigate if responses given to consumer interviewers differed from responses given to staff (professional) interviewers. Neither of the trials reported whether or how these data informed subsequent service development.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> found that those who were surveyed by consumer interviewers gave significantly more 'extreme negative' responses, defined as a score of zero on any question (on a scale from 0 to 4), compared to those surveyed by staff interviewers (P &lt; 0.02). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of 'extreme positive' responses, defined as a score of four on any question. Overall, participants reported high levels of satisfaction with mental health outpatient services regardless of whether the interviewer was a consumer or staff member.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> also found that participants reported high levels of satisfaction with mental health outpatient services regardless of whether the interviewer was a consumer. In this trial the average satisfaction score was a little lower in the consumer (client) interviewed group than it was in the staff interviewed group (0.16 on a scale from 1 to 4, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>When we pooled the results of these two trials, the overall difference was similar (0.14 on a scale from 0 to 4, P = 0.001), see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> asked for patients' views on satisfaction with case management services and with physicians' services. We have reported results from satisfaction with case management services only. The conclusion would not have differed if scores from satisfaction with physicians' services had been used. Based on these two trials there is low quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) of small differences in satisfaction survey results when consumer interviewers are used instead of staff interviewers. There is no evidence as to whether subsequent decisions were influenced.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK> compared an informed consent document developed with consumer input (potential trial participants) to a consent document developed by professionals (trial investigators). The primary outcome in this trial, understanding of the trial described in the consent document (parent trial), was measured by a four-item informed consent questionnaire (ICQ-4). Data were collected four times, at trial entry and at three follow-up visits. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between trial groups for understanding of the parent trial. This was the case at all four time points. Mean (95% CI) group differences ranged from +0.020 (-0.015 to 0.055) (better understanding) at entry to -0.021 (-0.054 to 0.012) (worse understanding) at three-months for the participant versus the investigator document group. In both groups level of understanding was generally high. For example, approximately one-third of participants answered that they completely understood the trial at the time when they decided to participate (highest level on a four-point scale) compared to less than 5% who said they did not understand the trial at all (lowest level on the scale). Based on this trial there is low quality evidence that consumer consultation in the development of consent documents may have little if any impact on participant&#8217;s self-reported understanding of the trial described in the consent document, satisfaction with study participation, adherence to the protocol or refusal to participate (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer involvement versus no consumer involvement in preparing patient information</HEADING>
<P>Two trials evaluated products (patient information leaflets) which were developed following consumer consultation (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>). The leaflets were compared with patient information developed without consumer consultation.</P>
<P>As the leaflets developed following consumer consultation contained more detailed information than the leaflets developed without consumers, both trials referred to previous research that suggests that giving patients sufficient health information may reduce their anxiety, and assessed anxiety (worries) as outcomes. The trials did not, however, find that patient information material developed following consumer consultation reduced worries or anxiety related to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) (<LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>) or endoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>, using a five-point Likert scale, found small differences in the proportions of patients who were worried about becoming addicted (P = 0.68), about getting too much drug (P = 0.21), or about giving themselves too much drug (P = 0.26) with PCA. Between 80% and 90% of participants were not at all or only slightly worried in both groups for all three questions evaluating worries. <LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> used a five-point Likert scale to measure anxiety, ranging from 'completely calm' to 'terrified', for various aspects of endoscopic procedures. For anxiety level, there was a small, statistically significant difference in favour of the leaflet developed with consumers (P = 0.04). Based on these two trials, there is moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>) that there may be little or no difference in worries or anxiety associated with procedures for patients receiving information material developed following consumer consultation, compared with patients receiving material developed without consumer consultation. Other outcomes reported were the quality of patient information material and patients' knowledge.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> more patients rated the information given in leaflets developed following consumer consultation as being very or extremely clear (84%), compared with patients who received leaflets which had no consumer consultation in their preparation (48%, P &lt; 0.001). Thirty per cent of those who read the leaflet developed following consumer consultation required no more information about the 'painkiller', compared with 8% of those who read the leaflet developed without consumer consultation (P = 0.002). <LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> found that patients were significantly more satisfied with leaflets developed following consumer consultation compared with leaflets developed without consumer consultation (P = 0.04).</P>
<P>Based on these two trials there is moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>) that consumer consultation prior to developing patient information material probably results in material that is more relevant, readable and understandable to patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> used six multiple choice questions about PCA to measure knowledge obtained from reading leaflets. Participants who read the leaflet developed following consumer consultation were significantly better informed. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of correct responses for five of the six questions. For example, 58% of those who read the leaflet developed following consumer consultation recognised that all the side effects listed could be caused by PCA, whereas none of those who read the leaflet developed without consumer consultation gave the correct answer (P &lt; 0.001); and 49 of those who read the leaflet developed following consumer consultation knew that morphine was used in PCA compared with seven of those who read the leaflet developed without consumer consultation (P &lt; 0.001). Information about side effects and morphine use was provided only in the leaflet developed follow ing consumer consultation. Based on this trial there is moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>) that consumer consultation before developing patient information material probably can improve the knowledge of patients who read the material.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-01-24 10:56:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>A summary of all of the included comparisons, the outcomes reported in these and the type of process (guidelines development, research, development of patient information material and health policy) is shown in a matrix (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The most striking feature of the matrix is the preponderance of empty cells, where we were unable to identify any trials despite our extensive literature searches. There was only one trial of consumer priorities for healthcare policy (but without evidence of consumer views informing policy decisions), three trials in healthcare research (again, without evidence of consumer views informing decisions about research or services), and two trials of consumer involvement in developing patient information material. We did not find any trials of consumer involvement in developing practice guidelines.</P>
<P>We found only one trial of consumers collaborating in an on-going working relationship, and no trials of consumer control. We found no trials of consumer involvement in decision making. In the trials included in this review, consumers only collected or provided data to inform decisions.</P>
<P>The evidence appears to be strongest for the benefits of consumer involvement compared with no consumer involvement in developing patient information materials (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Few conclusions can be drawn about the benefits, adverse effects or costs of consumer involvement in any of the other areas that we have considered in this review. Little can be concluded about the benefits, adverse effects and costs of different forums for communication, different degrees of involvement, different ways of recruiting consumers, different ways of providing training and support, or different degrees of financial support (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). There is also a paucity of evidence for most outcomes, including participation or response rates, decisions, healthcare outcomes, satisfaction, impacts on participating consumers, and costs.</P>
<P>None of the included trials addressed possible adverse effects of consumer involvement, such as tokenism or consumer involvement slowing the process down and making it costlier.</P>
<P>The validity of the outcomes knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>) and anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK>) is probably limited to evaluations of material providing more detailed or additional information (as a result of consumer involvement) than the control material. The impact of information on anxiety level may also depend on the topic and the setting in which the information is provided. Other important outcomes not considered in <LINK REF="STD-Aabakken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Aabakken 1997</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Chumbley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chumbley 2002</LINK> are whether consumer involvement in developing patient information material can increase the recipients' ability to participate in decision-making about their own health care, and their level of satisfaction with the healthcare decisions made after having read the material.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polowczyk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Polowczyk 1993</LINK> have methodological limitations (no information given about allocation concealment or blinding). In addition, when investigating if consumers instead of staff members should be used as interviewers in patient satisfaction surveys, it might be helpful to consider whether there are factors other than the distinction between consumer and staff that could influence the responses; for example, the personality of the interviewer, or how well the interviewer and the interviewed previously knew each other.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK> there was little or no difference in participants&#8217; self-reported understanding of the parent trial between a consent document developed with and without consumer involvement. This could be due to the two documents being quite similar, as the focus group of consumers used the investigator-developed document as a starting point for their revised document. Other reasons for similar results in the two trial groups could be that the participants (Gulf War veterans) were all trained in reading complicated documents, and that the parent trial was relatively easy to understand. It might have been helpful to measure both perceived and actual understanding in trial participants. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Guarino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Guarino 2006</LINK> did not provide information on allocation concealment and blinding, and used an unvalidated questionnaire prior to the trial.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Abelson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abelson 2003</LINK> to be very low because of methodological limitations (no information given about allocation concealment or blinding and more than 20% loss to follow-up) and a small sample (3 trial arms with a total of 46 participants).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:23:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>There is a huge gap in the evidence from randomised controlled trials about desirable and adverse effects of consumer involvement in healthcare decisions at the population level, or how to achieve effective consumer involvement.</P>
<P>We found evidence, from two trials that provide moderate quality evidence, that consumer involvement in developing patient information material probably improves the clarity of the information and the knowledge of people who read the material.</P>
<P>We found evidence, from two trials that provide low quality evidence, that using consumer interviewers instead of staff interviewers might result in small differences in satisfaction surveys.</P>
<P>We found low quality evidence from one trial that consumer involvement in the development of an informed consent document might have little or no impact on participants' perceived understanding of the trial described in the consent document.</P>
<P>There was very low quality evidence from one trial of differences in the views of participants towards priorities for community health goals when telephone discussions were used compared with face-to-face meetings to involve the public.</P>
<P>As we discussed in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>, there are good arguments for attempting to achieve effective consumer involvement. In light of the paucity of evidence we have demonstrated in this review, people making decisions about how best to involve consumers may wish to rely on advice based on practical experience and common sense, such as the principles of successful consumer involvement in NHS research (<LINK REF="REF-Telford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telford 2004</LINK>). Finally, they should consider evaluating options about which they are uncertain, in well-designed and reported randomised trials if possible.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-02 23:13:10 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of involving consumers in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material remain largely unevaluated. The six trials included in this review demonstrate that randomised controlled trials of consumer involvement are feasible. Variation in practice and uncertainty about how best to achieve effective consumer involvement suggest that there is a need for trials to reduce this uncertainty. Trials are needed to evaluate the effects of different:</P>
<UL>
<LI>methods for recruiting consumers;</LI>
<LI>degree of involvement (relationship between consumers and professionals);</LI>
<LI>forums for communication;</LI>
<LI>degrees of consumer involvement in decision-making;</LI>
<LI>ways of providing training and support; and</LI>
<LI>degrees of financial support.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Given the few randomised controlled trials identified, updates of this review will continue to have a broad focus.</P>

<P>in the protocol and the previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK>, we searched for quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series analyses, and controlled before-after studies in addition to randomised controlled trials. As we identified and included five randomised controlled trials in <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK>, we decided to search for randomised controlled trials only for the updated review.</P>

<TITLE>Cochrane EPOC Group: Quality assessment</TITLE>
<TABLE COLS="1" ROWS="1">
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Standard criteria are used to assess the methodological quality of studies included in EPOC reviews (protection against bias). Each criterion is scored as DONE, NOT CLEAR, or NOT DONE. Details regarding the application of these criteria are available from the editorial base.<BR/>Seven standard criteria are used to assess the methodological quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs):<BR/>
<BR/>1. Concealment of allocation (protection against selection bias). This is scored as DONE if the unit of allocation was by institution, team or professional and any random process was described explicitly; or if the unit of allocation was by patient or episode of care and there was some form of centralised randomisation scheme, an on-site computer system or sealed opaque envelopes were used.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Follow-up of professionals (protection against exclusion bias). This is scored as DONE if outcome measures were obtained for 80% to 100% of subjects randomised.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Follow-up of patients. This is scored as DONE if outcome measures were obtained for 80% to 100% of patients randomised, or for patients who entered the trial.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Blinded assessment of primary outcome(s) (protection against detection bias). This is scored as DONE if the authors state explicitly that the primary outcome variables were assessed blindly, or the outcome variables are objective, eg. length of hospital stay, drug levels as assessed by a standardised test. Primary outcome(s) are those variables that correspond to the primary hypothesis or question as defined by the authors. In the event that some of the primary outcome variables were assessed in a blind fashion and others were not, each is scored separately.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Baseline measurement. This is scored as DONE if performance or patient outcomes were measured prior to the intervention, and no substantial differences were present across trial groups.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Reliable primary outcome measure(s). This is scored as DONE if there were two or more raters with at least 90% agreement or kappa greater than or equal to 0.8 OR the outcome data were obtained from some automated system, eg. length of hospital stay, drug levels as assessed by a standardised test.<BR/>
<BR/>7. Protection against contamination. This is scored as DONE if allocation was by community, institution or practice and it is unlikely that the control group received the intervention.<BR/>
