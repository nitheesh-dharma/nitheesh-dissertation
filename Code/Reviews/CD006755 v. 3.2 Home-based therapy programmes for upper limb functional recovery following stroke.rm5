<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After a stroke, upper limb (arm) problems are common and recovery is often limited. This review of four studies with 166 relevant participants, looked at whether participating in home-based therapy programmes, targeted at the upper limb, could improve performance in activities of daily living (ADL), functional movement of the upper limb, performance in extended ADL and arm motor impairment. In comparison with usual care, home-based upper limb programmes had no difference in effect on any of the outcomes. In comparison with an upper limb programme based in hospital, we found home-based upper limb programmes to be no more or no less effective for arm motor impairment outcomes. The evidence in this area is limited. Further research is needed to determine the effects of home-based therapy programmes.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:52:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Trials Register (May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), AMED (1985 to May 2011) and six additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:52:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults after stroke, where the intervention was a home-based therapy programme targeted at the upper limb, compared with placebo, or no intervention or usual care. Primary outcomes were performance in activities of daily living (ADL) and functional movement of the upper limb. Secondary outcomes were performance in extended ADL and motor impairment of the arm.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-15 20:55:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook assessment of risk of bias in terms of method of randomisation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), whether all the randomised patients were accounted for in the analysis (attrition bias) and the presence of selective outcome reporting.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four studies with 166 participants. No studies compared the effects of home-based upper limb therapy programmes with placebo or no intervention. Three studies compared the effects of home-based upper limb therapy programmes with usual care. Primary outcomes: we found no statistically significant result for performance of ADL (mean difference (MD) 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.43 to 7.14) or functional movement of the upper limb (MD 2.25; 95% CI -0.24 to 4.73)). Secondary outcomes: no statistically significant results for extended ADL (MD 0.83; 95% CI -0.51 to 2.17)) or upper limb motor impairment (MD 1.46; 95% CI -0.58 to 3.51). One study compared the effects of a home-based upper limb programme with the same upper limb programme based in hospital, measuring upper limb motor impairment only; we found no statistically significant difference between groups (MD 0.60; 95% CI -8.94 to 10.14).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability throughout the world, consuming significant resources (<LINK REF="REF-Isard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isard 1992</LINK>). It is therefore imperative that stroke services are effective and efficient. Problems affecting the upper limb following stroke are often persistent and disabling, with only 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1986</LINK>) to 56% (<LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 1994</LINK>) of patients regaining useful upper limb function after three months. In addition, motor impairment has been shown to be the most influential factor in determining well-being, one year after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wyller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyller 1998</LINK>). Improving upper limb function is therefore often a core element of rehabilitation after stroke, in order to maximise patient outcomes and reduce disability (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increasingly the trend within health service delivery (including stroke care) is toward decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient care and moving care into the community, which has led to the development of home-based stroke services (<LINK REF="REF-ESDT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESDT 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane review of therapy-based rehabilitation services for stroke patients at home (<LINK REF="REF-OPT-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPT 2006</LINK>) found such services reduce the odds of a poor outcome in terms of ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and have a beneficial effect on a patient's ability to perform personal ADL and extended ADL, compared with conventional or no care. This review specifically investigated therapy service interventions primarily aiming to improve task-orientated behaviour (not upper limb interventions or outcomes) and was based on a review of heterogeneous interventions. Our review, in contrast, exclusively investigated the effects of home-based therapy programmes targeted at upper limb recovery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of specific upper limb interventions has been reviewed within other Cochrane systematic reviews: constraint-induced movement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sirtori-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirtori 2009</LINK>), electromechanical and robotic-assisted training (<LINK REF="REF-Mehrholz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehrholz 2009</LINK>), electrostimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2009</LINK>), EMG biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Woodford-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodford 2007</LINK>), hands-on therapy interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2011</LINK>), mental practice (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 2011</LINK>), repetitive task training (<LINK REF="REF-French-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2007</LINK>), simultaneous bilateral training (<LINK REF="REF-Coupar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coupar 2007</LINK>) and virtual reality training (<LINK REF="REF-Laver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laver 2011</LINK>). This review does not intend to replicate or overlap these other reviews, as the focus will be on a range of programmes of interventions completed at home rather than on a specific intervention.</P>
<P>With an increased focus on home-based stroke services, and the undertaking of programmes of interventions targeted at upper limb recovery within clinical practice, we deemed a systematic review of home-based therapy programmes for individuals with upper limb impairment following stroke, to be appropriate.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:53:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included RCTs where participants had been randomly assigned (that is, each participant had an equal chance of being allocated a particular treatment as another participant). Random allocation could have been completed by, for example, using computer-generated random numbers or random number tables. We only included the first phase of cross-over studies to exclude any carry-over or learning effects. We included RCTs with or without blinding of participants, treating therapist(s) and assessor(s). One of the intervention groups must have included an intervention group of a home-based therapy programme (see definition in <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>) and a comparison group of placebo or usual care ('conventional' or 'traditional'). We also included studies that included a home-based therapy programme in addition to usual care, compared with usual care alone. We determined usual care as defined by the original trial authors when it was considered to be a normal or usual component of stroke rehabilitation. Where appropriate, we documented the description of usual care. We only included studies if the therapist visited the patient in their own home (at least once) to prescribe treatment.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-11-22 14:27:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included trials of participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke - "a syndrome of rapidly developing symptoms and signs of focal, and at times, global, loss of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1989</LINK>) - regardless of time since onset, initial upper limb impairment, ability to follow instructions, co-morbidities, previous strokes or location of stroke. We included studies that recruited participants with other neurological disorders if more than 50% of participants were stroke patients. We only included participants living in their own homes (that is, at their permanent address). This included care homes and other forms of supported or sheltered accommodation.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:54:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included RCTs had to include one group which received a home-based therapy programme, targeted at upper limb recovery following stroke. For the purposes of this review we defined home-based therapy programmes as those:</P>
<OL>
<LI>carried out in the patient's home (that is, at their permanent address; this may include care homes and other forms of supported or sheltered accommodation);</LI>
<LI>prescribed by healthcare professionals or individuals under the supervision of healthcare professionals; and</LI>
<LI>including more than one specific intervention targeted at upper limb recovery.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The rationale for including only these RCTs with more than one specific intervention was to avoid studies of single upper limb interventions. The focus of this review is a 'programme' of therapy. A programme of therapy will always include several different treatment interventions. The effectiveness of single interventions for the upper limb is assessed in other reviews. Excluding RCTs that assess only one specific intervention effectively limited this review to RCTs of 'programmes' of interventions to reduce or avoid overlap with other reviews, and reflect clinical reality.</P>
<P>We included studies of complex packages of rehabilitation if the administered package included interventions targeted at upper limb recovery, and included the three elements outlined above.</P>
<P>We included any duration or intensity of programme and completed subgroup analyses as appropriate. Where possible we documented the professional background, training and experience of the person(s) delivering the intervention.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-03-13 21:23:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary or initial aim of upper limb interventions is usually to improve functional movement and reduce impairment. However, arguably the most important goal for patients is to improve their ability to participate in and independently achieve independence with ADL. Additionally, this is the over-arching aim of all rehabilitation interventions. Therefore, we identified two primary outcomes of interest: performance in ADL and functional movement of the upper limb.</P>
<P>We anticipated that the studies would use and report a large variety of different outcome measures relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes of this review. Therefore, for each outcome of interest (primary and secondary) we attempted to identify and list all the common, specific measurement tools or scales that could be included. If we identified a study that reported more than one measurement tool or scale which addressed the same outcome, we used the scale listed earliest in our lists. If a study did not use any of the measures in a list, but measured the outcome using a different measurement tool or scale, we included and documented this. These hierarchical lists are outlined below.</P>

<P>Two review authors (FC and PvV) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using a standard critical appraisal assessment form. Assessment of the quality of studies focused on potential areas of bias within the studies as this has been shown to affect the estimation of effectiveness of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For each included trial two review authors (FC and PvW) independently extracted information about the method of randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, whether all the randomised patients were accounted for in the analysis and the presence of selective outcome reporting. Consideration of blinding of participants and therapists led to the conclusion that blinding would not be possible in these types of trials; consequently we did not document this information. Any disagreements between the two review authors were resolved through discussion, involving a third review author (AP), if necessary.</P>

<P>For each comparison we used the study results for performance in ADL, measures of upper limb functional movement, measures of motor impairment and adverse effects, if documented. We presented all outcome measures analysed as continuous data and thus we entered, where available, means and standard deviations (SDs). If the studies used the same outcome measures, we calculated a pooled estimate of the mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If different outcome measures were used within the same outcome category (for example, one study used Action Research Arm Test and another study used the Frenchay Arm Test to measure functional movement of the upper limb), we used standardised mean difference (SMD) instead of MD. We used The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software, RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>), for all analyses.<BR/>

<P>Our searches of the electronic bibliographic databases identified 1773 records after removal of duplicates (107 from the Cochrane Trials Register, 1247 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and CINAHL, 52 from CENTRAL, 121 from OT seeker, 78 from PEDro and 168 from REHABADATA database). After elimination of obviously irrelevant studies and further duplicates we were left with 446 potential papers. Two independent review authors (FC and PvV or AP) obtained the abstracts for these papers and assessed them for inclusion. We then assessed these abstracts for further review at full paper. Where disagreement arose, the review authors reached consensus through discussion and/or sought the opinion of a third review author (PvV or AP). From this process we obtained full papers of 57 studies. Of these 57 full papers (relating to 56 studies), we excluded 49 papers (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for further details).

The four trials were completed by two different research groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK> were completed by one research group. Both of these studies were RCTs, which compared a home therapy programme with usual care, and recruited individuals from the Kansas City Stroke Study registry. It is assumed that <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK> (20 participants ) was a pilot study, undertaken prior to the larger <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK> study (100 participants). Both studies included an exercise programme that was designed to improve strength, balance and endurance, and to encourage more use of the affected extremity. This intervention met the inclusion criteria as it was explicitly stated that the programme was targeted at upper limb recovery after stroke, the intervention was carried out in the patients' homes, was prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist and clearly involved more than one specific intervention targeted at upper limb recovery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK> were completed by one research group. Both of these studies were RCTs, which compared virtual reality plus telerehabilitation at home with either virtual reality training in hospital with a therapist present (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK>), or conventional therapy in the local health district (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>). Both studies aimed to improve motor impairment in the upper limb.</P>
<P>Disagreement occurred between review authors as to whether virtual reality telerehabilitation training should be considered as a single intervention or a therapy programme. The intervention described in the studies of virtual reality and telerehabilitation training (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>) consisted of different virtual tasks, comprising a number of arm movements, plus knowledge of results feedback and therapist instructions via teleconferencing (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>). The intervention combined virtual reality training and telemedicine. In <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK> the intervention designed to be tested within the RCT was the teleconferencing itself; however, the consequence of this design was a study which compared virtual reality arm training at home versus virtual reality arm training in hospital. In <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK> virtual reality arm training delivered at home using teleconferencing was compared with conventional or 'standard' care. As the review authors could not reach consensus on whether the virtual reality intervention was a single intervention or a therapy programme, we took a majority decision and included virtual reality training as a therapy programme. We would welcome feedback on this decision, and will reconsider it for future updates of this review.</P>

This exercise programme was compared with usual care as prescribed by their physicians. The remaining two studies delivered a virtual reality intervention with telerehabilitation. This was compared with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>) or the same therapy delivered with a therapist present (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK>).

Details can be found in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Several studies aimed to compare modes of service delivery, such as domiciliary versus hospital-based care (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BCST-1991" TYPE="STUDY">BCST 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bjorkdhal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorkdhal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Domino-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Domino 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbertson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbertson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roderick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roderick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rudd 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 2000</LINK>). These studies delivered general rehabilitation rather than being specifically targeted to the upper limb. If we could not find a specific aim to target upper limb, we excluded these studies.</P>
<P>We considered the full paper of one excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Baskett-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baskett 1999</LINK>) in detail. There was initially disagreement between review authors regarding whether or not the intervention in this study met the inclusion criteria. This study investigated a home-based programme of individually prescribed exercises and activities. We have had no response from our attempts to contact the authors of this study. Discussion between three review authors (FC, PvV and AP) led to consensus that there was insufficient information available within the published paper to definitively conclude that the programme did meet the criteria of including "more than one specific intervention targeted at upper limb recovery". However, all review authors did acknowledge that this assessment was based on a lack of information, rather than on definitive information, suggesting that the programme did not meet the review criteria. This study has been excluded and is detailed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. If we obtain further information relating to the home-based programme evaluated in this trial, we will reconsider including the study in future updates of this review.</P>

These studies help to determine whether home-based intervention of one type improved upper limb function and impairment compared to home intervention of another type. This was not the purpose of this particular review and, therefore, we excluded this type of study.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-29 20:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine if home therapy programmes were more or less effective than usual care (visits to hospital or local health centre or hospital inpatient care), no intervention or a placebo intervention. Only four studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. These four studies included essentially two different programmes of therapy and so are not representative of all the therapies available.</P>
<P>The initial level of impairment of participants in the included studies was mild to moderate as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale. We found no studies on the effectiveness of home therapy programmes for participants with more severely affected upper limbs.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of interest was the effect of the programme on ADL, as the most important goal for patients is to improve their ability to participate in and independently achieve independence with ADL. However, the initial aim of upper limb interventions is to improve functional movement and reduce impairment, which is expected to lead to more independence in ADL. Therefore, we also included improvement in functional movement as a primary outcome of interest, and we included upper limb motor impairment as a secondary outcome. All studies used the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale as a measure of motor impairment and so it was possible to combine results for this outcome in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK> however, did not include measures of ADL, functional movement of the upper limb or extended ADL, so the findings for these measures are based on the <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK> studies. Overall there was a lack of evidence concerning primary outcomes.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:56:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no studies that compared home therapy programmes with placebo or no intervention, three studies which compared home therapy programmes with usual care, and one study which compared the same therapy programme delivered in either the home or hospital.</P>
<P>In summary, this review has identified:</P>
<UL>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:56:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is currently insufficient to answer the review questions: the effects of home therapy programmes compared with placebo, no intervention, usual care or the same therapy in hospital in terms of performance in ADL, functional movement of the upper limb, performance in extended ADL, motor impairment of the upper limb and adverse events. We only included four studies in the review and two of these had a small number of participants. This limits the completeness of the evidence relevant to this review.</P>
<P>All of the studies focused on individuals with mild to moderate stroke deficits and included other inclusion criteria relating to exclusion of other serious medical conditions or cognitive impairment interfering with comprehension. Therefore, the results of this review may not be generalised to the wider population of stroke patients.</P>
<P>It should be noted that disagreement occurred between review authors as to whether virtual reality telerehabilitation training should be considered as a single intervention or a therapy programme. A majority decision was taken to categorise virtual reality telerehabilitation training as a therapy programme, and this decision will be revisited in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>The lack of sufficient high quality evidence makes it inappropriate to draw conclusions from the results regarding the applicability of home therapy programmes within the context of current practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-29 20:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence in this review comes from only four studies with a total number of 166 participants. The lack of evidence makes it impossible to draw any robust conclusions. Again it must be highlighted that the evidence in this review also comes only from two research groups. The heterogeneity between the groups in terms of types of home therapy programmes completed also limits the conclusions that can be drawn.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Identification of relevant studies</HEADING>
<P>Within the protocol we attempted to create a clear and unambiguous definition of home-based therapy programmes targeted at the upper limb, in order to select studies relevant to our research question. However, the review authors encountered a number of difficulties in reaching consensus over the inclusion or exclusion of specific studies. There were a limited number of studies reporting on specific home-based therapy programmes targeted at the upper limb. Many of the studies were service evaluations, which may have included elements of upper limb interventions. However, it was unclear what, if any, interventions were targeted at the upper limb. General lack of information about interventions made it difficult to decide on whether to include some studies. Considerations of home-based therapy versus other forms of service delivery have been covered in other reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-OPT-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPT 2006</LINK>) and therefore, we did not include them in this review. In addition,we were only interested in studies that clearly had a programme of interventions targeted at the upper limb.</P>
<P>We experienced particular difficulties in reaching a decision about the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>. The review authors could not reach consensus, and the majority decision was taken. This difficulty related to disagreement over whether virtual reality training comprised of more than one treatment component or not. We also experienced difficulties reaching consensus on the exclusion of studies in terms of which part of the intervention had been delivered at home (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>). These difficulties suggest that the definition was not sufficiently clear and should be reconsidered prior to future updates.</P>
<P>We did not identify any studies comparing the effects of a home therapy programme with placebo or no intervention. Arguably, placebo interventions and no intervention are very different comparison interventions and ought to be considered separately. Therefore, for future versions of this review, if there are studies with either placebo or no intervention comparison groups, we will consider using separate comparisons for home therapy versus placebo and home therapy versus no intervention.</P>
<P>Whilst our research question has clear clinical relevance and focus, it is possible that our attempt to apply rigorous and clearly defined criteria to the interventions studied may have inadvertently restricted the selection of relevant studies. Consequently, it may be that the focus of this review is too narrow, and further updates may need to consider the remit of the review in order to be of clinical benefit.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-12-12 09:56:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Through a thorough searching process we are confident that we should have identified all relevant published studies. However, it must be acknowledged that there is a small possibility that there are additional studies (published and unpublished) that we did not identify, particularly as we did not complete handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings that had not been searched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration. By missing relevant studies, this potentially could have introduced bias into the review.</P>
<P>The diversity of the training carried out at home, and the variations in reporting between studies, led to the review team making some subjective decisions, particularly about the trials to include (see sections above) which may have introduced bias. The studies within this area are heterogenous in terms of what can be classified as home therapy programmes targeted at the upper limb and there were a number of complex strands which required discussion among the review authors and consensus decisions being made. We appreciate that this could be perceived as a limitation of our review.</P>
<P>We used hierarchical lists (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) to select which outcome measure should be included (if a study reported a number of different relevant outcome measures). There could potentially be biases in the hierarchical order developed for each outcome. However, we carefully considered the order of the hierarchy and reached consensus. Despite the potential limitations and biases of this approach, we believe that because of the large number of different outcome measures used to assess similar domains, the pre-stating of a hierarchical list provides substantial advantages in comparison to the alternative option of having to make subjective decisions about the selection of outcome measures after data collection has been completed.</P>
<P>For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2008</LINK>) SDs were not reported and we imputed the SD from another paper (<LINK REF="STD-Piron-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Piron 2009</LINK>) (by the same research group which included similar patients). Further, we calculated SDs from reported standard error (SE) (SD = SE &#8730;n) with regard to another study (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK>). This may have introduced some bias into the review process. However, we believe that including imputed and estimated data from these studies is preferable to excluding the data.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence in this review to provide implications for practice.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for primary research</HEADING>
<P>In order to be able to achieve the objective of this review- to determine the effects of home-based therapy programmes for upper limb recovery in patients with upper limb impairment following stroke, compared with (1) placebo or no intervention; (2) usual care; and (3) same treatment in hospital- further research is required. High quality RCTs are needed which aim to test a therapy programme specifically targeted at the upper limb, in the home, and where participants are visited by health professionals at home. It is also desirable that future studies are explicit about the types of home therapy programmes provided, and that an increased number of types of home therapy programmes are investigated. Trials of adequate size and quality are required, not only to assess the clinical effectiveness of home-based therapy programmes for upper limb recovery but also to assess the cost benefit of undertaking such interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Implications for secondary research</HEADING>
<P>We believe that the question we sought to answer within this review has high clinical relevance. However, we encountered a number of problems during the review process relating to our definitions of home-based therapy programmes. These definitions and the scope of this review should be appropriately considered prior to any further updates.</P>

<U>Group 1</U> (50 participants): usual care. This involved services as prescribed by their physicians. Reserach staff visited every 2 weeks for health education, vital signs and a test of oxygen saturation. 46% of participants in this group did not receive any postacute rehabilitation services. Two-thirds were provided with an unsupervised exercise programme. Those who did receive therapy received an average of 8.7 &#8723; 5.3 physical therapy visits and 10.4 &#8723; 7 occupational therapy visits. Physical and occupational therapy were received separately, as prescribed by participants' physicians. Duration of combined physical therapy and occupational therapy visits comparable to those in intervention group (approximately 90 minutes). There was much variation in the types of exercises received</P>
<P>
<U>Group 2</U> (50 participants): home therapy programme. This involved an exercise programme designed to improve strength, balance and endurance and to encourage more use of the affected extremity. Exercise sessions were divided into the following 4 blocks</P>
<OL>
<LI> Assistive and resistive exercises using PNF patterns or theraband exercise (elastic bands of varying elasticity used as a means to provide resistance) and functional exercises in which body weight was used for resistance, all directed at both upper and lower extremity</LI>
<LI>15 minutes of balance exercises, which were progressively ordered by difficulty</LI>
<LI>Use of the affected upper extremity in functional activities</LI>
<LI>Progressive walking programme, progressive exercise on a bicycle ergometer</LI>
</OL>
<P>Physical and occupational therapists supervised the programme, at participants home and included 36 sessions of 90-minute duration over 12 to 14 weeks. No other therapy was provided unless participants required speech therapy, provided by usual care providers. There were structured protocols for the exercise tasks, criteria for progression and guidelines for reintroducing therapy after intercurrent illness</P>
<P>Each participant received an average of 33.4 &#8723; 2.3 visits, and the average duration of a visit was 91 &#8723; 4.5 minutes</P>
<P>For both groups, treating therapists completed a treatment log to capture type of exercises and frequency and duration of therapy visits</P>

<U>Group 1</U>: conventional physiotherapy in the local health district. Participants performed specific exercises for the upper limb with a strategy of progressive complexity. First, they were requested to control isolated motions without postural control, then postural control was included, and finally complex motions with postural control were practiced. Examples of tasks were to touch different targets arranged in front, manipulate different objects, follow trajectories displayed on a plane and to recognise different arm positions</P>
<P>
<U>Group 2</U>: telerehabilitation system at home. This consisted of 2 dedicated personal computer-based workstations; 1 at the participants home; and 1 at the hospital. This generated a virtual environment in which participants executed motor tasks. This was combined with video-conferencing which permitted the remote control of the participants video camera mobility in order to observe the participants movements during the rehabilitation tasks. The virtual reality system incorporated a 3D motion tracking system to record arm movements. 5 virtual tasks comprising simple arm movements were practised whilst participants watched their movement trajectory on screen compared to an ideal trajectory. Participants received verbal feedback from the therapist about the exactness of the movements</P>

<P>For 2 of the outcomes (Extended ADL and ADL) another paper (<LINK REF="REF-Studenski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Studenski 2005</LINK>) was used. For the primary analysis (end of intervention) drop-outs were n = 6/50 and 2/50 for the intervention and control groups respectively. To account for possible missing value bias, multiple imputation was performed. This was judged to be at low risk of bias. For ADL and extended ADL outcomes at follow-up drop-outs n = 10 for both groups, which raises the possible risk of bias for these outcomes<BR/>
