<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-01 13:49:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may be used for patients with type 2 diabetes. They delay the absorbance of carbohydrates ('complex form of sugar') in the gut. In this review we present data from meta-analyses that show (among other things) a decrease in glycated haemoglobin, fasting and post-load blood glucose and post-load insulin. But we found no evidence for an effect on mortality or morbidity. We found clues that with higher dosages the effect on glycated haemoglobin, in contrast to post-load blood glucose, remains the same. This might be because a lower compliance due to increasing side-effects.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-01 14:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose or miglitol, have the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The true value of these agents, especially in relation to diabetes related mortality and morbidity, has never been investigated in a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-11-01 14:48:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>To assess the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-01 13:47:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, reference lists of reviews on the topic of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and we contacted experts and manufacturers for additional trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks duration comparing alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with any other intervention and that included at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycemic control, lipids, insulin levels, body weight, adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers read all abstracts, assessed quality and extracted data independently. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by the judgement of a third reviewer. A statistician checked all extracted data entrance in the database. We attempted to contact all authors for data clarification.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 41 trials (8130 participants), 30 investigated acarbose, seven miglitol, one trial voglibose and three trials compared different alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Study duration was 24 weeks in most cases and only two studies lasted amply longer than one year. We found only few data on mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Acarbose had a clear effect on glycemic control compared to placebo: glycated haemoglobin -0.8% (95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.7), fasting blood glucose -1.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -1.4 to -0.9), post-load blood glucose -2.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.9). The effect on glycated haemoglobin by acarbose was not dose-dependent. We found a decreasing effect on post-load insulin and no clinically relevant effects on lipids or body weight. Adverse effects were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin and dose dependent. Compared to sulphonylurea, acarbose decreased fasting and post-load insulin levels by -24.8 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -43.3 to -6.3) and -133.2 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -184.5 to -81.8) respectively and acarbose caused more adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It remains unclear whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors influence mortality or morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conversely, they have a significant effect on glycemic control and insulin levels, but no statistically significant effect on lipids and body weight. These effects are less sure when alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are used for a longer duration. Acarbose dosages higher than 50 mg TID offer no additional effect on glycated hemoglobin but more adverse effects instead. Compared to sulphonylurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors lower fasting and post-load insulin levels and have an inferior profile regarding glycemic control and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:11:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:51:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. As a result there is a disturbance of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' of the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups', 'Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:11:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Currently, four alpha-glucosidase inhibitors exist: acarbose, miglitol, voglibose and emiglitate. Of these, acarbose is by far the most prescribed drug. In most guidelines it is not a drug of first choice but used as an addition to other drugs for type 2 diabetes when treatment goals are not met, or in case of contra-indications for other medications (<LINK REF="REF-EDPG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten 2000</LINK>). The price of acarbose and miglitol is approximately $72 per month for 100 mg tablets, three times daily.<BR/>Because of its lowering effect on the postprandial elevation of insulin levels, a beneficial effect on body weight is to be expected. Further, a positive effect on hypertriglyceridaemia has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Reaven-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaven 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have been put in a new light as a result of a study on the efficacy of acarbose in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (<LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiasson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiasson 2003</LINK>). This study showed that acarbose could prevent or delay the development of IGT into type 2 diabetes. Moreover, it showed a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in the acarbose treated group, but the conclusions of this study are heavily debated (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiser 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Abdominal discomfort like flatulence, diarrhoea and stomachache are the most frequently occurring adverse effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Because of their specific working mechanism hypoglycaemic adverse events do not occur. They do not increase insulin output potentially leading to hypoglycaemia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Existing evidence</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>Some reviews have been published recently on the topic of acarbose (<LINK REF="REF-Breuer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laube-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laube 2002</LINK>) and miglitol (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>), these reviews were not performed systematically with respect to one or more of the following items: literature search, inclusion criteria of studies and quality assessment. In none of these reviews a meta-analysis was performed.<BR/>A recent meta-analysis of seven trials with acarbose in the treatment of type 2 diabetes suggested a significant decrease in the occurrence of myocardial infarction (Hazard ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) (<LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 2004</LINK>). However, we do not support the conclusions of this meta-analysis because the study was subject to publication bias, heterogeneity, detection bias and confounding (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2004b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">RCTs</HEADING>
<P>Several randomised clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors as monotherapy or as a combination with other agents have been published. Most of these evaluated the efficacy of acarbose. One major trial reported a decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 0.6% when acarbose was given as sole therapy and compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another large (n = 1946) randomised clinical trial, performed within the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), investigated acarbose versus placebo given in addition to diet, (combined) oral antidiabetic medication or insulin therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Holman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 1999</LINK>). At the three-years endpoint, 39% of the patients in the acarbose group and 58% in the placebo group were still taking the study medication. The intention-to-treat analysis showed, that compared with placebo during three years, acarbose lowered glycated haemoglobin by 0.2% (P = 0.003). When only the proportion of patients that continued to take the study medication was considered, this difference was 0.5%. The clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear, especially when considering that even in the per-protocol analysis for most patients using acarbose glycated haemoglobin remained higher than 8.0%. Further, data on other important outcomes like morbidity and mortality are not available from this study. Adverse effects<B> </B>were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin (flatulence, stomachache) and were reported to resolve after a short while.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:56:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are reversible inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme present in the brush border of the small intestine. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delay absorption of complex carbohydrates and thus inhibit postprandial glucose peaks thereby leading to decreased postprandial insulin levels.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 12:53:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The scope of the current review was to assess the value of monotherapy with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus with respect to patient-oriented outcomes such as morbidity, mortality and quality of life. Further we investigated the value of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with respect to parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism, body weight and adverse events. We sought studies that compared alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with placebo or any other intervention. In the future, the review will be regularly updated to include relevant new trials.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors primarily on mortality, morbidity and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and secondly, the effects on parameters representing glucose and lipid metabolism (that is glycated haemoglobin, glucose, insulin and cholesterol).</P>

<P>Two reviewers (FVDL and PL) independently checked the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment when the information given suggested that the study: 1) included patients with diabetes mellitus, 2) compared alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with placebo or any other active intervention, 3) assessed one or more relevant predefined clinical outcome measure, 4) used random allocation to the comparison groups. In case of any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, the full article was retrieved for clarification. Interrater agreement for study selection was measured using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). Differences in opinion were resolved by a third party (EVDL) and when resolving the disagreement was not possible, the article was added to those 'awaiting assessment' and the authors were contacted for clarification. If the authors provided no clarification, the review group editorial base was consulted.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-11-01 14:50:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Two reviewers extracted data on intervention and outcomes independently, using a pre-tested data extraction form that was adapted from a standard form provided by the review group. The data extraction form included the following items:</P>
<UL>
<LI>general information: author, type of publication (including the existence of duplicate or multiple publications), year of publication, language, country were the study was conducted, setting (general practice, hospital or outpatient / rural, city, developed / developing world / single or multi-centre), the stated aim of the study published, sponsor(s), ethics approval;</LI>

<BR/>When more than one publication was available from a study, all articles were abstracted and scores separately and the collected data was synthesized. In case of contradictorily findings, the author was contacted for clarification.<BR/>Differences in data extraction were resolved by consensus, referring back to the original article. If necessary, information was sought from the authors of the original studies.<BR/>If necessary, data were also extracted from graphical figures: two reviewers (FVDL and PL) calculated the data independently and if both outcomes were not similar, a third reviewer (EVDL) recalculated the data.

<P>The two reviewers assessed each trial independently. Possible disagreement was resolved with consensus, or with consultation of a third reviewer (EVDL) in case of disagreement. In particular, the following quality criteria were assessed:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of selection bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Randomisation procedure: the randomisation procedures were scored adequate if the resulting sequences were unpredictable (that is computer generated schemes, tables of random numbers, coin tossing).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: allocation concealment was scored adequate if participating patients and investigators could not foresee the assignment (that is by central randomisation remote from trial site, sequentially numbered and sealed radio-opaque envelopes).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of performance bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Method of blinding: blinding was considered adequate if the two (or more) interventions were similar in size, colour and shape or when a double-dummy method was applied. Because of the sometimes-obvious adverse effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, true blinding was difficult. For trials that reported blinding of patients for medications, we also investigated whether blinding was checked; for example by asking patient and investigator afterwards about the medication they suspected to be supplied.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of attrition bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Handling of drop-outs: handling of drop-outs was considered adequate if studies gave a complete description of all patients failing to participate until the end of the trial and if the data were analysed on intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, that means with all randomised patients included.</LI>
<LI>Quantity of dropouts: overall dropout rate less than 15% was considered adequate.</LI>
<LI>Selective dropout: a difference in dropout rate the in main treatment groups less than 10% was considered adequate.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minimisation of detection bias</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Method of blinding outcome-assessment: this item was considered less relevant for studies with laboratory data or death as main outcomes or if the (blinded) investigator was also outcome assessor. If applicable, outcome assessment was considered adequate if the outcome assessors were completely blind for the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis (see under 'sensitivity analyses').</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories adapted from the Cochrane Handbook criteria (see Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A - All quality criteria met (1. adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, 2. adequate blinding, 3. adequate ITT analysis and/or both drop-out rate less than 15% and selective drop-out less than 10%): low risk of bias.<BR/>B - One or more quality criteria only partially met (1. adequate randomisation or adequate allocation concealment, 2. mentioning of blinding but exact method unclear, 3. inadequate/unclear ITT analysis but drop-out less than 15% or selective drop-out less than 10%): moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - One or more quality criteria not met (1. inadequate randomisation and allocation concealment, 2. inadequate or no blinding, 3. inadequate ITT and drop-out rate equal to or more than 15% and selective drop-out equal to or more than 10%): high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This adapted classification was also used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Data were summarised statistically if available and of sufficient quality. The table of comparison was first divided in all possible comparisons (that is acarbose versus placebo / voglibose versus sulphonylurea), then sub-divided into all possible outcomes (that is death, glycated haemoglobin adverse events) and finally, within the outcomes sub-groups were made for the different dosages. Outcomes were calculated per sub-group and for all sub-groups together.<BR/>
<BR/>Dichotomous data were expressed as odds ratios (OR), but in some cases the relative risk (RR) was also calculated in addition to the OR since its interpretation is easier, especially if the outcome was a negative event, for example death. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and we converted the RD into the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) taking into account the time of follow-up.</P>
<P>Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) and an overall WMD was calculated. The actual measure of effect of all continuous variables were the differences from baseline to endpoint. The standard deviations of these differences were essential for the data to be included in the meta-analysis. When the standard deviation (SD) of the difference was not reported we first asked the authors to provide these data. If the SDs were not provided we estimated the SD of the difference with the following formula:</P>
<P>SDpaireddifference = ??(SD1)2 + (SD2)2 - 2 x r x SD1 x SD2].</P>
<P>SDpaireddifference = standard deviation of the difference (pre- / post-treatment)<BR/>SD1 = Standard deviation of the pre-treatment value, SD2 = Standard deviation of the post-treatment value, r = correlation coefficient. We used a conservative correlation coefficient of 0.4.</P>
<P>Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model. Heterogeneity was statistically tested by using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance set at P &lt; 0.10. Possible sources of heterogeneity were assessed by subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses as described below. Small study bias was tested for using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1992</LINK>). Quantification of the effect of heterogeneity will be assessed by means of I squared, ranging from 0-100% including its 95% confidence interval (Higgins 2002). I squared demonstrates the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity and will be used to judge the consistency of evidence.</P>
<P>The analyses were done with the computer program RevMan Analyses 1.0.2 in Review Manager 4.2.3 (2003, The Cochrane Collaboration).</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-11-01 14:14:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Significant main outcome measures were explored by subgroup analyses in order to explore differences in effect as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>glycated haemoglobin level at baseline (subdividing into three groups: less than 7%, 7 to 9%, more than 9%);</LI>
<LI>age (based on mean age of total randomised group);</LI>
<LI>gender (subdivided in two groups, based on data: less than 45% female, equal or more than 45% female);</LI>
<LI>body mass index (BMI) (Normal: male less than 27, female less than 25; overweight: male 27 to 30, female 25 to 30; obese: more than 30);</LI>
<LI>different kind of diets or exercise schedules used;</LI>
<LI>duration of intervention (less than 24 weeks, 24 weeks, more than 24 weeks);</LI>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-11-01 14:14:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The sensitivity of the analysis for a number of factors was determined by comparing the results of the meta-analysis for studies with and without certain characteristics. Data from a minimum of five studies had to be available for both groups to be considered. The following factors were investigated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comparing published and unpublished studies;</LI>
<LI>comparing studies with and without (or with unknown) quality characteristics: adequate randomisation, adequate allocation concealment, adequate method of blinding, adequate ITT analyses. Further, comparing studies with an overall drop-out rate equal to or more than 15% and less than 15%, difference of drop-out rates less than 10% and equal to or more than 10% between the main treatment groups. In addition, the overall score for quality based on the adapted Cochrane criteria was used so that studies with score A and B were compared with studies with C;</LI>
<LI>repeating the analysis excluding trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other or no sponsoring) or country;</LI>
<LI>repeating the analyses using different measures of effect size (relative risk, risk difference) and different statistical models (fixed and random effects models);</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Meta-regression analyses</HEADING>
<P>We used meta-regression analyses (in SAS proc MIXED, version 8.0) to explore the influence of characteristics of study population and study design on the outcomes. We studied the dependent variables glycated haemoglobin, fasting and post-load glucose, fasting and post-load insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and adverse effects. The independent variables were similar to the pre-defined sub-groups (baseline glycated haemoglobin, age, gender, baseline BMI, and duration of treatment). In addition we studied duration of diabetes at baseline, the use of a fixed dose and the use of a step-up dosage regimen. The weight of each trial was equal to the inverse sum of the within trial variance and the residual between trial variance, in order to perform a random effects analysis. To gain sufficient power, data from at least 10 studies had to be available to calculate results from the meta-regression.</P>

<P>* CENTRAL: 262 records were retrieved and assessed on the basis of title and/or abstract (Issue 3 2003), 59 records were initially included. Ten records were excluded after the full article had been read. So 49 records were finally included in the review.<BR/>* MEDLINE: 328 records found (April 2003), 43 records initially included, 34 records finally included in the review.<BR/>* Embase: 567 records found (April 2003), 50 records initially included, 40 records finally included in the review.<BR/>* Current Contents (December 2003): 260 records found, 27 records initially included, 23 records finally included in the review.<BR/>* LILACS: 13 records found, one records initially but excluded after further scrutiny.</P>
<P>Experts: We obtained 14 references as a result of correspondence with experts: seven references after a general mailing to 27 experts with a request for additional references (six out of 27 forms were returned), and another seven references as a result of contacts which we established searching for missing or additional data. Two references were already in our possession (one study performed by our group but that was not published at that time (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Laar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Laar 2004a</LINK>) and an article referring to two trials (<LINK REF="REF-F_x00f6_lsch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fölsch 1990</LINK>, using data from <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spengler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Spengler 1992</LINK>).<BR/>We included nine (out of these 16) references in the final review.</P>
<P>Manufacturers: Bayer, the developer of acarbose and miglitol, sent us 23 references, 17 were initially included and 16 were finally included in the review. The developer and patent holder of voglibose (Takeda) and the patent holders of miglitol (Pfizer and Sanofi-Synthelabo) did not reply to our letters.</P>
<P>Handsearch: 22 possibly eligible references were found by handsearching (checking references of existing reviews, browsing on the internet, posters on congresses etc.). Seventeen references were initially included, of which 14 references were finally included in the review.</P>
<P>Databases of ongoing trials (see table Characteristics of ongoing trials): in addition three studies were identified as ongoing studies in trial registers. All attempts to retrieve reports or data from these studies, failed so far.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Missing data</HEADING>
<P>Because none of the articles contained all the study data we required for the quality assessment and meta-analyses, we attempted to contact all corresponding authors. For one study we could not retrieve contact information (<LINK REF="STD-Hillebrand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hillebrand 1987</LINK>). For 22 out of 41 studies we received additional data about design, quality and/or outcomes. For 12 studies the authors delegated the reply to representatives of Bayer Germany, USA or Italy because the data-files were kept by this firm. Studies for which we received additional data are indicated in the table 'Characteristics of included studies' and the reference list (published and unpublished data).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measurement of post-load blood glucose, insulin and c-peptide</HEADING>
<P>There are several methods to determine the patients' response to a glucose load. The 'load' may consist of simple glucose (like in an oral Glucose Tolerance Test, oGTT), a standardised or ad libitum meal, or a standardised portion of carbohydrates. Studies may also differ in the time-interval used for the test and if the study drug was given prior to the test. We assessed all those differences and described them in a table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Most studies used some form of test-meal with carbohydrates, except for two studies which used an OGTT (<LINK REF="STD-Hotta-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Laar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Laar 2004a</LINK>). In two studies the type of test was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Hillebrand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hillebrand 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rybka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rybka 1999</LINK>).<BR/>For two studies, the only post-load measurement was at a 2-hours interval (<LINK REF="STD-Hotta-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hotta 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pagano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pagano 1995</LINK>) and six studies reported both one and two hour values (<LINK REF="STD-Chiasson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chiasson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawamori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santeusanio-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Santeusanio 1993</LINK>), all other studies that measured post-load values for glucose, insulin and/or C-peptide used an 1-hour interval. Therefore, we chose to report the 1-hour values for post-load glucose, insulin and C-peptide, and to use the 2-hour outcomes if 1-hour data were not available. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis with the opposite method: using the 2-hour values, and the 1-hour values for studies that did not report 2-hour measurements.</P>

Thirty-three studies were double-blinded, five studies were not blinded and three studies with three treatment groups were not blinded with respect to one treatment arm (metformin and glibenclamide).<BR/>Nineteen studies compared acarbose with placebo, four of which compared two or more doses with placebo. Eleven studies compared acarbose with other anti-diabetic medication and in most cases also with placebo. Miglitol was studied in comparison with placebo in three studies, one of which with four different dosages. In four studies miglitol was compared with other anti-diabetic medication (and placebo eventually). Two three-arm studies compared acarbose with miglitol and placebo (one study) or glibenclamide (one study). One study compared miglitol and voglibose (and placebo) and one trial studied voglibose versus diet and glyburide (a sulphonylurea). We found no studies with emiglitate.<BR/>Study duration was 24 weeks (21 studies), 16 weeks (seven studies), one year (four studies), 12 weeks (four studies), three years (two studies), 30 weeks, 36 weeks or 56 weeks (all one study).<BR/>Two studies reported data on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1998</LINK>) and one crossover study reported that no patients had died (<LINK REF="STD-Gentile-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gentile 1999</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Missing data</HEADING>
<P>In a number of cases it was reported that certain outcomes (that is fasting blood glucose, triglycerides) were investigated, but the results were not or insufficiently reported (that is standard deviations missing). This was especially striking for a study with acarbose, that was of long duration and with a large number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). Data from this trial could not be used because the main outcome measure was the time until patients with good control on diet alone needed additional medication. Data from a large study of long duration investigating miglitol could not be used as no measures of variance were reported for the main outcomes (that are standard deviations) (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1998</LINK>).

The outcome for the subgroup actually receiving acarbose monotherapy was not reported.<BR/>One 56-weeks study that compared 25 mg and 50 mg TID miglitol with glyburide and placebo, reported the number of cardiovascular events in the table of adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1998</LINK>). The percentage of occurrence of any cardiovascular event was 19%, 17%, 22% and 29% for miglitol 25 mg TID, miglitol 50 mg TID, placebo and glyburide respectively.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Glycated haemoglobin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>alpha-glucosidase inhibitors had a clear beneficial effect on glycemic control compared to placebo. Glycated haemoglobin was considered the primary measurement in most studies. The results of the meta-analysis for overall effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor on glycated haemoglobin compared to placebo was -0.8% (95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.6, 28 comparisons) for acarbose and -0.7% (95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.4, seven comparisons) for miglitol. For voglibose, data from only one comparison were available: -0.5% (95% confidence interval -0.6 to -0.3). We did not see a clear dose dependency of the effect on glycated haemoglobin with respect to acarbose. Effect sizes for the subgroups for dosage 25 mg (n = 1 study), 50 mg (n = 2), 100 mg (n = 17), 200 mg (n = 4) and 300 mg (n = 2) TID were -0.5%, -0.9%, -0.8%, -0.8% and -0.8% respectively.<BR/>For miglitol, there seemed to be a dose dependent effect on glycated haemoglobin, but data from only seven comparisons, of which four originating from the same multi-arm study (<LINK REF="STD-Drent-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Drent 2002</LINK>), were available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fasting and post-load blood glucose, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>We also found a beneficial effect on fasting blood glucose for acarbose compared to placebo in a meta-analysis with 28 comparisons: -1.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -1.4 to -0.8). For miglitol and voglibose two and one comparisons were available in the meta-analysis with fasting blood glucose as outcome. These analyses resulted in a mean decrease in fasting blood glucose of -0.5 mmol/L (miglitol, 95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.2) and -0.6 mmol/L (voglibose, 95% confidence interval -1.0 to -0.2).<BR/>The influence on (1-hour) post-load blood glucose was more profound. Overall effect on post-load blood glucose was -2.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.9, 22 comparisons). The sub-groups for dosage showed a dose dependent pattern. For miglitol and voglibose only very limited data were available: miglitol -2.7 mmol/L 95% confidence interval -5.5 to 0.1, two comparisons), voglibose -2.4 mmol/L (95% -3.0 to -1.8, one comparison).<BR/>In contrast to the effect on glycated haemoglobin, the forest plots for the comparison acarbose versus placebo and the outcome fasting and post-load blood glucose suggested a dose dependency of the treatment effect.<BR/>Because not all studies used similar methods for the measurement of post-load blood glucose we repeated the analyses replacing 1-hour post-load data by 2-hour values (if available). We found no differences in that analysis compared with the meta-analysis in which we primarily used the 1-hour values.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors versus other medication</HEADING>
<P>Studies that compared an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor with other interventions than placebo were scarce. Pooling of results was only possible for the comparison acarbose with sulphonylurea, as data from eight comparisons were available. For other comparisons, pooling was not possible because of lack of studies (metformin and nateglinide, both one study). The overall comparison acarbose versus sulphonylureas yielded a non-significant trend for sulphonylureas with respect to glycated haemoglobin (0.4%, 95% confidence interval -0.0 to 0.8). The results in the subgroup 'Acarbose 100 mg TID versus Glibenclamide 3.5 mg TID' were not consistent with the other comparisons (overall test for heterogeneity p &lt; 0.00001). Leaving the entire sub-group out of the analysis would give an overall effect of 0.6% (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.0) in favour of sulphonylurea with a non-significant chi-square test for heterogeneity (p = 0.15). In the comparison acarbose versus sulphonylurea one study seemed to be an outlier (<LINK REF="STD-Kovacevic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kovacevic 1997</LINK>), but the results of that study were again in line with the comparisons with other sulphonylurea. For most comparisons acarbose versus sulphonylurea, acarbose was given as a fixed dose and the sulphonylurea individually adjusted, mostly sub-maximal.<BR/>The result for fasting blood glucose showed a similar pattern: superiority for sulphonylurea except for the subgroup 'Acarbose 100 mg TID vs. Glibenclamide 3.5 mg TID'. Overall effect 0.7 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2) in favour of sulphonylurea. Without the deviating sub-group: 1.2 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.8) in favour of sulphonylurea.<BR/>The outcome post-load blood glucose yielded no statistically significant differences between acarbose and sulphonylurea.</P>

Similarly fasting blood glucose decreased by 0.7 mmol/L, 1.1 mmol/L, 1.7 mmol/L and 0.1 mmol/L and one hour post-load blood glucose decreased by 2.4 mmol/L, 3.2 mmol/L, 1.8 mmol/L and 0.0 mmol/L respectively.<BR/>One study with 603 participants and of 24 weeks duration (<LINK REF="STD-Rybka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rybka 1999</LINK>) reported a placebo subtracted decrease of glycated haemoglobin of 0.4%, 0.5% and 0.4% respectively for miglitol 50 mg TID, miglitol 100 mg TID and acarbose 100 mg TID.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fasting and post-load insulin and C-peptide</HEADING>
<P>The 25 studies that assessed pancreatic function mostly used insulin levels for this purpose. We found that acarbose had no statistically significant effect on fasting insulin levels compared to placebo and a non-statistically significant decreasing effect on post-load insulin levels (fasting insulin: -1 pmol/L (15 comparisons, 95% confidence interval -8 to 7), post-load insulin: -41 pmol/L (13 comparisons, 95% confidence interval -61 to -19)). For miglitol and voglibose only a limited number of comparisons were available and no statistically significant differences were found.<BR/>Compared to sulphonylurea, acarbose had a statistically significant decreasing effect on fasting insulin (seven comparisons, -25 pmol/L, 95% confidence interval -43 to -6) and post-load insulin as well (seven comparisons, -133 pmol/L, 95% confidence interval -185 to -82). Only one study compared miglitol with a sulphonylurea and found an opposite result: fasting insulin 28 pmol/L increase compared to sulphonylurea (<LINK REF="STD-Pagano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pagano 1995</LINK>). Post-load insulin was not measured in that study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Body weight and body mass index (BMI)</HEADING>
<P>Compared to placebo, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors had minimal effects on body weight. There were no statistically significant differences for body weight in the meta-analysis for acarbose versus placebo, but BMI decreased slightly in favour of acarbose: -0.2 kg/m2 (13 comparisons, 95% confidence interval -0.3 to -0.1).<BR/>The reported advantage for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on body weight compared to sulphonylurea could not be confirmed: no significant differences were found.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Most studies reported the total number of adverse events and although it became clear from most reports that by far the most adverse effects were of gastro-intestinal origin, the number of patients with gastro-intestinal adverse effects were rarely reported exactly.<BR/>Compared to placebo, patients treated with acarbose reported significantly more adverse effects: OR 3.4 (or relative risk 1.4) (23 comparisons, 95% confidence interval 3.4 to 4.4). There was a dose dependent increase in adverse effects in the range 25 mg TID to 200 mg TID. When the sub-group for studies that applied a fixed dosage scheme (in contrast to studies with an individually titrated dose) was considered, the dose dependency was more clear: ORs for adverse events were 1.6, 2.9, 4.1, 7.0 and 8.3 for the dosages 25, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mg TID respectively. Most studies reported that the adverse events mainly consisted of gastro-intestinal symptoms. The meta-analysis on gastro-intestinal adverse events yielded a similar result: OR 3.30 (or relative risk 1.8) (four comparisons, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7). The comparison miglitol versus placebo resulted in similar figures: all adverse events OR 4.0 (seven comparisons, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 9.5).<BR/>Compared to sulphonylurea, patients treated with acarbose had more adverse effects: OR 4.0 (seven comparisons, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 7.8). Only two studies provided data for the comparison miglitol versus sulphonylurea: OR 1.3 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.4).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:08:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>In this systematic review, we found no statistically significant effect for an effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on mortality, morbidity and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared to placebo, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce glycated hemoglobin (0.8% acarbose, 0.7% miglitol), fasting and postprandial blood glucose (acarbose: fasting glucose 1.1 mmol/L, post-load blood glucose 2.3 mmol/L) and post-load insulin. We found no clinically relevant effects on plasma lipids and body weight. We found no dose dependency for the effect on glycated haemoglobin for acarbose. alpha-glucosidase inhibitors caused significant more adverse effects, especially of gastro-intestinal origin. It should be noted that the data of the largest and longest studies could not be used for meta-analyses. Compared to sulphonylurea alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were inferior with respect to glycemic control and adverse effects, the extent of this effect differed with the sulphonylurea used. On the contrary, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors had a decreasing effect on fasting and post-load insulin levels compared to sulphonylurea. Of the three alpha-glucosidase inhibitors investigated, acarbose, miglitol and voglibose, most data and best outcomes were obtained for acarbose.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The results from this review are relevant for physicians dealing with patients with type 2 diabetes and for the developers of treatment guidelines. Data of beneficial effects on mortality or complications from diabetes mellitus are not available at the moment. Alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors inhibit post-pranidal glucose peaks thereby leading to decreased post-load insulin levels. Further, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors lower post-load insulin levels, especially when compared to sulphonylurea. There are no additional advantages with respect to the lipid profile or body weight. Most evidence is available for acarbose, which has also the best results for most outcomes. The importance of these findings and the exact place of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has to be judged in view of other evidence regarding the clinical importance of (post-load) hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia.<BR/>This review investigated alpha-glucosidase inhibitors as monotherapy. Although, from a theoretical point of view, it seems logical that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors offer similar potentials in addition to other antidiabetic therapies, this cannot be concluded from this review. Evidence for the possible efficacy for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors as add-on therapy might be derived from a systematic review that is currently going on (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:09:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This is the first high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. It offers an up-to-date and most complete overview of all randomised trials concerning alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy, because it is the result of an extensive search, including grey literature and unpublished studies. In addition, maximum efforts have been done to minimise missing or incomplete data by attempting to contact all authors. This has been successful in 22 out of 41 cases.<BR/>Although we included a high number of studies, the data are remarkably consistent and heterogeneity is limited. Statistical tests for heterogeneity are less reliable when a high number of studies are involved and further scrutiny by sub-group analysis and meta-regression analysis yielded few possible sources for heterogeneity. The use of a fixed dose (instead of an individually titrated dosage) may cause a more profound effect with respect to glycemic control but causes also more adverse effects. The same applies to giving the full dose at once, instead of using a step-up scheme.<BR/>Although this review presents a possibly confusing amount of data and figures, we feel that completeness is one of the strengths of a Cochrane systematic review. The way we presented these data, subdivided in types of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, controls and outcome measures, makes it possible for the reader to find whatever specific piece of information on alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy he or she needs.<BR/>This review will be regularly updated, leaving the possibility open to add information or to correct possible errors. In fact, this is a plea for anyone who is aware of such additional data or errors in the data presented here, to report this to the authors.</P>
<P>Our main research question was not answered with the trials we included in this review so far. Only few studies reported data on morbidity and mortality on a reliable and consistent way. It is not likely that in the (near) future a randomised trial of long enough duration will be conducted with acarbose monotherapy to investigate mortality and morbidity. This raises the question whether our review, with its strict inclusion criteria and high demands for outcome data, overshoots the mark. Maybe with broader inclusion criteria, that is inclusion of (high quality) observational studies, we would have gained data to study a possible influence on mortality and morbidity. The use of observational data does not necessarily lead to biased outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Concato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concato 2000</LINK>). Still, we feel that for the evaluation of medical interventions, well designed randomised trials are the first choice. To improve systematic reviews in the future, we strongly plea for the integration of outcome measures such as death or morbidity into all trials that evaluate medical interventions for patients with chronic diseases. Even if the trial is underpowered for that outcome, the data might always be of value for a meta-analysis. The question of including observational studies in a future update of this review is still open to us.<BR/>Despite an exhaustive and thorough search, including requests to experts and manufacturers, we still cannot rule out publication bias. For the three trials that we found in a database for ongoing trials, we were not able to reveal outcome data or additional information about the design despite the fact that one trial ended six years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Whitby-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 1998</LINK>) and the others in 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Holman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sa_x002d_adu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sa-adu 2003</LINK>). Another clue for possible publication bias was that we, despite maximum efforts to retrieve unpublished data, discovered three previously unpublished studies coincidentally (<LINK REF="STD-Bayer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bayer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bayer-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Bayer 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>) that were used for a study on a congress poster (<LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 2003</LINK>). Altogether, we still think that the overall risk for publication bias is limited because the funnel plots do not point at small study bias and because of the exhaustive search. Still, we welcome unpublished data for future updates.<BR/>Not all papers reported outcomes in a way that could contribute to meta-analyses. This problem was partially solved by asking authors for additional data, imputing the standard deviation of the mean difference (see under methods, data analysis) or using data from graphical figures. As an example, data from only four of the 32 studies investigating glycated haemoglobin in relation to the use of acarbose, suited for use in the meta-analysis directly; for twelve studies additional data had to be obtained from the authors to complete all blanks; for twelve studies we had to calculate the SD of the mean difference from the baseline and endpoint SDs and for four studies the data could not be used at all. Unfortunately, one of those four studies was of long duration (3 years) and had a high number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). In summary, we used the most precise data in about half of the cases (16 out of 32) and we had to use less precise figures in 12 out of 32 cases. Because we used a conservative correlation coefficient of 0.4, this will most probably have made the confidence interval larger. The influence of the missing data from the largest studies was discussed under 'existing literature'.<BR/>Only nine out of the 41 studies lasted longer than 24 weeks, and only two studies were amply longer than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Holman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). For one of those two studies data could not be included in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). The importance of long-term studies is evident, especially for a chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes. In the subgroup analysed for study duration, we found clues that the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors decrease with time, This was mostly due to the UKPDS study un which a decrease of only 0.2% was found after three years of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Holman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 1999</LINK>). Therefore, we feel that the results from our study should be interpreted with caution when applied to the long-term treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors of patients with type 2 diabetes.<BR/>Research funded by pharmaceutical companies is more likely to produce results favouring the tested drug; this is often due to inappropriate comparators or small study bias (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>). In this review at least 33 studies were sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, including one study in which the sponsor was the producer of the comparison drug (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2001</LINK>). We suppose that this will cause a slight overestimation of the results, especially concerning the studies that compare alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with other medication. In fact, this is probable in the comparison acarbose versus sulphonylurea (glycated haemoglobin) where acarbose is dosed in a fixed way and the comparison drugs are individually adjusted (<LINK REF="STD-Coniff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coniff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovacevic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kovacevic 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salman 2001</LINK>) or very low dosed (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 1997</LINK>). In one study both treatment arms used an individually adjusted dosage scheme (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Laar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Laar 2004a</LINK>). For the comparison with placebo the influence of this 'bias by sponsoring' is less sure as it would be similar to publication bias like we discussed before.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:10:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Although this is the first systematic review concerning alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy, some reviews have been published recently about acarbose (<LINK REF="REF-Breuer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laube-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laube 2002</LINK>) or miglitol (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>). The quality of those reviews is limited: selection criteria for the studies were insufficiently specified and there was no mention of the criteria used to assess the validity of individual trials. Further, these reviews did not present explicit methods on data extraction, assessment of heterogeneity or subgroup analyses. Both reviews on acarbose referred also to a 'meta-analysis' of older date (<LINK REF="REF-Lebovitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebovitz 1998</LINK>), which calculated the mean outcomes on glycemic control for 13 studies, using outcomes for single treatment arms (baseline minus endpoint) as well as placebo extracted outcomes in a non-transparent way.<BR/>Our results are roughly in line with the previous reviews with respect to the overall effect on glycemic control compared to placebo, but there are relevant differences and additional findings. First, we found no dose-dependency of acarbose on glycated haemoglobin in the meta-analysis. Remarkably, the effect on fasting and post-load blood glucose appeared to be dose dependent. This discrepancy might be explained by a better compliance of patients that were using the lower dosages, because higher dosages induce more adverse effects. Prior to their visit to the study centre, it is more likely that patients took their study medication and thus achieving good fasting and post-load glucose values. Only for glycated haemoglobin, the effect of low compliance will show up. Secondly, we could not find relevant effects on lipid levels, especially triglycerides. Thirdly, we also could not confirm the optimistic view on adverse effects reported in the previous reviews. Twenty out of 41 included studies were subject to a skewed drop-out pattern (? 10% difference per treatment group) and 25 studies had a total drop-out rate that was ? 15%, in most cases this was caused by adverse effects. Finally, the previous reviews are optimistic about the glucose lowering capacities of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors compared to other agents such as sulphonylurea. We confirm a clear beneficial effect with respect to fasting and post-load insulin levels. But overall, the effects on glycemic control are inferior to sulphonylurea. For glycated haemoglobin this is not statistically significant, but most studies that compare acarbose with sulphonylurea use inappropriate comparators (that is too low dose for sulphonylurea or using an individually titrated dosage versus a fixed dosage). Therefore, we feel that a conclusion that sulphonylurea have superior glucose lowering properties, is justified. In addition, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors cause more adverse effects.<BR/>The three-years trial performed within the UKPDS (<LINK REF="STD-Holman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 1999</LINK>) was one of the main studies included in the review. The effects regarding glycated hemoglobin obtained in this trial alone (a decrease of 0.2%) are considerably less profound than those from the meta-analysis. This discrepancy with the results from the meta-analysis, point in the direction of a possible overestimation of the effect in the long (three years) term.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In patients with type 2 diabetes, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy inhibit post-prandial glucose peaks thereby leading to decreased post-load insulin levels. There are no advantages with respect to lipid metabolism or body weight. Compared to sulphonylurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have less favourable effects with respect to glycemic control and adverse effects but they lower fasting and post-load insulin levels compared to sulphonylurea.<BR/>For all outcomes, the largest evidence base exists for acarbose.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>New studies that investigate alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on proxy indicators such as glycaemic control, lipids, insulin, body weight would be redundant. Large randomised controlled trials of long duration that investigate mortality, morbidity and quality of life as primary endpoints are necessary. In addition studies comparing alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with other glucose lowering agents (especially metformin and thiazilodines) are of use. When these trials are not available, inclusion of well-designed observational studies in this review may be considered.</P>
