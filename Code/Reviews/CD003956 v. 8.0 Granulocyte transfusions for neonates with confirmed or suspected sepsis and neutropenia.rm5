<P>More evidence is needed on the effects of granulocyte infusions for babies with sepsis and neutropenia (decreased number of white blood cells). Sepsis is an infection of the blood, caused by bacteria or fungi reaching the bloodstream. It is often fatal when it occurs in newborn babies, especially those born preterm (before 37 weeks). Preterm babies are not yet able to adequately form granulocytes, which are a key part of the immune system's ability to fight infections. Some babies with sepsis, therefore, develop neutropenia (decrease in white blood cells), which makes them more vulnerable. Granulocytes can be infused. However, the review found that there are not enough trials to show the potential benefits or harms of this treatment for newborn babies with sepsis and neutropenia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:39:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonates have immature granulopoiesis, which frequently results in neutropenia after sepsis. Neutropaenic septic neonates have a higher mortality than non-neutropenic septic neonates. Therefore, granulocyte transfusion to septic neutropenic neonates may improve outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:39:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to determine the effect of granulocyte or buffy coat transfusions as adjuncts to antibiotics, after confirmed or suspected sepsis in neutropenic neonates, on all-cause mortality during hospital stay and neurological outcome at &#8805; year of age. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of granulocyte transfusions on length of hospital stay in survivors to discharge, adverse effects and immunologic outcomes at &#8805; year of age.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-07 17:18:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials were eligible for inclusion. Forty-four infants with sepsis and neutropenia were randomised in three trials to granulocyte transfusions or placebo/no transfusion. In another trial, 35 infants with sepsis and neutropenia on antibiotics were randomised to granulocyte transfusion or IVIG.</P>
<P>When granulocyte transfusion was compared with placebo or no transfusion, there was no significant difference in 'all-cause mortality' (three trials; typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.86; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.21).</P>
<P>When granulocyte transfusion was compared with intravenous immunoglobulin (one trial), there was a reduction in 'all-cause mortality' of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.04; RD -0.34, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.09; NNT 2.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.1).</P>
<P>Pulmonary complications were the only adverse effect reported in the trials that used buffy coat transfusions.

<P>Currently, there is inconclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the routine use of granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic, septic neonates.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:43:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal infection (sepsis) is common and has been reported to affect 6.6 babies per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1995</LINK>). It is one of the major causes of neonatal mortality. The incidence of sepsis is inversely related to birthweight and gestational age. In very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates (birth weight less than 1500 grams), the incidence of culture proven, early onset sepsis (sepsis in the first 72 hrs) is approximately 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996a</LINK>). Of these babies with confirmed infection approximately a quarter will die. In this same group of babies, the incidence of late-onset sepsis (sepsis after the first 72 hrs) ranges from 16 to 25% with a mortality between 17 and 21% (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanaroff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanaroff 1998</LINK>). The rates of early and late onset sepsis have been increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Mehr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehr 2002</LINK>) and acute mortality from sepsis has remained high at 15% for the last two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 1990</LINK>). In the United States and Australia, Group B streptococcal infection accounts for approximately one third to one half of early onset infections (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 1995</LINK>) and coagulase negative staphylococcal infection for approximately one half of late onset infections (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996b</LINK>). The pattern of organisms causing early onset sepsis is changing as a result of use of antibiotics in mothers to prevent group B streptococcal infection. A predominance of gram negative organisms, especially E. coli, has been observed in VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). Sepsis has also been implicated in the development of cerebral palsy both in preterm and term infants. Neonatal sepsis in preterm infants increases the risk of cerebral palsy fourfold (<LINK REF="REF-Wheater-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheater 2000</LINK>), and exposure to maternal infection during labour increases the risk of cerebral palsy nine fold in infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Grether-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grether 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of sepsis is based on clinical parameters, positive microbiological cultures or both. Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment for neonatal sepsis, but antibiotic resistance is an emerging global problem (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1998</LINK>). As a consequence, newer adjuncts to antibiotics have been sought to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with neonatal sepsis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:43:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Granulocyte transfusions in septic and neutropenic neonates may be a useful strategy to reduce mortality and improve neurological outcome. Granulocytes are prepared in a concentrated form for transfusion to reduce the volume of the transfusion. Granulocyte concentrates are prepared by leukophoresis or by centrifugation of whole blood (buffy coats). Buffy coats for transfusion are easier to prepare but contain a lower dose of granulocytes. They have been shown to be less effective in reducing mortality than granulocyte concentrates prepared by leukopheresis in infected neutropenic adults (<LINK REF="REF-Reiss-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiss 1982</LINK>). In a non-randomised study of 20 newborns with blood-culture proven sepsis, the majority of whom had antibiotic resistant Klebsiella infection, there was a significant reduction in mortality in the group who were transfused with granulocytes compared with those who were not (mortality 10% versus 72%). This effect was more pronounced in VLBW neonates (mortality 10% versus 91%) (<LINK REF="REF-Laurenti-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurenti 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 1996</LINK> reported a meta-analysis of trials of granulocyte transfusions in adults and neonates. All trials published between 1970 to 1994, that were in English and had a control group were included. Randomisation was not a selection criterion. Results were analysed using the random effects method. When controlled trials in neonates were analysed, granulocyte transfusion did not significantly reduce mortality. However, not all participants in these trials were randomised and some trials included non-randomised infants. This review includes only randomised trials published after 1994. In adult trials, granulocyte transfusions significantly reduced mortality in the following situations; low survival rate of controls (survival rate &lt; 40%), transfusion of adequate dose of granulocytes (more than 10 to the power 10 granulocytes) and when compatibility of granulocytes was assessed prior to the transfusion. This information may be useful in assessing the efficacy and safety of granulocyte transfusions in specific neonatal subgroups (e.g. neonates with gram-negative sepsis or fungal sepsis who have a lower survival rate, neonates who had an adequate dose of granulocytes of more than or equal to 10 to the power 9 cells/kg, among others).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-07 17:18:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The immaturity of the immune system, especially humoral and phagocytic immunity, predisposes neonates to an increased incidence of sepsis caused by bacteria and fungi. Neonatal neutrophils exhibit both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities. Neutropaenia, defined as a neutrophil count below the lower range of normal, is commonly found in small for gestational age (SGA) neonates and commonly noted as a consequence of sepsis. Neutrophil kinetics in septic newborn animals have been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-al_x002d_Mulla-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">al-Mulla 1995</LINK>). When newborn animals are inoculated with a non-lethal dose of bacteria, neutrophilia occurs after a latent period of three to five hours associated with a reduction in bone marrow storage pool of neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-al_x002d_Mulla-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">al-Mulla 1995</LINK>). However, in contrast to adult animals after similar inoculations, no increase in neutrophil production is observed (<LINK REF="REF-al_x002d_Mulla-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">al-Mulla 1995</LINK>). Newborn animals inoculated with a lethal dose of bacteria occasionally develop a transient neutrophilia after a latent period of three to five hours, but usually develop a rapid neutropenia that precedes death and is accompanied by an exhaustion of bone marrow neutrophil reserves and no increase in neutrophil production (<LINK REF="REF-al_x002d_Mulla-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">al-Mulla 1995</LINK>). Septic neonates who are neutropenic have a higher mortality than non-neutropenic neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Rodwell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodwell 1993</LINK>). Neonates also have an immaturity of neutrophil function and production. Immaturity of granulopoiesis in preterm neonates is manifest by a low neutrophil cell mass, a reduced capacity for increasing progenitor cell proliferation and frequent occurrence of neutropenia in response to sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000</LINK>).There may be reduced ability of neonatal neutrophils in signal transduction, cell surface receptor up regulation, mobility, cytoskeletal rigidity, microfilament contraction, oxygen metabolism and intracellular oxidant mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preparation of granulocyte concentrates can be time consuming, taking several hours, and their availability soon after the diagnosis of sepsis could be an important factor determining efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity. The potential complications of leukocyte transfusions in neonates may be fluid overload, transmission of blood-borne infection, graft versus host disease (GVHD) from mature lymphocytes in the transfusion, pulmonary complications secondary to leukocyte aggregation and sequestration, and sensitisation to donor erythrocyte and leukocyte antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1991</LINK>). Presence of preformed anti-leukocyte antibodies in the recipient has been shown to be associated with reduced half-life of transfused granulocytes (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 1986</LINK>). Leukocyte alloantibodies may also play a role in febrile and pulmonary transfusion reactions (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 1983</LINK>). However, these antibodies may have less relevance in infants, as infants do not easily produce alloantibodies against blood cell antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Floss-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floss 1985</LINK>). Long-term immunological follow-up (6 to 23 months) for humoral, cell-mediated and phagocytic immunity in infants who received granulocyte transfusions in the first three weeks after birth for neonatal sepsis has not shown any adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Stegagno-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stegagno 1985</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:44:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The availability of more effective antibiotics, recombinant hematopoetic growth factors to counter neutropenia, the risk of transmission of infection and the necessity for appropriate technology are some of the factors that have dampened the initial enthusiasm and promise of granulocyte transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Chanock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanock 1996</LINK>). However, with the availability of recombinant hematopoetic growth factors, harvesting granulocytes from donors in relatively large quantities is feasible and these granulocytes may have a longer half-life (<LINK REF="REF-Engelfriet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelfriet 2000</LINK>). These technological advances in harvesting granulocytes and reducing the risk for transmission of infection have rekindled interest in granulocyte transfusions in neutropenic patients, especially in patients with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Sachs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachs 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigull-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigull 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigull-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigull 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cesaro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cesaro 2003</LINK>). The following systematic review will evaluate the role of granulocyte transfusions as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of neutropenic septic newborns, and will attempt to clarify the effect of granulocyte transfusions in specific situations.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-07 17:23:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standardized review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) were used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. An assessment of the quality of the included studies was done by the two reviewers independently using the standard criteria developed by the CNRG.<BR/>The reviewers independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>We completed the Risk of Bias table addressing the following methodological issues: </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); unclear risk. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, of changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); unclear risk. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:  </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants; </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel; </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed the methods as: low risk; high risk; unclear risk.</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study we described how we examined the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: low risk; high risk; unclear risk.</P>

<P>The statistical analyses were performed according to the recommendations of the CNRG. Planned analyses were undertaken for the subgroups defined under the 'Criteria for considering studies for the review'. All randomised infants were analysed irrespective of whether or not they survived to receive their allocated treatment in full, or for some other reason were not able to complete their allocated treatment (intention to treat). The treatment effects in the individual trials were analysed. The statistical package RevMan provided by the Cochrane Collaboration was used. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) (and number needed to treat (NNT) where appropriate) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for dichotomous outcomes. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean difference (WMD). The 95% Confidence interval (CI) was reported on all estimates.</P>

<P>There was a reduction in all-cause mortality during hospital stay in septic infants receiving granulocyte transfusion compared to intravenous immunoglobulin (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.04; RD -0.36, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.11; NNT 2.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. No adverse effects due to granulocyte transfusion were observed in this trial.</P>
<P>No other outcomes of interest were reported. Subgroup analyses were not possible because of lack of relevant data.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-07 17:22:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The four trials which were eligible for inclusion in this review included a small number of randomised infants. There were considerable differences between trials in the methodology, preparation of granulocytes, dose administered, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, and severity of sepsis.</P>
<P>This review found no significant difference in 'all-cause mortality during hospital stay' in infants with sepsis and neutropenia who received granulocyte transfusions when compared with placebo or no granulocyte transfusion. There was a reduction in all-cause mortality during hospital stay, of borderline statistical significance, when granulocyte transfusions were compared to intravenous immunoglobulin.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were based on very few trials with a small number of infants and no conclusions can be drawn from these.</P>
<P>Granulocyte concentrates used for transfusion have potential adverse effects, including pulmonary complications, transmission of infections, fluid overload and graft versus host disease. The most common adverse effect reported in these trials was pulmonary complications when buffy coat transfusions were used. There were no adverse effects reported in the trials which used granulocyte transfusions prepared by leukophoresis; however, the numbers of infants included in these trials are small and there have been no direct randomised comparisons between granulocytes prepared by the different methods.</P>
<P>Preparation of granulocytes for transfusion needs technical expertise and this is not universally available. There will be substantial cost implications, even in centres where it is available, there may be a delay in the procurement and transfusion of granulocytes after a decision to transfuse has been made. This delay in the transfusion of granulocytes in neonates with sepsis with neutropenia may potentially make these transfusions less effective.</P>
<P>Correction of neutrophil storage pool deficiency in the bone marrow is achievable through colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF and GM-CSF. They may be more easily available and appear to have relatively fewer side effects when compared with granulocyte transfusions. GM-CSF stimulates IFN-gamma production by mononuclear cells, which may correct functional defects of neonatal neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000</LINK>). The role of G-CSF and GM-CSF in the treatment and prevention of neonatal sepsis has been recently reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>G-CSF and GM-CSF have been used to harvest granulocytes much more easily from normal healthy donors, thereby making it easier to transfuse larger doses of granulocytes. This practice has not been used in neonatal trials. In a prospective non-randomised study in children who had severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) due to haematological disorders or malignancy, transfusion of cross-matched granulocytes from donors treated with G-CSF was found to safe and effective in clearing bacterial and or fungal sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Sachs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachs 2006</LINK>). Improvement in survival and safety of G-CSF mobilized granulocyte transfusion has been reported in retrospective case series in neutropenic children with hematological disorder or malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Grigull-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigull 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigull-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigull 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cesaro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cesaro 2003</LINK>). G-CSF and GM-CSF require sufficient progenitor cells in the bone marrow to act on and there is a latent period after which neutrophils begin to rise peripherally in the blood after G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy. Adults receiving intensive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may lack enough progenitor cells in the bone marrow and may have a severe neutropenic phase predisposing them to severe infections. Granulocyte transfusions may have a role in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1997</LINK>) before colony stimulating factors can increase the neutrophil count. The clinical situation is different in neonates where there are progenitor cells in the bone marrow. However, neonates are unable to increase proliferation; hence, colony stimulating factors appear promising.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:48:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there is inconclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the routine use of granulocyte transfusions in neonates with sepsis and neutropenia to reduce neonatal mortality or morbidity. Granulocyte concentrates for transfusion need technical expertise for preparation and are not universally available. Granulocyte transfusions also have potentially serious side effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-04 09:48:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers should be encouraged to conduct adequately powered multicentre trials of granulocyte transfusions to clarify their role in neonates with sepsis and neutropenia. Meanwhile, other adjuncts to antibiotics to improve host defence mechanisms and reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity such as colony stimulating factors, IVIG and pentoxifylline should be tested. Researchers should determine short-term outcomes including mortality and length of hospital stay in survivors as well as long-term neurological and immunological outcomes. Ideally, the design of these trials should include cost-effectiveness evaluations.</P>
