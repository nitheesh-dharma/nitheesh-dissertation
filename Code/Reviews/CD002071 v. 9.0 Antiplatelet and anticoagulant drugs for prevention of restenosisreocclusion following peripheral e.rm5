<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:49:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease of leg arteries can progressively cause leg pain on walking, pain at rest, ulcers and gangrene because of reduced blood flow. An inflatable balloon catheter inserted into the artery is used to widen and unblock the affected artery (termed angioplasty) yet reoccurrence of narrowing (restenosis) or obstruction (reocclusion) frequently occurs because of platelet clumping (aggregation) and activated blood clotting in the damaged blood vessel. This review of 22 randomised clinical trials, with a combined total of 3529 patients, set out to determine if any drug was more effective than another in preventing occlusion or restenosis of the artery after the blood vessels have been surgically widened. For the majority of comparisons, only one study was available. Evidence suggests that some drugs which reduce platelet aggregation, such as higher-dose aspirin, can reduce the rate of reocclusion six months after surgery, but evidence on associated side effects and for longer-term restenosis rates is scarce. There is also some evidence of variation in effect according to different drugs, with reocclusion/restenosis rates lower in people taking cilostazol compared with ticlopidine 12 months after surgery and, in patients with more severe disease, those taking low molecular weight heparin in addition to aspirin compared with aspirin alone. Batroxobin plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone may be an effective treatment in diabetic patients. However, available trials are generally small and of variable quality and side effects of drugs are not consistently addressed. Further good quality, large-scale randomised controlled trials, grouped by severity of disease, are required.</P>

<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is frequently treated by balloon angioplasty. Restenosis/reocclusion of the dilated segments occurs often, depending on length of occlusion, lower leg outflow, stage of disease and presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:45:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Participants were patients with symptomatic PAD treated by endovascular revascularisation of the pelvic or femoropopliteal arteries. Interventions were anticoagulant, antiplatelet or other vasoactive drug therapy compared with no treatment, placebo or any other vasoactive drug. Clinical endpoints were reocclusion, restenosis, amputation, death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding and other side effects, such as minor bleeding, puncture site bleeding, gastrointestinal side effects and haematoma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:46:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently extracted and assessed details of the number of randomised patients, treatment, study design, patient characteristics and risk of bias. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat data. To examine the effects of outcomes such as reocclusion, restenosis, amputation and major bleeding, we computed odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two trials with a total of 3529 patients are included (14 in the original review and a further eight in this update). For the majority of comparisons, only one trial was available so results were rarely combined in meta-analyses. Individual trials were generally small and risk of bias was often unclear due to limitations in reporting. Three trials reported on drug versus placebo/control; results were consistently available for a maximum follow-up of only six months. At six months post intervention, a statistically significant reduction in reocclusion was found for high-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) combined with dipyridamole (DIP) (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84), but not for low-dose ASA combined with DIP (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.10; P = 0.12) nor in major amputations for lipo-ecraprost (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.80). The remaining trials compared different drugs; results were more consistently available for a longer period of 12 months. At 12 months post intervention, no statistically significant difference in reocclusion/restenosis was detected for any of the following comparisons: high-dose ASA versus low-dose ASA (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48; P = 0.91), ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.06; P = 0.08), clopidogrel and aspirin versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) plus warfarin (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.68; P = 0.18), suloctidil versus VKA: reocclusion (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.76; P = 0.34), restenosis (OR 1.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 5.31; P = 0.24) and ticlopidine versus VKA (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.36; P = 0.30). Treatment with cilostazol resulted in statistically significantly fewer reocclusions than ticlopidine (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.76; P = 0.01). Compared with aspirin alone, LMWH plus aspirin significantly decreased occlusion/restenosis (by up to 85%) in patients with critical limb ischaemia (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; P = 0.0003) but not in patients with intermittent claudication (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.08; P = 0.06) and batroxobin plus aspirin reduced restenosis in diabetic patients (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60). Data on bleeding and other potential gastrointestinal side effects were not consistently reported, although there was some evidence that high-dose ASA increased gastrointestinal side effects compared with low-dose ASA, that clopidogrel and aspirin resulted in fewer major bleeding episodes compared with LMWH plus warfarin, and that abciximab resulted in more severe bleeding episodes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:48:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence suggesting that restenosis/reocclusion at six months following peripheral endovascular treatment is reduced by use of antiplatelet drugs compared with placebo/control, but associated information on bleeding and gastrointestinal side effects is lacking. There is also some evidence of variation in effect according to different drugs with cilostazol reducing reocclusion/restenosis at 12 months compared with ticlopidine and both LMWH and batroxobin combined with aspirin appearing beneficial compared with aspirin alone. However, available trials are generally small and of variable quality and side effects of drugs are not consistently addressed. Further good quality, large-scale RCTs, stratified by severity of disease, are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:51:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) leads to ischaemic pain on walking (intermittent claudication, i.e. muscular pain due to a lack of blood supply) or, if more severe, to rest pain and gangrene (necrotic tissue, mostly at the toes). Based on the severity of symptoms the stages of the disease are defined as Fontaine stages I to IV (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>), where stage I is asymptomatic, stage IIa is the occurrence of intermittent claudication after a pain-free walking distance of more than 200 metres, stage IIb is intermittent claudication after less than 200 metres, stage III is rest pain and stage IV is the presence of ischaemic ulcers. An alternative classification of PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 2001</LINK>) is also used, with stages II and III representing moderate and severe claudication respectively, stage IV is ischaemic pain at rest and stages V and VI are minor tissue loss (non-healing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischaemia) and major tissue loss (extending above transmetatarsal level, functional foot no longer salvageable) respectively.</P>
<P>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a well established endovascular procedure for lower limb atherosclerosis. First invented by Dotter and Judkins (<LINK REF="REF-Dotter-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dotter 1964</LINK>) and technically improved by Grüntzig (<LINK REF="REF-Gr_x00fc_ntzig-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grüntzig 1974</LINK>), the method is used in the treatment of obstructed arteries of the lower limbs, and as a modified procedure of the upper limbs, coronary, carotid, mesenteric and renal arteries. In PTA, an arterial obstruction is treated either by dilatation of a stenosis (i.e. a narrowing of the vessel diameter) or recanalisation of a total vessel occlusion, using a wire-guided inflatable balloon catheter. For treatment of the lower limbs, usually the femoral artery in the groin is cannulated and a deflated balloon catheter is inserted and pushed forward along the guide-wire to the sites of obstruction. The method can be combined with local thrombolysis (LTL) and percutaneous transluminal thromboembolectomy (PTEE) (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zehnder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zehnder 2000</LINK>) in cases of acute-on-chronic disease or embolic occlusions.</P>
<P>In cases complicated by major endothelial damage, so-called arterial dissection, or non-satisfactory dilatation with relevant residual stenosis, a wall stent may be implanted to reduce the risk of reocclusion. Stent walls are mainly applied at the aortic bifurcation or iliac segments, whereas the femoropopliteal level until recently was associated with a higher risk for reocclusion due to smaller vessel diameters in distal arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Do-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Do 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmaz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmaz 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strecker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strecker 1988</LINK>). However, with the recent new generation of stents including nitinol and drug-eluting stents, outcomes at the femoropopliteal levels have clearly improved (<LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mewissen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mewissen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabeti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabeti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vogel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogel 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Peripheral catheter interventions are relatively minor procedures performed under local anaesthesia allowing early and full mobilisation, i.e. within 24 hours if continuous thrombolysis is not applied. However, as a result of this intervention, atherosclerotic plaques are ruptured and platelets aggregate at the site of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferns-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferns 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuster 1995</LINK>). Extensive vessel wall damage coupled with low shear stress and poor infrapopliteal outflow are mostly responsible for the occurrence of reocclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wentzel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wentzel 2003</LINK>). Additionally, in the initial phase after catheter intervention, a hypercoagulable state prevails, as parameters of activated coagulation, including thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), D-Dimer and Fibrinopeptide A (Fa) become elevated in the plasma (<LINK REF="REF-Tsch_x00f6_pl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschöpl 1997</LINK>). This activated coagulation system produces conditions favourable for early thrombotic occlusion, where 'early' is usually defined as a period covering the first four weeks after the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Tsakiris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsakiris 1999</LINK>). Subsequently, a condition of the arterial wall called 'intimal hyperplasia' may follow which is responsible for intermediate and late-term restenosis and reocclusion. Intimal hyperplasia occurs as a result of denudation (tearing off of the inner lining) of the endothelium caused by manipulation of the vessel wall with the catheter. Media smooth muscle cells are stimulated to grow into the intimal layer followed by the inclusion of foam cells and calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Haudenschild-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haudenschild 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1990</LINK>). Reported rates of arterial reocclusion or symptomatic restenosis following femoropopliteal PTA are between 5% and 25% for early events and about 40% at one year (<LINK REF="REF-Schillinger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillinger 2003</LINK>). The five-year patency rate was reported to be 83% for iliac and 58% for femoropopliteal PTA, whilst patients with stenoses or occlusions of less than 3 cm had a favourable long-term patency rate of 74% (<LINK REF="REF-Gallino-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallino 1984</LINK>). Patients subjected to local thrombolysis show higher incidences (<LINK REF="REF-Decrinis-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decrinis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parent-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parent 1989</LINK>). The implantation of drug-eluting or nitinol stents (<LINK REF="REF-Mewissen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mewissen 2004</LINK>) following PTA is considered an intervention with the capacity to reduce the occurrence of intimal hyperplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Duda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vogel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogel 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Drug interventions to prevent thrombosis and/or intimal hyperplasia leading to reocclusion and restenosis of the treated segments would make an important contribution to the sustained success of endovascular treatment. Current peri-interventional treatment strategies mostly include aspirin intake before and after PTA, initial administration of either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1989</LINK>) followed mostly by antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants on a long-term basis (<LINK REF="STD-Do-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Do 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hess-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shammas-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shammas 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2000</LINK>).

<P>Three authors (LR, MG, FK) independently assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The 'Risk of bias' tool provides a strict protocol to assess allocation (selection bias), blinding (performance bias and detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other potential sources of bias. For each of the six domains, we assessed the risk of bias as 'low risk', 'high risk' or as 'unclear risk of bias', with unclear risk of bias indicating that there was insufficient information available to permit judgement of either low or high risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the three authors.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 11:55:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The unit of randomisation was the individual participant in the majority of included studies. Where studies included patients undergoing bilateral PTA, we gave consideration to whether the limbs had the same or different treatments. Only studies where both limbs received exactly the same treatment were included. For these studies, we evaluated data by limb rather than patient. All of the trials involved repeat observations on participants at different points in time ranging from 24 hours to 36 months post PTA and thus were prone to unit of analysis errors. Therefore, for the purpose of this review, we chose 12 months as the primary time point for measuring reocclusion. Where two or more studies with low methodological and statistical heterogeneity were included, we performed a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Not all trials specified inclusion criteria for occlusion size. In the few studies that did report it, the length of occlusions varied from 1 to 20 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK>), &lt; 3 to 10 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Ranke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ranke 1994</LINK>), &gt; 3 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Pilger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pilger 1991</LINK>), &gt; 5 cm (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK>), &#8805; 7 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Ansel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ansel 2006</LINK>) and &#8804; 10 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Do-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Do 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1987</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Endovascular procedures</HEADING>
<P>PTA was performed either in the pelvic, femoral or popliteal regions. PTA alone was the technique used most frequently, while in some studies local thrombolysis and thromboembolectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK>) or stent implantation was performed in some of the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ansel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ansel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Iida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2008</LINK>, patients who did not have a medical indication for stent implantation after PTA were excluded from the trial.</P>
<P>One study included patients treated by laser-assisted angioplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Pilger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pilger 1991)</LINK>. Randomisation occurred mostly after successful revascularisation but some studies randomised before PTA and then excluded patients in whom the revascularisation procedure was unsuccessful (<LINK REF="STD-Nehler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nehler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). Where randomisation was performed before endovascular treatment, patients were excluded from the evaluation concerning antithrombotic treatment during follow-up. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Weichert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weichert 1994</LINK> randomised patients to treatment 48 hours after the PTA procedure. Consequently any participant with an occlusion within 48 hours of the procedure was excluded from the study.</P>
<P>Patients were usually started on antiplatelet therapy the day before the endovascular treatment. Therapeutic standard was to administer 5000 IU heparin intra-arterially during the endovascular intervention and to start all patients on ASA at least one day before catheter interventions. Some studies used administered clopidogrel in addition to aspirin prior to the PTA procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Ansel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ansel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2008</LINK>).</P>

Additionally, this trial was halted early due to safety issues regarding nitinol stent fractures. In <LINK REF="STD-Do-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Do 1994</LINK> there was an imbalance in the proportion of participants with femoropopliteal occlusions in the two treatment groups. In <LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK> there was an imbalance in post interventional treatment between the study groups, with participants randomised to abciximab given VKA post PTA while those randomised to a placebo were given ASA post PTA. Furthermore, this study included five participants who underwent PTA on both limbs making it unclear how this would affect the study results. In <LINK REF="STD-Koppensteiner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koppensteiner 2006</LINK>, the baseline characteristics of the study population were different: 73% of the intermittent claudication group were smokers compared to 53% of the critical limb ischaemia group. Such an imbalance in this important risk factor is likely to affect the results. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Nehler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nehler 2007</LINK> was terminated early after an interim analysis was completed after only 36% of the planned study participants had completed the six-month assessment. Furthermore, the authors also reported that this study was underpowered to detect a small possible effect size. <LINK REF="STD-Weichert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Weichert 1994</LINK> was also stopped earlier than planned, suggesting that the trialists were hoping for a particular result. Stopping the trial early is likely to have biased the estimate of treatment effect. Consequently, we deemed these two studies to be at a high risk of reporting bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Batroxobin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial on 111 diabetic patients with critical limb ischaemia, defined as Rutherford classification III or worse, and concluded that batroxobin plus aspirin reduced the rate of restenosis after arterial angioplasty (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60). Authors presented detailed data according to the number, site and length of lesions. Fifty-one patients treated with batroxobin had a total of 246 lesions compared to 267 lesions in the 60 control patients. The majority of lesions were in the infrapopliteal segment (70.3% versus 77.2%) and the remainder were in the femoropopliteal artery (29.7% versus 22.8% in the batroxobin and control groups respectively). Batroxobin was particularly effective in reducing restenosis in the infrapopliteal artery (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79; P = 0.003) but did not significantly reduce the rate of restenosis in the femoropopliteal artery (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.32). Results also indicated that batroxobin was superior to aspirin alone in the treatment of lesions greater than 10 cm (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74; P = 0.002) but not in lesions less than 10 cm (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.22). There were no significant differences in the number of deaths (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.59) nor amputations (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.00) between the treatment and control groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Candesartan versus quinapril</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schindler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schindler 2008</LINK> compared the AT1-receptor blocker candesartan against the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril on restenosis after stent angioplasty in the superficial femoral artery. Eleven patients were randomised into each treatment group. The authors reported that candesartan was of benefit in reducing restenosis but this did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.31). The authors reported the number of adverse events but did not state their nature. The rate did not differ significantly by treatment group (OR 3.75, 95% CI 0.32 to 43.31).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:35:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, eight new trials were added to trials included in the original review, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet, anticoagulant or other vasoactive agents administered in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) treated by catheter intervention in the pelvic or femoropopliteal arteries.</P>
<P>At six months following endovascular treatment, a statistically non-significant positive effect on patency was shown with 50 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) combined with dipyridamole (DIP), evaluated in only a small group of 356 patients. When looking at fixed-effect odds ratios (OR) of the single trials, it was striking that <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1990</LINK> et al reported a considerably stronger effect than the Swedish group (<LINK REF="STD-Study-group-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Study group 1994</LINK>) (OR 0.51 versus 0.83, respectively). This difference might be due to the fact that in the Heiss study, 96% of the patients presented with intermittent claudication and only 4% of patients suffered from critical limb ischaemia, whereas in the Swedish trial only 59% of patients included were claudicants but 41% had critical limb ischaemia, the latter being a stronger risk factor for a poor outcome. The incidences of death and amputation, as recorded in the Swedish group, were only different regarding amputation for patients receiving aspirin. Possible reasons for this lack of effect might be the small number of patients (only one trial including 223 patients), short follow-up and endpoint not being evaluated systematically in all patients.</P>
<P>The question of whether combined therapy with ASA/DIP would be superior to ASA alone in terms of early occlusion was investigated in one early trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hess-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hess 1978</LINK>). Results could not significantly prove superiority of the addition of DIP to ASA. Moreover, it should be pointed out that all the placebo-controlled comparisons looked at ASA and DIP and there were no unconfounded randomised comparisons of ASA alone versus placebo. Thus, it cannot be concluded that aspirin is indicated. Indeed, the meta-analysis of ASA/DIP versus placebo did not show evidence of efficacy of ASA/DIP, implying that any form of prophylaxis might not be indicated here. However, this may reflect a lack of evidence rather than a lack of efficacy.</P>
<P>We pooled data extracted from four further trials comparing high-dose to low-dose ASA to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients treated with angioplasty presenting with the same characteristics described above. Analysis of these data revealed that higher doses of ASA (300 to 1000 mg) did not significantly improve patency rates following angioplasty compared with low doses of ASA (50 to 300 mg) at any time point of follow-up. This indicates that neither early nor late reocclusion rates are reduced with higher doses of ASA. In contrast, side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, were clearly more frequent in the high-dose groups.</P>
<P>Two studies comparing ASA/DIP with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in 289 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Do-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Do 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pilger 1991</LINK>) found that antiplatelet therapy had a tendency to improve patency after femoropopliteal angioplasty at three, six and 12 months but this did not reach statistical significance. However, the trials differed by the fact that patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Pilger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pilger 1991</LINK> trial all had long chronic femoropopliteal occlusions that were recanalised by laser-assisted angioplasty. This population has a much higher risk for reocclusion than the population evaluated in the <LINK REF="STD-Do-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Do 1994</LINK> trial. This might be the reason why VKA showed a tendency to improve patency at one month. At later time points, results suggest that platelet activation may play a more important role in the mechanism of arterial reocclusion of catheter-treated artery segments than the local coagulation system does. This hypothesis is emphasised by the results of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1987</LINK>), comparing ticlopidine, a thienopyridine derivative, with a VKA.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Iida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Iida 2008</LINK> offered evidence on the effectiveness of the antiplatelets cilostazol versus ticlopidine. The trial showed that cilostazol was more effective than ticlopidine in preventing reocclusion at 12, 24 and 36 months after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). However, this study was open label and thus at high risk of performance bias. <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1987</LINK> had previously measured the effectiveness of ticlopidine compared with the anticoagulant VKA, showing no difference in restenosis rates at 12 months.</P>
<P>The efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was assessed in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK> determined that clopidogrel plus aspirin offered no favourable effect over LMWH followed by warfarin but those treated with LMWH were at increased risk of major bleeding. The other study by <LINK REF="STD-Koppensteiner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koppensteiner 2006</LINK> showed that LMWH, when combined with aspirin, had a positive effect on restenosis rates in patients with critical limb ischaemia but in patients with intermittent claudication, LMWH offered no advantage over aspirin alone.</P>
<P>Two of the studies included in the review measured the efficacy of abciximab. The <LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2007</LINK> trial was completed on 392 participants while the study by <LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK> was only on 98 participants. This difference in study size is reflected in the confidence intervals around the risk, with <LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2007</LINK> showing narrower confidence intervals reflecting the larger sample size. Both trials administered the same dosage of abciximab (0.25 mg/kg bolus then maintenance of 0.125 mcg/kg/min for 12 hours). However, pre- and post PTA treatments differed slightly. <LINK REF="STD-Baumgartner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgartner 2007</LINK> administered ASA 100 mg/day and also clopidogrel 65 mg/day for 28 days while <LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK> administered heparin during the introduction and after the removal of the arterial sheath.</P>
<P>Overall, batroxobin was associated with a significant improvement in restenosis rates in patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). Analysis by lesion location and length showed that it was most effective in treating lesions greater than 10 cm and also in those located below the knee. However this evidence is based on only one study and all participants were diabetic. Further studies examining different lesion sizes and locations in non-diabetic patients are required before substantial conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of batroxobin.</P>
<P>A number of trials evaluated the efficacy of antithrombotic drugs on early patency, especially in high-risk long-segment femoropopliteal occlusions. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> gives an overview of the reported early patency rates in the respective treatment and control groups. The range is between 70% and 99%, with a tendency towards improved rates occurring within recent years. Reasons for this improvement might be the availability of more sophisticated interventional devices as well as standard therapy with pre-interventional administration of ASA and intra-interventional of heparin. One trial gave evidence that intra- and post interventional administration of LMWH is significantly more effective on early as well as mid-term patency rates after femoropopliteal angioplasty without increased bleeding risks (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2001</LINK>). It seems that otherwise reported inhibition of intimal hyperplasia by LMWH might be an interesting hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1998</LINK>). Reported data of non-controlled trials using direct thrombin inhibitors as, for example, bivalirudin in the same situation suggest an even more potent effect with less bleeding complications (<LINK REF="STD-Allie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Allie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shammas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shammas 2003</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials, however, are still not available. Another drug that has been used as an adjunctive treatment in long-segment femoropopliteal occlusions is the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab which must be administered intravenously. This potent platelet inhibitor seems to be effective at avoiding early thrombotic occlusions caused by extended endothelial lesion and dissections caused by manipulation with the angioplasty catheter (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rffler_x002d_Melly-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dörffler-Melly 2005</LINK>). A 90% and 80% reduction of occlusion risk was found at 24 hours and one month following recanalisation and an almost 60% reduction was seen after six months.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is limited evidence suggesting that restenosis/reocclusion at six months following peripheral endovascular treatment is reduced by use of antiplatelet drugs compared with placebo/control, but associated information on bleeding and gastrointestinal side effects is lacking. There is also some evidence of variation in effect according to different drugs with cilostazol reducing reocclusion/restenosis at 12 months compared with ticlopidine and both LMWH and batroxobin combined with aspirin appearing beneficial compared with aspirin alone. However, available trials are generally small and of variable quality and side effects of drugs are not consistently addressed. Further good quality, large-scale RCTs, stratified by severity of disease, are required.<BR/>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:35:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has to be noted that in the present systematic review, the individual trials are heterogeneous and pooled data should be considered cautiously. In particular, the location of the stenosis or occlusion to be treated was sometimes in the pelvic region and in a majority of people in the femoropopliteal segment, a fact that is associated with a difference in endovascular results. Therefore, patency rates of interventions above the inguinal ligament (pelvic) are basically higher compared with those below the inguinal ligament (femoropopliteal or below). The same is true for short versus long segment obstructions. Due to the relatively small number of available trials and patients per comparison, a subgroup analysis of the outcome in iliac or femoropopliteal obstructions could not be performed. Furthermore, few of the included studies presented data according to severity of PAD. Therefore treatment was often administered to an overall study sample which included participants with intermittent claudication or critical limb ischaemia. Grouping these patients together with no regard for stage of disease could influence the results observed as critical limb ischaemia is associated with a higher reocclusion rate. Where possible, we performed subgroup analysis by severity of venous disease.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:36:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the majority of the included studies the risk of bias was low or unclear. Selection bias could not be determined in the majority of studies as authors failed to report the methods used in concealing allocation and random number generation. Not all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were blinded and therefore we deemed the risk of performance bias high or unclear in over half of the studies. The majority of studies accounted for all participants and reported data on all pre-specified study outcomes, thus contributing to the low risk of attrition and reporting bias observed. The majority of studies were free from other sources of bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:36:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review we identified all the RCTs that compared antithrombotic drugs with other drugs, placebo or no treatment in the prevention of reocclusion after peripheral endovascular treatment. We believe our search for RCTs has been inclusive and it is unlikely that our standardised methods of study selection and data extraction could have introduced bias. Due to the variable presentation of the outcomes by the trialists we could not always pool the data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:37:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that clopidogrel combined with aspirin provides a more potent inhibition of platelet aggregation. This was supported by the CURE trial (<LINK REF="REF-CURE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">CURE 2003</LINK>) of patients with acute coronary syndromes, where the number of vascular events such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke was significantly reduced with clopidogrel. However, the trial also determined that clopidogrel increased the risk of major bleeding. The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2008</LINK>) included in our review which measured the effectiveness of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared to LMWH followed by warfarin, found no significant treatment effect for either of the two drug regimens. Furthermore, the rate of major bleeding was significantly lower in the clopidogrel group than in those treated with LMWH.</P>
<P>Another clinical trial evaluated clopidogrel combined with ASA versus ASA after femoropopliteal angioplasty (Clopidogrel and Aspirin in the Management of Peripheral Endovascular Revascularisation) (<LINK REF="REF-CAMPER" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAMPER</LINK>). Unfortunately, this study had to be stopped due to insufficient randomisation numbers after one year. It seems that too many patients treated for femoropopliteal angioplasty in the USA already receive off-label combined clopidogrel/aspirin therapy. Thus, whether or not this combination therapy is useful for improving femoropopliteal patency and other clinical endpoints in PAD patients might never be elucidated.</P>

<P>There is a lack of randomised clinical trials showing the effect of specific duration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) treated with peripheral angioplasty. Trials are required with sample sizes large enough to be able to detect clinically relevant treatment benefits, to show whether any form of prophylaxis is needed in this area. In addition, all trialists studying the effect of any preventive drug for early or late reocclusion after PTA should present most of their data detailed not only for therapy groups, but also stratified according to severity of disease with subgroups for participants with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia and diabetes. Where possible, trials should present data according to regions above or below the inguinal ligament as suggested by the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (<LINK REF="REF-TASC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC 2000</LINK>). Clinical trials evaluating the usefulness of thienopyridines, clopidogrel, LMWHs, direct thrombin inhibitors or other new antithrombotic agents might contribute to a sustained treatment effect of peripheral endovascular treatment in patients with PAD.</P>

<P>Sex: 35 (68.6%) men, 17 (63%) men abciximab group, 18 (75%) men placebo group</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria: &#8805; 20 years, intermittent claudication requiring percutaneous revascularisation of a single lower extremity, angiographic stenosis of SFA &#8805; 60% length (&#8805; 7 cm), occlusions (&#8804; 22 cm), with at least one patent tibial artery</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: contraindication to antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, contrast media or to any other medication used in the study protocol due to allergic reactions, bleeding diatheses, coagulopathy or other disorder, allergic to nitinol, concomitant hepatic insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, uremia or deep vein thrombus and/or receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy, recent haemorrhagic stroke (&lt; 6 months), contraindication to abciximab, septicaemia at time of procedure, severe co-existing illness that may prove life threatening within 12 months or life expectancy &lt; 1 year, occluded popliteal artery making stent thrombosis likely, aneurysm in the SFA or popliteal artery, poor aortoiliac or common femoral "inflow" which would not be adequate to support a femoropopliteal bypass graft, significant vessel tortuosity, prior revascularisation of the same limb within 30 days of study procedure, reference vessel diameter &lt; 4 mm</P>

<P>Treatment: abciximab 0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 10 µg/min infusion for 12 hours</P>
<P>Control: placebo bolus and infusion (saline provided in vials that matched abciximab)</P>
<P>All patients received intravenous heparin therapy, 325 mg orally once daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily at least 24 hours prior to the procedure.

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:40:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary: cumulative restenosis defined as a decrease in ankle brachial index of &gt; 0.15 and in-stent duplex scan systolic velocity ratio of &#8805; 2.5</P>
<P>Primary: adverse clinical event defined as death (30-day) or repeat revascularisation within 9 months</P>
<P>Secondary: acute angiographic success, absence of procedural-related complications (i.e. death, stroke, bleeding requiring &gt; 2 units blood transfusion), any complication that required hospital admission or surgical procedure, change in walking time to claudication at 9 months, change in Rutherford category at 9 months, maintenance of primary patency at 9 months</P>

<CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2012-05-03 13:39:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results reported in the paper are conflicting. Table V shows the restenosis rate of 12.0% in the abciximab group and 13.4% in the placebo group at 9 months. However, in the text of the results section, the restenosis rates are reported as the opposite way round: 13.4% in the abciximab group and 12.0% in the placebo group. Contact was made with the author to clarify the results but we were unsuccessful in resolving this issue.</P>
<P>The trial was halted early, at approximately 50% of the planned enrolment, due to data from a European trial which demonstrated an association between nitinol and stent fractures.</P>

<P>Inappropriate randomisation. Performance bias. Only indirect rather than direct outcome measure for patency. Authors contacted for allocation to the specific comparison groups of those patients reported to have suffered from reocclusion; detailed information on randomisation procedure. Seemingly, patients were randomised consecutively with alternating allocation.</P>
<P>Six patients did not receive aspirin and thus were treated differently causing a performance bias. They should have been excluded from the study to avoid such bias. A total of 115 patients were included and randomised one day before PTA. They were assigned to 4 different groups: Group A consisted of 25 patients (10 women, 15 men), mean age was 64 years, 22 had femoropopliteal occlusions (mean length 5.5 cm), and three had aorto-iliacal occlusions, 24 with successful PTA. 24/25 had PAOD stage IIb, one was stage III. Group B included 24 patients (18 men, 6 women), mean age 63 years, 20 femoropopliteal occlusions, four aorto-iliacal occlusion (mean length 5 cm), 19 had stage IIb, 1 stage IIa, 4 stage III; 24 had successful PTA. Group C included 27 patients (22 men, 5 women) with stenoses (mean length 1.7 cm), 19 on the femoropopliteal level, 8 aorto-iliacal; 19 patients presented with stage IIa, 7 with stage IIa, 1 with stage III. Mean age was 60 years, all patients underwent successful PTA. Group D consisted of 26 patients (23 men, 3 women), mean age was 59 years, 15 stenoses were on the femoropopliteal segment, 11 on the aorto-iliacal level (mean length 1.4 cm). 19 patients had stage IIb, 7 had stage IIa. All patients received ASA 250 mg daily except for 6 patients of whom it was not reported to which group they belonged (4 stopped for side effects and 2 patients with known allergies). Patients in group A and C received peroral heparan sulfate 100 mg daily in addition. Drug medication was started on the day of the intervention and continued for 3 to 4 months.</P>

<P>Quote: "After the inclusion of 218 patients no difference between the two dosages concerning reocclusion rate and side effects was detected. Since it was not expected, that the results with the intended 600 patients would relevantly change these results, the trial was stopped"</P>
<P>Comment: authors stopped the trial when the treatment was shown to be more or less effective than hoped. Stopping the trial early is likely to bias the estimate of treatment effect.</P>
