<P>
<B>Who may be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>People with bipolar disorder and their healthcare providers.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that is a common mental health problem. Patients may experience recurrent symptoms of elevated or irritable mood, depression, or a combination of both. Treatment is usually with psychiatric medication; commonly used medications include mood stabilisers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Topiramate is a drug used in epilepsy, however it may have a role in the treatment of bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>This review investigated the effectiveness and acceptability of topiramate compared to placebo and other agents in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>
<B>Which studies were included in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases to find reports of clinical trials (specifically randomised controlled trials) published up to 13 October 2015. We identified six studies that involved 1638 people. The studies compared topiramate with placebo or conventional medication such as lithium, both on its own or in combination with other treatments such as sodium valproate or atypical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>Five of the studies were at low risk of bias in the majority of the domains, and at unclear risk for allocation concealment (because of insufficient details regarding how those who admitted participants to a study were shielded from knowing the assignments) and other potential sources of bias (because they were industry funded). The <A HREF="McIntyre 2000">McIntyre 2000</A> study was at high risk of performance bias (because participants and personnel knew who was taking each medication); at low risk for attrition bias and reporting bias; and at unclear risk of bias for the other domains.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>We found moderate-quality evidence showing that topiramate is no more or less effective than placebo when used alone, and low-quality evidence that topiramate is no more or less effective than placebo when added to other drugs in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes. We found high-quality evidence that lithium is more effective than topiramate when used alone in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes. Low- and very low-quality evidence showed no difference in side effect profiles when topiramate was compared with placebo or alternative drugs when used alone or in combination with other treatments.</P>
<P>Limitations of the review were that the quality of the evidence was generally low, therefore there is a need for further research. Future research could involve more controlled studies with clearly detailed methods comparing topiramate with placebo and alternative or combination bipolar treatments for manic, mixed, and depressive episodes.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-15 12:11:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included six studies with a total of 1638 male and female participants, of all ethnic backgrounds in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In five studies, participants were experiencing a manic or mixed episode, and in the other study the participants met the criteria for a depressive phase. Topiramate was compared with placebo and alternative pharmacological treatment as both monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment.</P>
<P>Moderate-quality evidence showed topiramate to be no more or less efficacious than placebo as monotherapy, in terms of mean change on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (range 0 to 60), at endpoint 3 weeks (MD 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 2.86; participants = 664; studies = 3; P = 0.17) and at endpoint 12 weeks (MD -0.58, 95% CI -3.45 to 2.29; participants = 212; studies = 1; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). For the same outcome, low-quality evidence also showed topiramate to be no more or less efficacious than placebo as add-on therapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (MD -0.14, 95% CI -2.10 to 1.82; participants = 287; studies = 1; P = 0.89) in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes. We found high-quality evidence that lithium was more efficacious than topiramate as monotherapy in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes in terms of mean change on YMRS (range 0 to 60) (endpoint 12 weeks) (MD 8.46, 95% CI 5.86 to 11.06; participants = 449; studies = 2; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>For troublesome side effects experienced of any nature, we found no difference between topiramate and placebo as monotherapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.40; participants = 212; studies = 1; P = 0.30; low-quality evidence) or as add-on therapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.10; participants = 287; studies = 1; P = 0.76; low-quality evidence). In terms of participants experiencing side effects of any nature, we found no difference between topiramate and an alternative drug as monotherapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.52; participants = 230; studies = 1; P = 0.63; low-quality evidence) or as add-on therapy (endpoint 8 weeks) (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.90; participants = 36; studies = 1; P = 0.50; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>We considered five of the studies to be at low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases, and at unclear risk for allocation concealment and other potential sources of bias. We considered the <A HREF="McIntyre 2000">McIntyre 2000</A> study to be at high risk of performance bias; unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and other potential sources of bias; and at low risk for attrition bias and reporting bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-22 08:13:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the use of topiramate in clinical practice from this evidence. The only high-quality evidence found was that lithium is more efficacious than topiramate when used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder, and we note that this evidence came from only two studies. Moderate-quality evidence showed that topiramate was no more or less efficacious than placebo as monotherapy when a 3-week endpoint was used, but the quality of the evidence for this outcome at a 12-week endpoint dropped to low. As we graded the quality of the evidence for the other findings as low and very low, it was not possible to draw any conclusions from the results.</P>
<P>To best address this research question, if investigators see the indication in so doing, more double-blind randomised controlled trials could be conducted that are more explicit with regard to methodological issues. In particular, investigators could compare placebo, alternative, and combination treatments (including a wide range of mood stabilisers), atypical antipsychotics for manic and mixed episodes, and antidepressants in combination with mood stabilisers or atypical antipsychotics for depressive episodes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-16 21:25:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a common recurrent illness with high rates of chronicity. Although it is classically manifested in recurrent manic, depressed, or mixed episodes with complete interepisode recovery, one-third of patients suffer chronic symptoms, which affect their social and occupational development.</P>
<P>In present classification systems, bipolar disorder now refers to a group of affective (mood) disorders in which patients experience acute episodes of depression for at least two weeks, characterised by low mood and related symptoms (for example loss of pleasure and reduced energy), and acute episodes of either mania for at least one week, characterised by elated or irritable mood or both, and related symptoms such as increased energy and reduced need for sleep, or hypomania, for at least four days, the symptoms of which are less severe or less protracted than are those of mania (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a combined sample of 61,392 adults from 11 countries, the total lifetime prevalences were 0.6% for bipolar disorder type I and 0.4% for bipolar disorder type II (<LINK REF="REF-Merikangas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merikangas 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the World Health Organization&#8217;s 2004 Global Burden of Disease report, along with other psychiatric illnesses, bipolar disorder is one of the 10 most debilitating of all non-communicable diseases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). In addition, bipolar disorder is among the mental disorders that contribute the most disability-adjusted life-years, which is the sum of years lived with disability and years of life lost (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-15 12:12:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>), lithium, olanzapine, and valproate should be considered as first-line treatments for the long-term management of bipolar disorder. For the treatment of acute affective episodes, an antipsychotic (normally olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone), valproate, or lithium should be considered for managing episodes of mania or hypomania. For moderate or severe depressive symptoms, prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) should be considered in addition to an antimanic drug, taking into account the risk of manic switching. Lamotrigine is considered to be a second-line treatment for bipolar depression (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2015</LINK>). Patients suffering from acute mixed episodes should be treated as if they were having an acute manic episode, and prescribing antidepressants should be avoided.</P>
<P>Despite available treatments, there is a high prevalence of incomplete or unsatisfactory treatment responses in bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Poon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poon 2012</LINK>). The characteristics of bipolar disorder that are associated with inferior treatment responses include: very early onset age, rapid cycling, prominent psychotic features, and comorbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is ongoing interest in the efficacy of anticonvulsants in bipolar disorder. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant used in the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Retrospective and prospective uncontrolled open trials have supported the efficacy of topiramate in refractory bipolar disorder both as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sachs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachs 2000</LINK>), and as an adjunctive treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Marcotte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcotte 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McElroy-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieta 2003</LINK>). The most common side effects of topiramate include sedation, word-finding difficulties, and impaired concentration. Unlike established agents, topiramate is associated with decreased appetite and weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meldrum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldrum 1996</LINK>). A large randomised, placebo-controlled trial over one year supported use of the drug in the treatment of obese participants, with significant improvements in blood pressure and plasma glucose levels (<LINK REF="REF-Wilding-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilding 2004</LINK>). There is evidence in the form of a review that topiramate-treated patients with affective (more commonly known as mood) disorders may also experience weight reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-16 19:57:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topiramate has several actions that are potentially therapeutic in bipolar disorder. For example, it can stabilise the membranes of neurons by blocking sodium channels, block glutamate receptors, and increase the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meldrum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldrum 1996</LINK>). Indeed, people with bipolar disorder have been found to have decreased plasma levels of GABA during both depressive and manic episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Petty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petty 1995</LINK>) manic episodes.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-21 02:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment resistance in bipolar disorder remains a problem, and new medications that are both efficacious and well-tolerated are required. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group has already carried out several reviews on a variety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2006</LINK>). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2006</LINK>), which studied the evidence for the use of topiramate in the treatment of acute episodes of this disorder. The review authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of topiramate in any phase of bipolar illness, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. At the time of the previous review several unpublished trials were identified, therefore it is important to update the review in order to include them as well as other randomised controlled trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 39,000 reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, self harm, and other mental disorders within the scope of this Group. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register, and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary; please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the CCDAN's registers are collated from routine (quarterly) searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); weekly generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization's trials portal (the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>)) and <A HREF="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, pharmaceutical companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings, and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

<P>In two studies topiramate was used as an adjunctive treatment.

In the other study topiramate (titrated until clinical response from 50 mg up to 300 mg/day) was added to divalproex sodium, lithium, or an atypical antipsychotic versus bupropion sustained-release (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2000</LINK>). In four studies topiramate was administered as a monotherapy versus placebo.

<P>In one study participants were permitted to continue taking a stable dose of an oral antipsychotic agent (<LINK REF="STD-Chengappa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chengappa 2006</LINK>), as well as subtherapeutic doses of antidepressants. In addition, the use of short-acting benzodiazepines for sleep or agitation was permitted only during the first four weeks. There was no significant difference in the treatment response of participants receiving concomitant antipsychotics versus those who did not. In one study participants were not permitted to receive concomitant antidepressant treatment (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2000</LINK>); there was no mention of use of benzodiazepines. In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-PDMD_x002d_004-Kushner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PDMD-004 Kushner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PDMD_x002d_005-Kushner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PDMD-005 Kushner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PDMD_x002d_006-Kushner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PDMD-006 Kushner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PDMD_x002d_008-Kushner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PDMD-008 Kushner 2006</LINK>), during the first 14 days chloral hydrate, non-benzodiazepine short-acting sedative hypnotics, and short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytics could be used as rescue medication. Participants requiring antipsychotics or mood stabilisers were discontinued. Non-pharmacological interventions other than supportive or educational psychotherapy were prohibited.</P>
<P>In the Chengappa et al trial, participants received the interventions for 12 weeks. The McIntyre et al trial was an eight-week trial.

In the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2000</LINK>), the primary efficacy measure was the percentage of participants responding to treatment as measured by: (a) 50% reduction from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17); and (b) remission defined as endpoint HDRS-17 score of equal to or less than 7. As the primary efficacy outcome in this review was change in mean score from baseline to endpoint in rating scale, and as per previous Cochrane review <LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2006</LINK>, we attempted to contact the author to obtain original data but were unsuccessful.</P>

Moderate-quality evidence suggests no difference in efficacy between topiramate and placebo as monotherapy in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes. The evidence for topiramate for the other outcomes was generally of low quality. The evidence for the use of topiramate in depressive episodes was of very low quality, so we are uncertain about the estimate.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-21 23:29:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the studies identified in this review, five examined manic and mixed episodes, and one looked at depressive episodes. Overall, the objectives of the review (<LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK>) were addressed, although the studies did not provide appropriate data for some of the outcomes. We investigated all relevant types of participants in terms of their characteristics, diagnosis, and the setting in which they were treated. However, patients were excluded if they had DSM-IV Axis I and II and physical comorbidities which would limit the applicability of the evidence. We examined relevant types of intervention, however the only alternative drug topiramate was compared to was lithium. In addition, the add-on drugs used were limited to atypical antipsychotics. This would limit the applicability of the findings when compared to current clinical practice.</P>
<P>Cognitive side effects were not specifically elicited with cognitive testing with pre- and post-neuropsychological tests, which are one of the main types of side effects limiting the use of topiramate. Also, in the 'Summary of findings' tables the reader will note that there was no data available for many outcomes. However, the studies were worthy of inclusion in the meta-analysis because they met the inclusion criteria and addressed the primary outcome. We are not clear why remission and response to treatment topiramate were not reported for many of the studies, as they are important in terms of clinical practice and prognosis.</P>

<P>This systematic review is an update of the previous systematic Cochrane intervention review on topiramate for acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder conducted in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2006</LINK>). The previous review included only one study, which was also included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2000</LINK>), along with more RCTs. This review was in agreement with other reviews that evaluated topiramate in the treatment of bipolar disorder which did not find evidence of efficacy for topiramate in the short term or when used to supplement standard mood-stabilising treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Poon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poon 2012</LINK>), and did not support the efficacy of topiramate as monotherapy in acute mania and mixed episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Rosa-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosa 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-21 23:39:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the use of topiramate in clinical practice from this evidence. The only high-quality evidence found was that lithium was more efficacious than topiramate when used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder, and we note that this evidence came from only two studies. Moderate-quality evidence did not find topiramate to be more efficacious than placebo when a 3-week endpoint was used, however the evidence contributing to the 12-week time point for this outcome was of only low quality. It was not possible to draw conclusions about the use of topiramate as an adjunctive treatment in acute affective episodes or to comment on the acceptability of topiramate in a clinical context, as overall the quality of the evidence was low. The practical usefulness of topiramate in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder therefore remains questionable.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-15 12:17:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the evidence base for the use of topiramate in acute affective episodes in bipolar is limited by the quality of the research, for example imprecision (small population size, small number of events, wide confidence intervals which also include no effect) or high risk of bias (single-blind study), further research could address this. For example, more double-blind RCTs would be appropriate that are more explicit with regard to methodological issues and comparing placebo, alternative and combination treatments (including a wide range of mood stabilisers), atypical antipsychotics for manic and mixed episodes, and also antidepressants in combination with mood stabilisers or atypical antipsychotics for depressive episodes.</P>
<P>To help people make well-informed decisions about future healthcare research, we propose the following research suggestions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Population: patients with all subtypes of bipolar disorder, acute affective episodes, both sexes, 18 and over, all ethnicities, all settings.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: monotherapy, adjunctive therapy.</LI>
<LI>Comparison: placebo, alternative and combination treatments including a wide range of mood stabilisers, atypical antipsychotics for manic and mixed episodes, and also antidepressants in combination with mood stabilisers or atypical antipsychotics for depressive episodes.</LI>
<LI>Outcome: rating scale scores, remission and response rates, dropouts and reasons why, and detailed side effects. It would be desirable if these were documented for each individual.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To best address this research question, if investigators see the indication in so doing, future studies should be RCTs as well as more explicit with regard to methodological issues such as allocation concealment.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-07-22 00:01:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> recommends a maximum of seven outcomes, therefore we reduced the number of outcomes in the protocol for the review. We added extra information to the section <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK> to clarify the methods used. We added headings for 'Timing of outcome assessment', 'Hierarchy of outcome measures', and 'Summary of findings' tables, as per current Cochrane guidance.</P>
<P>In the last version of the review we used a fixed-effect model (using random-effects models to investigate the sensitivity of results to the choice of statistical method). We believed it to be more appropriate in this version of the review to use a random-effects model for analyses, as it assumes that studies estimate different but related treatment effects.</P>
<P>We slightly reworded the <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK> to fit the recommended Cochrane template.</P>

<P>Description: the randomised population included 444 patients, who were eligible if they were &#8805; 16 years of age with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and hospitalised with an acute manic or mixed episode, confirmed by a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Patients had to have a history of at least 1 previous manic or mixed episode. Patients with comorbid diagnoses were included unless the primary diagnosis was schizoaffective or impulse control disorder or the patient had antisocial or borderline personality disorder. A YMRS score &#8805; 20 at screening and randomisation was required. Women of childbearing age were eligible if they were surgically incapable of bearing children or practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control, were not lactating, and had negative pregnancy tests at screening and baseline.</P>
<P>Other exclusion criteria included rapid cycling bipolar disorder, DSM-IV-defined alcohol or substance abuse/dependence within the previous 3 months, and symptoms associated with recent antidepressant/psychostimulant treatment or with intoxication or withdrawal from psychostimulants such as alcohol, (meth)amphetamines, cocaine, or hallucinogens. Patients were excluded if they were at high risk for suicide, violence, or alcohol/substance abuse, or were likely to require acute intervention with psychotropic medications that could not be discontinued. Patients with unstable or serious medical conditions, seizure disorders, history of nephrolithiasis, or patients taking medication associated with nephrolithiasis were excluded. Exclusion criteria also included the use of substances with potentially confounding psychotropic effects (e.g. St. John&#8217;s wort, calcium channel blockers administered for mania, or antidepressants) within the previous 4 weeks (5 weeks if fluoxetine), clozapine use within the previous 3 months, previous use of topiramate monotherapy for acute mania or mixed episodes for &gt; 4 weeks, previous participation in a topiramate trial, history of severe drug allergy, known hypersensitivity to topiramate, treatment with an experimental drug or medical device within 30 days before screening, known or suspected intolerance to lithium and low-salt diet.</P>

Patients had to have a history of at least 1 previous manic or mixed episode. Patients with comorbid diagnoses were included unless the primary diagnosis was schizoaffective or impulse control disorder or the patient had antisocial or borderline personality disorder. A YMRS score &#8805; 20 at screening and randomisation was required. Women of childbearing age were eligible if they were surgically incapable of bearing children or practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control, were not lactating, and had negative pregnancy tests at screening and baseline.</P>
<P>Other exclusion criteria included rapid cycling bipolar disorder, DSM-IV-defined alcohol or substance abuse/dependence within the previous 3 months, and symptoms associated with recent antidepressant/psychostimulant treatment or with intoxication or withdrawal from psychostimulants such as alcohol, (meth)amphetamines, cocaine, or hallucinogens. Patients were excluded if they were at high risk for suicide, violence, or alcohol/substance abuse, or were likely to require acute intervention with psychotropic medications that could not be discontinued. Patients with unstable or serious medical conditions, seizure disorders, history of nephrolithiasis, or patients taking medication associated with nephrolithiasis were excluded. Exclusion criteria also included the use of substances with potentially confounding psychotropic effects (e.g. St. John&#8217;s wort, calcium channel blockers administered for mania, or antidepressants) within the previous 4 weeks (5 weeks if fluoxetine), clozapine use within the previous 3 months, previous use of topiramate monotherapy for acute mania or mixed episodes for &gt; 4 weeks, previous participation in a topiramate trial, history of severe drug allergy, known hypersensitivity to topiramate, and treatment with an experimental drug or medical device within 30 days before screening.</P>
