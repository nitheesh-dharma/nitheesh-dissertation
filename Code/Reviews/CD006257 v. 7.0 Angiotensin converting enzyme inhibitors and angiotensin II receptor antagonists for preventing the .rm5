<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Kidney disease develops in 25% to 40% of diabetic patients, usually 20 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. Approximately one third of those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) will progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and will require long-term dialysis or possibly receive a kidney transplant. Many patients however may die from associated coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular causes before the onset of ESKD. Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to not only be of benefit to the heart but to also provide kidney protection by slowing the progression of DKD to ESKD. Two drugs in particular have been considered equally effective for patients with DKD - these are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA). However studies have focused on kidney protection rather than over mortality. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms or ACEI and AIIRA therapy in patients with DKD. Fifty studies (13,215 patients) were identified comparing ACEi to placebo, AIIRA to placebo and ACEi to AIIRA. The risk of death from any cause was not significantly reduced with the use of ACEi versus placebo, AIIRA versus placebo or ACEi versus AIIRA. However when we looked at the studies which used the maximum dose tolerated of ACEi rather than the lower, so-called renal doses, there was a significant reduction in the risk of death due to any cause. We were unable to determine which drug provides better protection due to the lack of head-to-head trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA) are considered to be equally effective for patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), but renal and not mortality outcomes have usually been considered. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms ACEi and AIIRA in patients with DKD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE (1980 to December 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I> issue 4 2005) and contacted known investigators.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies comparing ACEi or AIIRA with placebo or each other in patients with DKD were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-27 14:58:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was explored using the Cochran Q statistic and the I test, subgroup analyses and random effects meta-regression.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-27 14:58:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Forty nine studies (12,067 patients) were identified. Thirty eight compared ACEi with placebo, four compared AIIRA with placebo and seven compared ACEi and AIIRA directly. There was no significant difference in the risk of all-cause mortality for ACEi versus placebo (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and AIIRA versus placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17). A subgroup analysis of studies using full-dose ACEi versus studies using half or less than half the maximum tolerable dose of ACEi showed a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality with the use of full-dose ACEi (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). Baseline mortality rates were similar in the ACEi and AIIRA studies. The effects of ACEi and AIIRA on renal outcomes (ESKD, doubling of creatinine, prevention of progression of micro- to macroalbuminuria, remission of micro- to normoalbuminuria) were similarly beneficial. Reliable estimates of effect of ACEi versus AIIRA could not be obtained from the three studies in which they were compared directly because of their small sample size.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although the survival benefits of ACEi are known for patients with DKD, the relative effects on survival of ACEi with AIIRA are unknown due to the lack of adequate direct comparison studies. In placebo controlled studies, only ACEi (at the maximum tolerable dose, but not lower so-called renal doses) were found to significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Renal and toxicity profiles of these two classes of agents were not significantly different.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-27 14:52:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), defined as the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, occurs in 25% to 40% of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients within 20 to 25 years of the onset of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999</LINK>). Both types of patients probably share the same pathogenetic and clinical stages of renal damage, including renal hypertrophy, incipient (microalbuminuria: urine albumin excretion 30-300 mg/d) nephropathy, overt (macroalbuminuria: &gt; 300 mg/d) nephropathy and, finally, the presence of impairment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) up to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (<LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1999</LINK>) About one third of patients with DKD progress to ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Agents used to delay the progression of DKD include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA). Since large scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that ACEi and AIIRA slow the deterioration of renal function and reduce proteinuria, these have become the most broadly used agents in diabetic patients with nephropathy and major international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Arauz_x002d_Pacheo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arauz-Pacheo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-7-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 7 2003</LINK>) advocate for their equivalent use as first line agents in these populations (<LINK REF="STD-CAPTOPRIL-1993" TYPE="STUDY">CAPTOPRIL 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IDNT-2001" TYPE="STUDY">IDNT 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RENAAL-2001" TYPE="STUDY">RENAAL 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>If a patient has diabetes and nephropathy, mortality is reported to be 10% to 40% within 10 years of diagnosis, depending on cardiovascular comorbidities, with the primary cause of early death being fatal cardiovascular events. The presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria has been shown to be an independent risk factor for early death due to cardiovascular events in diabetic patients over and above the increased risk conferred by the diabetic status (<LINK REF="REF-Dinneen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinneen 1997</LINK>). Microalbuminuria is associated with a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of death whereas macroalbuminuria/overt proteinuria and hypertension are associated with an even higher risk when present together.</P>
<P>In view of current guidelines recommendations on equivalent use of ACEi and AIIRA in these populations, we performed a systematic review of RCTs of ACEi and AIIRA used in patients with DKD to evaluate the evidence basis supporting these statements, with particular focus on their effects on renal and cardiovascular outcomes.</P>

<P>This review was undertaken by six authors (GFMS, MC, JD, CB, SDN, JCC). The search strategies described were used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that might be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by (GS, MC, SDN and CB), who discarded studies that were not applicable based on the inclusion criteria for this review, however studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies were retained initially and their full-text version was analysed. Authors GS, MC, SDN and CB independently assessed abstracts of all citations retrieved by the searches and, if necessary, the full text of these studies to determine study eligibility. Data extraction was carried out independently by the same reviewers using standard data extraction forms. Where more than one publication of one trial existed, only the publication with the most complete data was used. Any further information or clarification required from the authors was requested by written or electronic correspondence and relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review. Disagreements in data extraction were resolved by discussion among authors.</P>

In 20 studies, other antihypertensive agents were administered beyond the randomised interventions (ACEi or AIIRA) in a non-randomised fashion to equalise blood pressure in both groups, minimise the confounding effect of blood pressure.

<P>The presence (versus absence) of hypertension in the enrolled populations did not significantly impact on the effect of ACEi compared to placebo/no treatment on all-cause mortality (interaction P value = 0.45), doubling of serum creatinine (interaction P value = 0.22), ESKD (interaction P value = 0.34), but normotensive patients had a significantly higher rate of progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria (interaction P value = 0.001) and significantly higher rate of regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria (interaction P value = 0.01).</P>
<P>The stage of nephropathy in enrolled populations (microalbuminuria versus macroalbuminuria or mixed populations with micro- or macroalbuminuria) did not significantly affect any of these outcomes in patients treated with ACEi compared to placebo/no treatment (all-cause mortality, interaction P value = 0.92; doubling of serum creatinine, interaction P value = 0.88, ESKD, interaction P value = 0.55, progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria, interaction P value = 0.86, regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria, interaction P value = 0.80). There were also no significant variations in the effect of ACEi versus placebo/no treatment on any of these outcomes by any trial quality indicators (allocation concealment, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and proportions of patients lost to follow-up). The few significant differences observed in these analyses were all explained by the results of the large <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2000</LINK> study.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>Placebo controlled studies have shown a survival advantage for ACEi when used at the maximum tolerable dose but not at "renal doses" (half or less than half the maximum tolerable dose) in patients with DKD. On the other hand, there has been no data showing a survival advantage with AIIRA versus placebo/no treatment, in patients with DKD. The relative survival advantage of one class of antihypertensives over the other in this population is, however, still unknown because only indirect comparisons based on small studies are available. ACEi, used at the maximum tolerable dose, significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (mainly cardiovascular) by about 20% and progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria by about 55%. They also increased the rate of regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria by about threefold. We found no evidence that these effects are related to baseline hypertension, type of diabetes, stage of DKD, and duration of treatment. In comparison, current studies of AIIRA in patients with DKD have not shown a reduction in all-cause mortality, with a RR of 0.99 and narrow 95% CI (0.85 to 1.17), which is unlikely to be explained by chance alone. There is strong evidence that AIIRA are beneficial for renal outcomes, with a reduction in risk of ESKD and doubling of serum creatinine of about 22%, a reduction in progression rates from micro- to macroalbuminuria by around 51%, and an increase in the regression from micro- to normoalbuminuria of about 42%. Three potential explanations for these apparent different effects between the two classes of antihypertensives are chance, confounding, and true differences. The usual 5% level for statistical significance was reached for all renal outcomes for AIIRA versus ACEi,and this threshold was reached for ESKD, the prevention of progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria, and regression of micro- to normoalbuminuria, but not doubling of serum creatinine. The point estimates of effect for all renal outcomes favoured ACEi versus AIIRA, but there was some imprecision surrounding these summary point estimates for ACEi due to lower event rates and because of the heterogeneity in study results due to one large study (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2000</LINK>). For all cause mortality, the absence of benefit shown by AIIRA is unlikely to be due to chance alone because the summary point estimate is close to unity (0.99) and the 95% CIs are relatively narrow. We did not formally test differences in ACEi and AIIRA through indirect comparison since there are clear differences in the design and conduct of the ACEi and AIIRA studies, which may explain apparent differences in results if such non randomised comparison was performed. In particular, micro-HOPE primarily included high cardiac risk patients with relatively low renal risk, and although end of treatment blood pressure was not different between the two groups (possibly due to survival bias), equalisation of blood pressure was not targeted and so may have confounded the observed benefit of ramipril. True differences in the relative effects of ACEi and AIIRA can only be established by adequately powered studies that directly compare the two agents, which unfortunately are currently not available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with existing knowledge</HEADING>
<P>In studies that enrolled patients with diabetes without nephropathy (which have not been included in this review), it has been shown that intensive control of blood pressure with any agent reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of type of agent used (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 2001</LINK>). In addition, in one study in which losartan was compared to atenolol in hypertensive patients with diabetes, losartan significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Wachtell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wachtell 2003</LINK>). Following myocardial infarction, ACEi have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Zunetti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zunetti 1996</LINK>), whereas no relevant information with AIIRA are available. Our findings are consistent with other large meta-analyses in patients with congestive heart failure, which showed a significant reduction in the risk of all cause mortality with ACEi versus placebo/no treatment but not for AIIRA (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garg 1995</LINK>). Previous studies have already analysed the role of various antihypertensive agents, including ACEi and AIIRA, in patients affected by DKD. Particular focus was on the effect of ACEi in specific categories of patients (e.g. only type 1 diabetics). A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from the ACEi in DKD Triallist Group concluded that in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria, ACEi significantly reduced progression to macroalbuminuria and increased the chances of regression to normoalbuminuria (<LINK REF="REF-ACEIDN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACEIDN 2001</LINK>). An earlier metaregression analysis indicated that ACEi reduced proteinuria and preserved GFR in patients with diabetes, independent of changes in systemic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1993</LINK>). The main difference with our study is that we included both ACEi and AIIRA studies, obtained additional data from the authors when possible, and evaluated all outcomes of interest, including all-cause mortality, and not simply the traditional renal outcomes. Another meta-analysis on the effects of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive agents on renal outcomes has been recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Casas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casas 2005</LINK>). This analysis, which included small studies conducted in high-risk patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic nephropathies, concluded that there are no superior effects of renin-angiotensin-system blockers over other antihypertensive agents in chronic nephropathies. Comparison between these data and ours is difficult because of different inclusion criteria and research questions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>The strength of this investigation is that it represents a comprehensive systematic review with rigid inclusion criteria for RCTs only; and a comprehensive search strategy. Data extraction, data analysis, and methodological quality assessments were performed by two or more independent investigators, and consistency was checked with all six authors. The major limitation of our study is the lack of direct comparative data of ACEi and AIIRA. Studies directly comparing the two agents were only few and small and did not report outcomes relevant to patients, therefore they were largely uninformative. Other limitations include the small number and suboptimal quality of included studies and the potential for publication bias. These issues are unlikely to be influential as the review is dominated by a few larger studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-26 15:46:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of ACEi in the management of patients with DKD is well established. Recently, equivalence of the newer and more expensive class of antihypertensive agents, AIIRA, has been widely advocated and is accepted in current practice. For example, the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-7-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 7 2003</LINK>) and the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA, <LINK REF="REF-Arauz_x002d_Pacheo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arauz-Pacheo 2003</LINK>), suggest that ACEi and AIIRA can be used interchangeably. Our study shows that there is randomised trial evidence that ACEi versus placebo/no treatment used at their maximum tolerable dose prevent death in patients with DKD, but not that AIIRA versus placebo/no treatment do. Both agents prevent progression of nephropathy and promote regression to a more favourable clinical pattern of normoalbuminuria. The relative effects of ACEi and AIIRA are uncertain. These data suggest that outside of a comparative RCT, ACEi, the cheaper class of agent with proven survival benefit, should be used as first line treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The findings of this study mandate an adequately powered comparative trial of ACEi versus AIIRA with renal and all-cause mortality as measured outcomes. In general studies of the newer pharmacological agents (AIIRA) have been designed as placebo-controlled rather than direct comparisons with existing agents (ACEi). This clearly makes it easier to prove that there is a benefit with the new agent, but harder to prove differential advantage compared to existing ones, as this may be only done by indirect comparison. It should be therefore recommended that future studies compare these agents directly. Given the recent promising results of combination therapy, a factorial trial may be the preferred design. Meanwhile, undertaking an individual patient data meta-analysis may allow the effects of baseline cardiac and renal disease to be better understood and accounted for through subgroup analysis. </P>
