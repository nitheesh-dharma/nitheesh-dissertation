<TITLE>Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-18 12:35:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below.</P>
<P>This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:</P>
<P>&#8226; osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and<BR/>&#8226; no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?</B>
<BR/>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy.</P>
<P>Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis? </B>
<BR/>Follow-up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. </P>
<P>In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non-operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. </P>
<P>Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. </P>
<P>The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique.</P>
<P>Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-17 19:50:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee can be treated with an osteotomy. The goal of an osteotomy is to unload the diseased compartment of the knee. This is the second update of the original review published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2005.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-17 19:53:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of an osteotomy for treating patients with knee osteoarthritis, including the following main outcomes scores: treatment failure, pain and function scores, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, mortality and reoperation rate.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:03:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE (Current Contents, HealthSTAR) were searched until November 2013 for this second update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-17 19:56:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing an osteotomy with other treatments for patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-18 12:30:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the domains recommended in the 'Risk of bias' tool of The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the results was analysed by performing overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-18 07:49:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight new studies were included in this update, for a total of 21 included studies involving 1065 people.</P>
<P>In four studies, the randomised sequence was adequately generated and clearly described. In eight studies, allocation concealment was adequately generated and described. In four studies, the blinding procedures were sufficient. In six studies, incomplete outcome data were not adequately addressed. Furthermore, in 11 studies, the selective outcome reporting item was unclear because no study protocol was provided.</P>
<P>Follow-up of studies comparing different osteotomy techniques was too short to measure treatment failure, which implicates revision to a knee arthroplasty.</P>
<P>Four studies evaluated a closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (CW-HTO) with another high tibial osteotomy (aHTO). Based on these studies, the CW-HTO group had 1.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) -7.7% to 4.2%; low-quality evidence) more pain compared with the aHTO group; this finding was not statistically significant. Pooled function in the CW-HTO group was 0.5% (95% CI -3.8% to 2.8%; low-quality evidence) higher compared with the aHTO group; this finding was not statistically significant. No data on health-related quality of life and mortality were presented.</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were reported in only four studies and were not significantly different (low-quality evidence) between groups. The reoperation rate were scored as early hardware removal because of pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. Risk of reoperation was 2.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.5; low-quality evidence) times higher in the aHTO group compared with the CW-HTO group, and this finding was statistically significant.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for most outcomes comparing different osteotomy techniques was downgraded to low because of the numbers of available studies, the numbers of participants and limitations in design.</P>
<P>Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement. Treatment failure and pain and function scores were not different between groups after a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. The osteotomy group reported more adverse events when compared with the unicompartmental knee replacement group, but the difference was not statistically significant. No data on health-related quality of life and mortality were presented.</P>
<P>No study compared an osteotomy versus conservative treatment.</P>
<P>Ten included studies compared differences in perioperative or postoperative conditions after high tibial osteotomy. In most of these studies, no statistically significant differences in outcomes were noted between groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:11:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusion of this update did not change: Valgus high tibial osteotomy reduces pain and improves knee function in patients with medial compartmental osteoarthritis of the knee. However, this conclusion is based on within-group comparisons, not on non-operative controls. No evidence suggests differences between different osteotomy techniques. No evidence shows whether an osteotomy is more effective than alternative surgical treatment such as unicompartmental knee replacement or non-operative treatment. So far, the results of this updated review do not justify a conclusion on benefit of specific high tibial osteotomy technique for knee osteoarthritis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:36:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:30:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis has a major impact on functioning and independence and ranks among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Badley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). Knee osteoarthritis is the most common joint disorder, and symptomatic disease occurs in 10% of men and 13% of women older than 60 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>). The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis has been estimated to be around 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2008</LINK>). Osteoarthritis of the knee is defined as a multi-factorial disease that may result from both biological and mechanical events.</P>
<P>The knee joint can be divided into three compartments:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Medial compartment, consisting of the medial femur condyle and the medial tibial plateau;</LI>
<LI>Lateral compartment, consisting of the lateral femur condyle and the lateral tibial plateau; and</LI>
<LI>Patellofemoral compartment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Osteoarthritis of the entire knee is distinguished from osteoarthritis of one compartment (<LINK REF="REF-Grelsamer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grelsamer 1995</LINK>), which generally is caused by a mechanical problem (<LINK REF="REF-Tetsworth-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tetsworth 1994</LINK>). The mechanical axis of a straight leg is a line passing from the centre of the hip, through the centre of the knee, to the centre of the ankle (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1998</LINK>). Patients with osteoarthritis of the medial compartment often have varus alignment, and the mechanical axis and load bearing pass through the medial compartment. Patients with osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment often have a valgus alignment, and the mechanical axis and load bearing pass through the lateral compartment. The medial compartment is almost 10 times more frequently involved than the lateral compartment. Moreover, varus but not valgus alignment increases the risk of incident tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2010</LINK>). Both varus malalignment and valgus malalignment increase the progression of knee osteoarthritis and predict declines in physical function (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee not reacting to non-active interventions such as standard care including physiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Anandacoomarasamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anandacoomarasamy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knoop-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knoop 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012</LINK>), or to active non-operative control interventions such as corrective insoles and braces (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-_x0028_2_x0029_-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer (2) 2005</LINK>), intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Berenbaum-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berenbaum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strand-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strand 2012</LINK>) or autologous platelet-rich plasma (<LINK REF="REF-Cerza-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerza 2012</LINK>), or both, can be treated with a correction osteotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Aglietti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aglietti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coventry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coventry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edgerton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgerton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naudie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naudie 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternative surgical treatment for patients with unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis in the standard orthopaedic clinic depends on the degree of osteoarthritis. In cases of early-stage osteoarthritis, arthroscopic debridement of the knee is frequently performed (<LINK REF="REF-Feeley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steadman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steadman 2013</LINK>). In cases of moderate or severe osteoarthritis, unicompartmental or total knee replacement is the preferred treatment option. Cartilage repair surgery such as autologous cartilage implementation, microfracture and an osteochondral autograft transfer system nowadays is possible only when a focal cartilage defect is present in one of the knee compartments, especially on the femoral site (<LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vavken-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vavken 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:34:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An osteotomy is a surgical procedure, which implies that the bone is cut. A correction osteotomy at the knee is used to realign the leg and to transfer the weight-bearing axis from the pathological compartment to the healthy compartment. Patients with osteoarthritis of the medial compartment and varus alignment can be treated with a valgus osteotomy, and those with osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment and valgus alignment with varus osteotomy.</P>
<P>Several correction osteotomy techniques are available for unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis such as the closing wedge technique with removal of a wedge of bone, the opening wedge technique with creation of a wedge, a combined (opening and closing wedge) technique and techniques that are performed without creating a wedge in the bone, including dome osteotomy and hemicallotasis osteotomy with an external fixator (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2009</LINK>). The correction osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis is performed at the proximal tibia or the distal femur. The choice of osteotomy technique and the level of the osteotomy depend on the degree and location of malalignment and the experience of the surgeon in performing one or more of these techniques.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-17 20:34:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A correction osteotomy will change the alignment of the affected leg with unloading of the osteoarthritic compartment of the knee. Unloading will result in slowing down of the osteoarthritis process.

<P>Literature suggests that a correction osteotomy for unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis leads to good results, but many surgical techniques are available. Moreover, a few important surgical alternatives such as intra-articular cartilage repair techniques for early-stage osteoarthritis and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for end-stage osteoarthritis may be selected (<LINK REF="REF-Bouwmeester-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouwmeester 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broughton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broughton 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stukenborg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stukenborg 2001</LINK>).

See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The quality of the presenting results was analysed through an overall grading of evidence by outcome using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>). The highest quality rating is assigned for randomised trial evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach specifies four levels of quality.</P>
<OL>
<LI>High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</LI>

<LI>Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses).</LI>
<LI>Imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals).</LI>
<LI>High probability of publications bias.</LI>

<P>The mean number of included participants in the 21 studies was 52 (range 30 to 100). Mean participant age was 60 years (42 to 67 years). Interventions included different techniques of high tibial osteotomy, high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental joint replacement, different perioperative conditions and different types of postoperative treatment regimens.</P>
<P>Nine studies compared two techniques of high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Most of these studies concerned a valgus high tibial osteotomy for medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. In only two studies, participants with lateral compartment osteoarthritis were also included.</P>
<P>Two studies compared the high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental joint replacement.</P>
<P>Ten studies compared the same type of HTO versus different perioperative conditions (seven studies) or different types of postoperative treatment (three studies). Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental joint replacement. No study compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment. Follow-up in most studies was relatively short (mean 1.8 years, range 0.2 to 7.5 years).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Pain, function, adverse events, reoperation rate, performance-based outcomes and adverse effects of an osteotomy were the most frequently reported outcomes. Performance-based outcome was focused principally on accuracy of postoperative correction. Because of the relatively short follow-up time of most studies, joint imaging was focused on anatomical changes after high tibial osteotomy, not on the degree of progression of osteoarthritis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Major outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Failure of treatment rate (incidence to TKA and time to revision): </B>In all included studies comparing different techniques of HTO, follow-up was too short for scoring of this outcome. Only one longer follow-up study (<LINK REF="STD-Stukenborg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stukenborg 2001</LINK>) comparing high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement scored treatment failure.</P>
<P>
<B>Pain: </B>VAS and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscore were used to measure pain. In all studies, participants reported pain reduction after high tibial osteotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Function: </B>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and WOMAC were the most important scores for measuring function. Lysholm score, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score, American Knee Society Score (KSS), British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) knee score, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) knee score and gait analysis were less frequently used scores for measuring function.</P>
<P>In all studies, participant knee function scores improved after high tibial osteotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Health-related quality of life measure: </B>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score and EuroQol were used to measure this outcome, which improved after high tibial osteotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Serious adverse events: </B>These events, including thromboembolism, neurovascular pathology, intra-articular fracture, deep infection and non-union of the osteotomy, were rarely reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality: </B>This event was not reported in all included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Reoperation rate: </B>This was scored as early hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. These adverse events were significantly more numerous in participants undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minor outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Performance-based outcome: </B>This was scored as achievement of postoperative correction, surgery time, hospital stay, time to healing of the osteotomy and inferior limb length.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects based on anatomical changes:</B> These imply difficulties in performing total knee arthroplasty after high tibial osteotomy. Excessive valgus alignment, patellar descent and change in inclination angle of the tibial plateau were measured side effects in these studies. Alignment was scored according to the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle or the femoral tibial angle (FTA). For change in patellar height, the Insall Salvati, Blackburne Peel and Caton methods were used. The inclination angle of the tibial plateau was measured according to the Moore and Harvey and Brazier et al methods. The mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) and the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) are anatomical changes that may cause difficulties when total knee arthroplasty is performed after high tibial osteotomy. Patellar descent and increased tibial slope were significantly greater after opening wedge high tibial osteotomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Patient Global Assessment:</B> Wallgren-Tegner and the Modified Cincinnati Rating System Questionnaire were used and showed improvement after high tibial osteotomy without statistical significance in between-group differences.</P>
<P>
<B>Other minor outcomes: </B>Joint imaging was measured in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Odenbring-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Odenbring 1992</LINK>); degree of osteoarthritis was measured before and one year after high tibial osteotomy. This study demonstrated no progression of osteoarthritis within one year after osteotomy. <B>VAS satisfaction</B> was measured in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>) and was improved after high tibial osteotomy. <B>Collateral laxity </B>was more improved after opening wedge compared with closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>). <B>Walking distance,</B> which is an indirect measurement of function, was assessed and showed improvement after osteotomy treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies comparing different osteotomy techniques showed no clinical heterogeneity in terms of the study population because the indication for an osteotomy for knee OA is well defined. In eight of these nine studies, another type of osteotomy (aHTO) was compared with the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy. In only one study, other types of osteotomy techniques were compared, and in this study, major outcomes were not scored. Four of these nine studies scored major outcomes, and these data have been pooled. No clinical heterogeneity was noted in duration of follow-up, which in all of these studies was one to two years. Two studies compared the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement. Because of longer follow-up and higher mean age of included participants, these data have not been pooled with those of studies comparing other types of osteotomy with the closing wedge technique. Statistical heterogeneity was considerable for the major outcome of pain (76.3%) and was substantial for the major outcome of function (62.9%). Unimportant heterogeneity was observed for the major outcomes of serious adverse events and reoperation rate.</P>

Because of the heterogeneity of studies, pooling of results was possible only for pain, function, serious adverse events, reoperation rate and accuracy of the correction after a closing wedge high tibial osteotomy versus another high tibial osteotomy technique. Most studies showed improvement in patient-reported outcomes (less pain and improved function scores) after high tibial osteotomy; however most studies also showed no statistically significant differences in comparison with other surgical treatments (other techniques of high tibial osteotomy/unicompartmental joint replacement).</P>

<B>Performance-based outcome,</B> namely, accuracy of postoperative correction scored by the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, was determined in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luites-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luites 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999b</LINK>), and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Adili-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adili 2002</LINK>) was scored by the femoral tibial angle (FTA). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luites-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luites 2009</LINK>) including 181 participants compared the opening wedge with the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy; no difference in mean postoperative correction between the closing wedge and other types of high tibial osteotomy was found in these studies (mean difference (MD) -0.05 degrees, 95% CI -2.61 to 2.51).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects </B>after high tibial osteotomy influencing total knee arthroplasty in the future, such as decreased patellar height and changes in tibial slope, were determined in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2009</LINK>). In one study, these outcomes were presented as means with a range but without a standard deviation or 95% confidence intervals; this prevented any form of statistical analysis. According to the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2009</LINK>), patellar height did not differ significantly between other types of high tibial osteotomy and the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.09). However, according to the two studies comparing the closing with the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>), patellar height was significantly lower in the opening wedge groups. Furthermore, according to two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2009</LINK>), the mean inclination of the tibial plateau was higher (MD 4.45 degrees, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.69) in the other type of high tibial osteotomy compared with the closing wedge group. Furthermore, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>), the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy group showed statistically significant reduction in medial collateral knee laxity compared with the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy group. Finally, in <LINK REF="STD-Papp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Papp 2009</LINK>, combined osteotomy resulted in significantly smaller changes in tibial slope angle and patellar height values when compared with the closing wedge osteotomy.</P>

<P>
<B>VAS satisfaction</B> (0 to 10 scale) was measured in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>) and was improved after high tibial osteotomy. A small difference in favour of the closing wedge technique was measured (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.01). <B>Joint imaging </B>was measured in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Odenbring-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Odenbring 1992</LINK>); degree of OA was measured before and one year after high tibial osteotomy. This study demonstrated no progression of OA after osteotomy within one year. VAS satisfaction was measured in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>) and was improved after high tibial osteotomy. <B>Collateral laxity</B> on the medial side was more improved after opening wedge compared with closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>). <B>Walking distance,</B> which is an indirect measurement of pain and function, improved after both opening and closing wedge high tibial osteotomy treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-11-18 05:07:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of osteotomy for OA of the knee. All studies reported on valgus high tibial osteotomy for medial compartment OA of the knee. Twenty-one studies were included in this updated review, and no studies compared osteotomy surgery versus non-operative treatment. Two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toksvig_x002d_Larsen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Toksvig-Larsen 2013</LINK>) examined also the effects of an osteotomy for lateral compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the risk of bias of included studies was high: The randomisation procedure frequently was not described or was insufficient. In most studies, blinding procedures were insufficient. We realise that it is difficult to blind the treatment provider in trials of surgical procedures. Blinding of the participant is difficult mainly because of postoperative scars. Moreover, use of radiological outcome measurements makes it difficult to conceal the type of surgical procedure performed. Some studies did not provide full data on outcome measures; measures of variability (such as standard deviation) were especially lacking (<LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myrnerts-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Myrnerts 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>), which makes quantitative analysis impossible. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, pooling of results was possible only for pain, function, serious adverse events and reoperation rate after a closing wedge high tibial osteotomy compared with another high tibial osteotomy technique.</P>
<P>Furthermore, for most trials, inclusion and exclusion criteria were briefly presented, and most did not have enough power to discern significant between-group differences. At last, for treatment of chronic disease such as knee OA, follow-up of most studies was relatively short: mean 1.8 years (range 0.2 to 7.5 years).</P>
<P>The primary goals of a high tibial osteotomy are to reduce pain and to improve function. Furthermore, this procedure may slow down the OA process, consequently postponing knee arthroplasty, although results seem to deteriorate over time, and an overall failure rate of 24% at 10 years has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Virolainen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virolainen 2004</LINK>). Performing total knee arthroplasty after high tibial osteotomy can be difficult because of valgus alignment, scarring of soft tissue with patella baja and bone stock/anatomical changes in the proximal tibia. Three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>) estimated outcomes such as patellar height, inclination angle of the tibia and condylar offset; this may influence the outcome of a total knee arthroplasty performed after a high tibial osteotomy. The opening wedge high tibial osteotomy showed a greater number of side effects for revision to future total knee arthroplasty compared with the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>). A combined osteotomy (opening and closing wedge) and high tibial osteotomy showed fewer anatomical changes of the knee postoperatively when compared with the closing wedge technique. Futhermore, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) can be used to produce more accurate correction of the osteotomy with less of an increase in the posterior tibial slope. This enhances anterior-posterior stability without increasing posterior contact pressure, especially in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees (<LINK REF="STD-Iori-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Iori 2011</LINK>). The high tibial osteotomy technique with an external fixator showed fewer side effects for revision to future total knee arthroplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>) but showed a significantly higher infection rate (pin track) (<LINK REF="STD-Adili-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adili 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>One review showed that in spite of anatomical changes after high tibial osteotomy, subsequent total knee arthroplasty did not compromise clinical outcomes when compared with primary knee arthroplasty, but additional strong evidence is needed (<LINK REF="REF-Raaij-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raaij 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timing of surgery and selection of a particular surgical procedure, especially high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement, are interesting to study. The literature shows that varus alignment causes progression of knee osteoarthritis of the medial compartment, and a correction osteotomy may affect this process (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2010</LINK>). The high tibial osteotomy is probably more applicable for the younger patient, to delay the OA process. Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty represents more of a final solution for the osteoarthritic knee, comparable with total knee arthroplasty. This is probably the reason why these two surgical treatments for unicompartmental osteoarthritis have been compared with each other less in randomised controlled trials; only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stukenborg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stukenborg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weidenhielm-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weidenhielm 1993</LINK>) are included in this review. At the moment, the tendency is for osteotomies to be performed less, and unicompartmental arthroplasties are gaining in popularity in the orthopaedic community. However, it is remarkable that this review shows no significant differences in pain scores and functional outcomes between these different surgical treatments, even in older patients, and orthopaedic surgeons must take care to avoid losing experience in this kind of treatment. Moreover so far, only one RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2009</LINK>) has compared total versus unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. A recently published database study showed no differences in score changes preoperatively and postoperatively between total and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 2012</LINK>), although survival of the total knee arthroplasty seems better (<LINK REF="REF-Koskinen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskinen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to several recent publications, the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy is increasing in popularity. Fixation with a fixed-angle device (plate with locking screws) is probably very important in opening wedge high tibial osteotomy. In one study, closing wedge high tibial osteotomy achieved significantly more accurate correction with less morbidity compared with the opening wedge technique using non-angular stable implants (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>). Another study using angular stable implants showed the opposite result (<LINK REF="STD-Luites-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luites 2009</LINK>). Moreover, the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy group showed a significant reduction in medial collateral knee laxity compared with the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy group (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>). In opening wedge high tibial osteotomy, there is no absolute necessity to use autologous bone graft to accelerate bone union (<LINK REF="STD-Zorzi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zorzi 2011</LINK>). Moreover, according to <LINK REF="STD-Harding-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 2011</LINK>, a single bisphosphonate infusion provided four weeks post osteotomy does not accelerate bone union.</P>
<P>Finally, early mobilisation of the knee joint postoperatively seems of imminent importance: Postoperative treatment with a cylinder plaster showed a significant reduction in range of motion (<LINK REF="STD-Odenbring-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Odenbring 1992</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-18 04:33:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment failure rate, which generally implicates revision to total knee prosthesis, was not an objective in all nine trials comparing different high tibial osteotomy techniques. In all included studies comparing different techniques of HTO, follow-up was too short for scoring of this outcome. Participants reported reduced pain after a high tibial osteotomy. On the basis of four studies comparing another type of high tibial osteotomy technique versus the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy, the mean pain score did not differ significantly between groups. Function according to knee score was measured in four studies. All of these studies showed improved knee function, but no statistically significant differences between groups were noted. Health-related quality of life outcomes improved after high tibial osteotomy, although this outcome was not measured in the included studies comparing different osteotomy techniques. Serious adverse events were rarely reported. Deep venous thrombosis was reported in three studies. Deep infection was reported in one study. Non-union of an opening wedge osteotomy was reported in one study. The reoperation rate were scored as early hardware removal caused by pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. These adverse events occurred significantly more often in participants undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with the closing wedge technique. Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement. Treatment failure, pain and function scores were not different after a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. More adverse events were described for the osteotomy group compared with the unicompartment knee replacement group. No studies compared osteotomy versus non-operative treatment.</P>

<P>The only robust conclusion regarding the objective of this review is that valgus high tibial osteotomy improves knee function and reduces pain. However, this conclusion is based on within-group comparisons. Other unconditional statements cannot be made. The main reasons for this are the limited numbers and heterogeneity of included studies with different types of interventions and outcome measures. Furthermore, the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate, and risk of bias for most items was high. Finally, in most studies, follow-up time was too short for treatment of a chronic disease such as knee osteoarthritis.</P>

<P>Quality of the evidence for most outcomes comparing different osteotomy techniques was downgraded to low because of the numbers of available studies, the numbers of participants and limitations in design. According to four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adili-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adili 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luites-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luites 2009</LINK>) comparing other types of high tibial osteotomy versus closing wedge high tibial osteotomy, the conclusion is that low-quality evidence shows no difference in pain after closing wedge high tibial osteotomy and other types of osteotomy. Low-quality evidence shows no difference in knee scores between different osteotomy techniques after one to two years of follow-up. Furthermore, low-quality evidence shows a higher reoperation rate after other types of high tibial osteotomy compared with the closing wedge technique (<LINK REF="STD-Adili-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adili 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999a</LINK>).

Acccording to two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>), low-quality evidence shows greater patellar descent after opening wedge osteotomy compared with closing wedge osteotomy, and very low-quality evidence shows less patellar descent with hemicallotasis opening wedge osteotomy compared with dome osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2001</LINK>). According to three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luites-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luites 2009</LINK>) determining postoperative alignment, moderate-quality evidence shows no differences between the closing and the opening wedge technique.</P>
<P>According to one study, very low-quality evidence shows that opening wedge high tibial osteotomy with computer-assisted navigation will result in more accurate correction and fewer side effects, such as increased tibial slope (<LINK REF="STD-Iori-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Iori 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, very low-quality evidence shows more optimal one-year postoperative correction after hemicallotasis osteotomy compared with closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Magyar-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Magyar 1999a</LINK>). In terms of medial collateral knee laxity, very low-quality evidence indicates that opening wedge high tibial osteotomy shows a significant reduction in medial collateral knee laxity compared with closing high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Gaasbeek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gaasbeek 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zorzi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zorzi 2011</LINK>), very low-quality evidence shows no additive effect of autologous bone graft in time to bone union for opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Zorzi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zorzi 2011</LINK>). According to another study (<LINK REF="STD-Harding-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Harding 2011</LINK>), very low-quality evidence shows no additive effect of bisphosphonate infusion post high tibial osteotomy in time to bone union.</P>
<P>When the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy is compared with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, very low-quality evidence shows no statistically significant differences in pain (<LINK REF="STD-Stukenborg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stukenborg 2001</LINK>) and no differences in gait analysis between these two surgical treatments for medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Weidenhielm-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weidenhielm 1993</LINK>).

<P>For differences in perioperative conditions, very low-quality evidence shows no supplementary postoperative effects of abrasion arthroplasty during high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Akizuki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akizuki 1997</LINK>); very low-quality evidence reveals no higher incidence of thrombosis with tourniquet during high tibial osteotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Motycka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Motycka 2000</LINK>); low-quality evidence shows that electromagnetic field stimulation leads to high tibial osteotomy healing (<LINK REF="STD-Mammi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mammi 1993</LINK>); and very low-quality evidence shows that use of a hinged cast brace after closing wedge high tibial osteotomy results in better range of motion compared with use of a postoperative plaster cast (<LINK REF="STD-Odenbring-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Odenbring 1992</LINK>). Very low-quality evidence indicates that computer-assisted navigation in open wedge osteotomy produces a more accurate correction (<LINK REF="STD-Iori-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Iori 2011</LINK>).

<P>Based on the results of 21 studies included in this review, we conclude that valgus high tibial osteotomy improves knee function and reduces pain. However, this conclusion is based on within-group comparisons, not on non-operative controls. It is unclear which technique we have to use because few statistically significant differences have been reported between different high tibial osteotomy techniques. Low-quality evidence shows no differences in the major outcomes of pain and function between closing wedge high tibial osteotomy and other types of osteotomy after one to two years of follow-up. Furthermore, low-quality evidence reveals a higher reoperation rate after other types of high tibial osteotomy compared with the closing wedge technique. The latest studies show that we probably have to use a fixed-angle device (plate with locking screws) for fixation of the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (this is associated with maintaining the correction).</P>
<P>When the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy is compared with the unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, very low-quality evidence shows no statistically significant differences between these two surgical treatments for medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis.</P>
<P>A large number of complications after osteotomy were reported, and no comparative evidence shows whether an osteotomy is more effective than non-operative therapy. However, significant postoperative improvement has been seen following osteotomy.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Large, high-quality studies are needed, with a focus on appropriate allocation concealment, blinding and adequate data presentation, including mean and standard deviation or 95% confidence intervals with risk of bias reduction analyses. The design and reports of future trials should comply with the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1996</LINK>). A single common international knee score should be agreed upon to make pooling of data possible.</LI>
<LI>Future research should examine the effects of treatments not only in trials comparing various interventions with each other, but also in more explanatory trials comparing interventions with conservative treatment.</LI>
<LI>Future research should focus on treating unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. A broad variety of treatments are available; most are costly, and data on their benefits are not available.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation of study groups with longer follow-up periods is necessary for treatment of a chronic disease such as knee osteoarthritis.</LI>
<LI>The literature shows that varus malalignment is a risk factor for osteoarthritis progression in the medial compartment of the knee. Correction osteotomy may affect this process. Future trials should measure delays in the osteoarthritis process and should determine the mechanisms.</LI>
<LI>Timing of surgery and choice of a particular surgical procedure, especially high tibial osteotomy versus unicompartmental knee replacement, are interesting to study.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We conclude that performing randomised studies of high methodological quality to examine the benefit of osteotomy compared with other frequently performed treatments for knee osteoarthritis is possible and necessary if high-quality evidence is to be obtained.</P>

<P>This is the second update of the original review, which was published in 2005, Issue 1. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for controlled trials in the first update until May 2007, and in the second update until November 2013.<BR/>
<BR/>As a result of the search strategy, two new studies and one longer follow-up study were included in the first update, and eight new studies were included in the second update of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>The two new studies in the first update compared two high tibial osteotomy techniques: the opening and the closing wedge during follow-up of one year. Functional outcome scores were not different, but the closing wedge achieved a more accurate correction with less morbidity.<BR/>
<BR/>The longer follow-up study presented five-year results when high tibial osteotomy was compared with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Both groups were improved after five years of follow-up, but no differences were noted between the two groups. In this update, the conclusions of the original review have not changed.</P>
<P>Three studies included in the second update compared two types of high tibial osteotomy. Two studies compared the closing and the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy, and one study compared the closing wedge high tibial osteotomy versus a combined high tibial osteotomy, including an opening and a closing wedge. Functional outcome scores and pain scores were not different. In one study, no difference in achieved postoperative correction angles was reported, but a significant reduction in medial collateral knee laxity was described after opening wedge high tibial osteotomy. In another included study, which compared opening and closing wedge high tibial osteotomies, the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy showed significantly more accurate correction. After a combined (opening and closing wedge) high tibial osteotomy, significantly smaller changes in patellar height and tibial slope were noted. Another five included studies compared different types of pin fixation in the hemicallotasis high tibial osteotomy technique, the healing effects of a single infusion of bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) four weeks post hemicallotasis osteotomy versus placebo, open-wedge high tibial osteotomy with and without navigation and opening wedge high tibial osteotomy with and without filling of the opening wedge with autologous iliac bone graft.</P>
