<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>This review sought to answer the question of whether antibiotics are effective in the treatment of LRTIs caused by the bacteria <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </I>(<I>M. pneumoniae</I>) in children.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>
<I>M. pneumoniae</I> is a bacterial infection, often responsible for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children. The infection can present in a number of different ways and the most common respiratory manifestations are acute bronchitis, pneumonia or wheezing. The illness is generally self limiting, with symptoms that can last several weeks but may (occasionally) also cause severe pneumonia. Antibiotics are often given to children with <I>M. pneumoniae</I> LRTI.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>We searched for trials published and pending as at July 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing either two types of antibiotic therapy or an antibiotic versus a placebo in children with pneumonia.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We identified seven studies (1912 children). Within each study, there were some children who had <I>M. pneumoniae </I>but we could not extract relevant data relating to efficacy or adverse events relating only to children with <I>M. pneumoniae. </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>Overall the quality of the evidence for each of the main outcomes is very low as there are insufficient data for any outcome. Hence, currently, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that antibiotics are effective in children with LRTI caused by <I>M. pneumoniae</I>.</P>

<I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</I> (<I>M. pneumoniae</I>) is widely recognised as an important cause of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children.

<P>
<I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </I>(<I>M. pneumoniae</I>) is widely recognised as an important cause of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children, accounting for 14% to 34% of cases (<LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michelow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelow 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Principi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2002</LINK>). The highest attack rates are reported to occur in five to 20-year olds and the infection is usually self limiting, with symptoms lasting several weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2003</LINK>). More recently, <I>M. pneumoniae </I>has been identified as an important cause of LRTI in children under five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Principi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2001</LINK>). Pulmonary manifestations are typically tracheobronchitis or pneumonia but can be complicated by pleural effusion, lung abscess, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis and respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Principi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2002</LINK>). <I>M. pneumoniae</I> is also implicated in wheezing episodes in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Principi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2001</LINK>). Uncommon extrapulmonary manifestations may include erythema multiforme, myocarditis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis and haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waites-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waites 2003</LINK>). Radiographic findings are quite variable and non-diagnostic (<LINK REF="REF-Principi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2001</LINK>). In some cases there can be significant radiological changes in the absence of clinical signs on auscultation of the chest (so-called 'walking pneumonia') (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-02 23:15:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics are frequently used to treat LRTIs and empiric antibiotic therapy is often chosen to cover both bacteria and atypical organisms (<LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>). A review of several major textbooks offers conflicting advice for management of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> LRTI. The chapter on <I>M. pneumoniae</I> in a paediatric respiratory textbook mentions that there is little evidence of beneficial effect from antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 1994</LINK>). This is in contrast to the recommendations in a major general paediatric textbook (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2003</LINK>), and paediatric infectious disease textbook (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1998</LINK>), which state that erythromycin is the treatment of choice.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-14 18:38:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of antibiotics in treating LRTI in children would be expected to reduce the severity or duration (or both) of the infection and its associated symptoms.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-02-15 16:21:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusion that antibiotics are effective in <I>M. pneumoniae </I>chest infections seems to have been drawn from trials of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired or atypical pneumonia, where <I>M. pneumoniae</I> was identified as a causative organism in a subgroup of cases. In these studies, macrolide antibiotics, to which <I>M. pneumoniae</I> is susceptible, have been compared to non-macrolide antibiotics. However, it is not always possible to draw meaningful conclusions from the results, as the numbers of individuals with <I>M. pneumoniae</I> are small in most trials (<LINK REF="STD-Block-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Block 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Identification of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection as the causative infectious agent may, however, pose difficulties. Serological tests are the most common method used to diagnose <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infections, but can lead to difficulties with interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Principi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2001</LINK>). Measurement of immunoglobulin M (IgM) is used to diagnose acute infection, but the accuracy of the test depends on the method used. Not all methods are specific for IgM and an elevated IgM may persist for months after the acute infection (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2003</LINK>). Immuno-fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay is more sensitive and specific than the complement fixation (CF) test (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Principi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Principi 2001</LINK>). Identification of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> in nasopharyngeal secretions by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may also cause difficulties with interpretation as this organism can persist for variable periods following the acute infection (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2003</LINK>). The 'gold standard' for diagnosis of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection is a four-fold increase in total antibody titre as measured in paired sera (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2003</LINK>).</P>

</P>
<P>We identified seven trials with 1912 children. The number of children from one study was unavailable (<LINK REF="STD-Soderstrom-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soderstrom 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data interpretation was significantly limited by the inability to extract data that specifically referred to children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by <I>M. pneumoniae</I>. There was only one study of children randomised to any antibiotic versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2005</LINK>). Most of the included studies comprised a subgroup of children who were randomised to a macrolide versus non-macrolide antibiotic. The total number of children in this subgroup was not known as the numbers were only available in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruhrmann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhrmann 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>).

There was a total of 26 in the azithromycin group and 12 in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gomez-Campdera-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez Campdera 1996</LINK> the rate of clinical cure was 95.12% in the azithromycin group and 90.41% in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group. Radiological improvement was noted in 90.6% of the azithromycin group. Adverse events were recorded in 11.25% of the azithromycin group and 17.14% in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group. <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1998</LINK> reported no difference in the rate of clinical cure at day 15 to 19 (67.2% versus 66.7%) and four to six weeks (85.1% versus 85.4%) in children randomised to azithromycin or amoxycillin-clavulanate. <I>M. pneumoniae</I> was identified in 16% (30 of 188 children under five years of age). Eradication of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> occurred in 3/3 in the azithromycin group and in 0/1 in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group. Adverse events in those children under five years of age were 12.1% in the azithromycin group and 42.3% in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group.</P>

In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>, which compared azithromycin to amoxicillin in children with classical pneumonia (eight children of 47 had <I>M. pneumoniae</I>), X-ray resolution was significantly better in those treated with azithromycin (81% versus 60.9% at day seven), but there was no difference in clinical symptoms or signs between groups.

<P>This review failed to find any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that specifically looked at the effectiveness of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) secondary to <I>M. pneumoniae</I>. There was only one study of antibiotics versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2005</LINK>), but this study defined success rates relative to LRTI secondary to <I>M. pneumoniae</I> and <I>Chlamydia</I> defined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or paired sera. In this study significantly more children in the azithromycin group had 'clinical success' on follow-up than the placebo group. From the other studies, in the subgroup of children with LRTI secondary to <I>M. pneumoniae</I> the intervention was a macrolide antibiotic versus a non-macrolide antibiotic, usually amoxycillin-clavulanate. This subgroup identified only 38 children with <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection and there were insufficient data to analyse the efficacy of macrolide antibiotics in this group. Adverse events were common: reported in 11% to 67% of children. The majority of adverse events related to the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia) and where reported were more common in younger children (under five years of age).</P>

<P>There were significant difficulties in interpreting the data from the included studies. Firstly, although all studies (except <LINK REF="STD-Soderstrom-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Soderstrom 1991</LINK>) enrolled children with LRTI, only a proportion had <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection. It was not possible to obtain information on the subgroup with <I>M. pneumoniae</I>. Secondly, the dose and type of antibiotics differed among studies. Thirdly, application of diagnostic criteria (serology versus PCR) varied and these are not necessarily interchangeable. Fourthly, the inclusion criteria differed (various types of LRTI manifestation) between studies. Furthermore, the outcomes measured were variable and in some papers clinical cure was undefined.</P>

<P>Based on a single randomised controlled trial (RCT), it is likely that macrolides are efficacious in (at least) a small group of children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) secondary to <I>M. pneumoniae.</I> However, there is insufficient evidence to draw any specific conclusions about the efficacy of antibiotics for this condition in children. The use of antibiotics for <I>M. pneumoniae</I> LRTI has to be individualised and balanced with possible adverse events associated with antibiotic use.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-02 23:42:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection is relatively common and its clinical manifestations range from being asymptomatic to death from its complications. As respiratory symptoms are the most common symptoms, there is a need for high quality, double-blinded RCTs to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for LRTI secondary to <I>M. pneumoniae</I> in children. Studies should consider the various clinical and microbiological diagnostic criteria of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> infection and utilise clear outcome criteria. Community studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rapid early diagnosis would be useful in evaluating the efficacy of antibiotics for<I> M. pneumoniae</I> for respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations, as well as for prevention of complications and microbiological clearance of <I>M. pneumoniae</I>.</P>

<LI>Inclusion criteria were children with clinically suspected pneumonia based on a radiological finding and the presence of tachypnoea. In addition patients had at least 1 of the following: fever or history of fever within 24 hours, cough, white cell count &gt;= 12,000/mm³, or chest findings suggestive of pneumonia</LI>
<LI>Exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to macrolides, penicillin or beta-lactam antibiotics, pregnancy or lactation, parenteral therapy required because of severe or multilobar pneumonia, treatment with any other systemic antibiotics within enrolment, evidence of underlying haematological, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, chronic steroid use or concomitant treatment with theophylline, carbamazepine, ergotamine, digitalis glycosides, terfenadine, loratadine or astemizole</LI>
<LI>Study was a multi-centre, parallel-group in which participants were randomised 2:1 to azithromycin or either amoxycillin-clavulanate if under 5 years and erythromycin if over 5 years. The method of randomisation was not described</LI>
<LI>Participants were blinded to therapy but there was no mention of blinding of clinicians or outcome assessors</LI>
<LI>There was a description of withdrawals or drop-outs. There was an assessment of compliance by comparing medication bottle weights at beginning and end of study. Participants were evaluated at 4 clinic visits: baseline; study days 2 to 5; study days 15 to 19; and 4 to 6 weeks post-therapy</LI>
<LI>Laboratory tests were obtained at baseline and on study days 15 to 19. Chest X-rays were obtained at baseline and 4 to 6 weeks post-therapy. Evidence of infection with <I>M. pneumoniae</I> was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and defined as either single positive serum IgM (&gt;= 1:10) or 4-fold increase in IgG titre</LI>
<LI>Clinical response at study days 15 to 19 was classified as: cure, complete resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia; improvement, incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia; failure, persistence (or progression) of signs and symptoms of pneumonia after 3 days of therapy or development of new clinical findings consistent with active infection or persistence (or progression) of radiological findings obtained when clinically indicated</LI>
<LI>Clinical response 4 to 6 weeks post-therapy was classified as follows: cure; complete resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia and improvement or resolution of radiographic findings; failure; persistence (or progression) of signs and symptoms of pneumonia after 3 days of therapy or development of new clinical findings consistent with active infection or persistence (or progression) of radiological findings</LI>
<LI>Bacteriological response was classified as follows: eradication (presumed or proven), elimination of the original organism from the same site during or after completion of therapy and includes cases where repeat specimens were nor obtained and patients considered a clinical cure or improved; persistence, failure to eradicate the organism and includes cases where specimens were not obtainable at the time alternative therapy was instituted and the patient was considered a clinical failure. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study by reported symptoms, physical examinations and laboratory tests.

<LI>Participants with a diagnosis of CAP were recruited from 1 January 1996 to 1 January 1999</LI>
<LI>Inclusion criteria were children with a clinical diagnosis of radiologically confirmed of presumed bacterial CAP, eligible for treatment with oral antibiotics and without signs of respiratory insufficiency</LI>
<LI>Exclusion criteria were history or evidence of chronic pathology of any organ system, chronic pulmonary disease, history of prematurity, treatment with any antibiotics within 5 days prior to enrolment, or known hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics or macrolides</LI>
<LI>The study population was divided into 2 groups according to clinical and radiological patterns. One group included those children who presented with signs of classic bacterial pneumonia, with high fever and chest findings of crackles or signs of consolidation, and chest X-rays with segmental, alveolar or lobar consolidation. The second group included patients with atypical pneumonia, with prominent and frequently paroxysmal cough, variable fever, few clinical signs of consolidation, crackles and wheezing, and chest X-rays with a mixed alveolar-interstitial pattern</LI>
<LI>Participants with classic pneumonia were randomised to either amoxycillin or azithromycin, whereas participants in the atypical pneumonia group were randomly assigned to either azithromycin or erythromycin. The method of randomisation was not described. There was no mention of blinding except for blinding of the radiologist who viewed follow-up chest X-rays done on study days 7 and 14. There was a description of withdrawals or drop-outs. There was no assessment of compliance</LI>
<LI>Outcomes were evaluated at 3 clinic visits, on study days 3, 7 and 14. A chest X-ray was done for each child on study days 7 and 14. Evidence of infection was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test sera for IgM antibodies to <I>M. pneumoniae</I>. An antibody titre &gt; 1:16 on a single first serum specimen was considered positive for indirect immunofluorescence.

<LI>Participants were recruited from an emergency clinic at the Children's Medical Centre Dallas, Texas with a diagnosis of CAP from February 1996 to December 1997</LI>
<LI>Inclusion criteria were children with tachypnoea, fever, cough or rales and an abnormal chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia and considered to have community-acquired infection</LI>
<LI>Exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to macrolides or beta-lactam antibiotics, pregnancy or lactation, nosocomial-acquired infections, hospitalisation, systemic antibiotic within 72 hours before enrolment, cefixime or ceftriaxone within the previous 7 days and chronic diseases. Participants were also excluded if they were receiving medications that had potential adverse interactions with erythromycin or azithromycin</LI>
<LI>Study participants were randomised to azithromycin or either amoxycillin-clavulanate if under 5 years and erythromycin if over 5 years. A list of randomised therapy assignments was used by research pharmacist to provide patients with either azithromycin, amoxycillin-clavulanate or erythromycin</LI>
<LI>There was no mention of blinding of participants, clinicians or outcome assessors, except the radiologists who reviewed all radiographs who were not familiar with the patient's clinical history or results of special studies. There was a description of withdrawals or drop-outs. There was an assessment of compliance by measuring the volume of drug in the bottle at the 2- to 5-week visit</LI>
<LI>Clinical evaluation occurred at enrolment, 2 to 3 days and 10 to 37 days after start of therapy. At day 2 to 3 a telephone call was made to the caregiver to assess symptoms, interventions and adverse reactions. Patients were assessed at weeks 2 to 5 for symptoms, adverse reactions and outcome. At this assessment bacteriological samples were collected - nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs for culture and PCR and serum for convalescent antibody titres. A chest X-ray was repeated only if a patient had signs of persistent or new infection. Clinical response was defined as: cure, resolution of all signs and symptoms; improvement, incomplete resolution of all signs and symptoms; and failure, persistence or progression after 3 days of therapy, new clinical findings suggesting active infection or death related to pneumonia. Bacteriological response was not defined. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Evidence of infection with <I>M. pneumoniae</I> was determined by serology (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and culture or PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Positive serology was defined as either single positive serum IgM (&gt;= 1:10) or 4-fold increase in IgG titre</LI>

<LI>174 children aged 6 months to 16 years with CAP were enrolled</LI>
<LI>6 patients were excluded because of normal chest X-rays. 21 children were excluded from clinical evaluation: 10 failed to return for follow-up examination and 11 did not complete treatment.

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 1), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2, 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2010).</P>
<P>We used the following search terms for MEDLINE and CENTRAL and adapted them for EMBASE. We combined the search terms used in MEDLINE with a sensitive search strategy for identifying child studies (<LINK REF="REF-Boluyt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boluyt 2008</LINK>) and the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (Lefebvre 2008).</P>
