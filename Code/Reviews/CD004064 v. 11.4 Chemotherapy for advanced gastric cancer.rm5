<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Of all people with gastric cancer, in countries where screening is not routinely performed, 80% to 90% are either diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumour is inoperable, or develop a recurrence within five years after surgery. Before starting any systemic chemotherapy in advanced disease, testing for over expression of the <U>H</U>uman <U>E</U>pidermal growth factor <U>R</U>eceptor-2 (abbreviated HER-2) testing is mandatory, and people with HER-2 over expression need, in the absence of contraindications, to be treated by a combination of a cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab (i.e. a monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor II).</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched biomedical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) until June 2016. We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 studies with 11,698 participants contained data on overall survival, in this review. We excluded 195 studies with reasons.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, depending on the comparison and outcome being assessed. Reasons for down grading the quality were due to risk of bias due to lack of blinded or independent radiological review, imprecision or heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Chemotherapy improves survival (by approximately 6.7 months) and quality of life in comparison to best supportive care alone, and first-line combination chemotherapy improves survival (by one month) compared to single-agent 5-FU.</P>
<P>The addition of docetaxel to platinum-fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimens appears to extend survival (by just over one additional month) at the cost of increased toxicity. Whether the benefit from adding a third drug (docetaxel or epirubicin) to a two-drug platinum-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy combination outweighs its toxicity is unclear.</P>
<P>Consideration of the profile of side effects and the impact of these side effects on the individual person's quality of life, as well as the tumour burden and necessity to obtain a response rapidly is therefore essential in the choice of the regimen. Additionally, irinotecan-containing regimens prolonged overall survival (by an additional 1.6 months) compared to non-irinotecan-containing regimens.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-14 06:27:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. In "Western" countries, most people are either diagnosed at an advanced stage, or develop a relapse after surgery with curative intent. In people with advanced disease, significant benefits from targeted therapies are currently limited to HER-2 positive disease treated with trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, in first-line. In second-line, ramucirumab, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, demonstrated significant survival benefits. Thus, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Uncertainty remains regarding the choice of the regimen.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-14 06:27:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-24 09:57:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 RCTs (11,698 participants) provided data for the meta-analysis of overall survival. We found chemotherapy extends overall survival (OS) by approximately 6.7 months more than BSC (hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.24 to 0.55, 184 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). Combination chemotherapy extends OS slightly (by an additional month) versus single-agent chemotherapy (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, 4447 participants, 23 studies, moderate-quality evidence), which is partly counterbalanced by increased toxicity. The benefit of epirubicin in three-drug combinations, in which cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU is replaced by capecitabine is unknown.</P>
<P>Irinotecan extends OS slightly (by an additional 1.6 months) versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, 2135 participants, 10 studies, high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Docetaxel extends OS slightly (just over one month) compared to non-docetaxel-containing regimens (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, 2001 participants, eight studies, high-quality evidence). However, due to subgroup analyses, we are uncertain whether docetaxel-containing combinations (docetaxel added to a single-agent or two-drug combination) extends OS due to moderate-quality evidence (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91, 1466 participants, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). When another chemotherapy was replaced by docetaxel, there is probably little or no difference in OS (HR 1.05; 0.87 to 1.27, 479 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). We found there is probably little or no difference in OS when comparing capecitabine versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11, 732 participants, five studies, moderate-quality evidence) .</P>
<P>Oxaliplatin may extend (by less than one month) OS versus cisplatin-containing regimens (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98, 1105 participants, five studies, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether taxane-platinum combinations with (versus without) fluoropyrimidines extend OS due to very low-quality evidence (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.06, 482 participants, three studies, very low-quality evidence). S-1 regimens improve OS slightly (by less than an additional month) versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00, 1793 participants, four studies, high-quality evidence), however since S-1 is used in different doses and schedules between Asian and non-Asian population, the applicability of this finding to individual populations is uncertain.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-17 14:37:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional 6.7 months) in comparison to BSC, and combination chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional month) compared to single-agent 5-FU. Testing all patients for HER-2 status may help to identify patients with HER-2-positive tumours, for whom, in the absence of contraindications, trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine or 5-FU in combination with cisplatin has been shown to be beneficial. For HER-2 negative people, all different two-and three-drug combinations including irinotecan, docetaxel, oxaliplatin or oral 5-FU prodrugs are valid treatment options for advanced gastric cancer, and consideration of the side effects of each regimen is essential in the treatment decision. Irinotecan-containing combinations and docetaxel-containing combinations (in which docetaxel was added to a single-agent or two-drug (platinum/5-FUcombination) show significant survival benefits in the comparisons studied above. Furthermore, docetaxel-containing three-drug regimens have increased response rates, but the advantages of the docetaxel-containing three-drug combinations (DCF, FLO-T) are counterbalanced by increased toxicity. Additionally, oxaliplatin-containing regimens demonstrated a benefit in OS as compared to the same regimen containing cisplatin, and there is a modest survival improvement of S-1 compared to 5-FU-containing regimens.</P>
<P>Whether the survival benefit for three-drug combinations including cisplatin, 5-FU, and epirubicin as compared to the same regimen without epirubicin is still valid when second-line therapy is routinely administered and when cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine is questionable. Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed survival benefits for the three-drug regimens is not large enough to be clinically meaningful as defined recently by the American Society for Clinical Oncology (<A HREF="Ellis 2014">Ellis 2014</A>). In contrast to the comparisons in which a survival benefit was observed by adding a third drug to a two-drug regimen at the cost of increased toxicity, the comparison of regimens in which another chemotherapy was replaced by irinotecan was associated with a survival benefit (of borderline statistical significance), but <I>without </I>increased toxicity. For this reason irinotecan/5-FU-containing combinations are an attractive option for first-line treatment. Although they need to be interpreted with caution, subgroup analyses of one study suggest that elderly people have a greater benefit form oxaliplatin, as compared to cisplatin-based regimens, and that people with locally advanced disease or younger than 65 years might benefit more from a three-drug regimen including 5-FU, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin as compared to a two-drug combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, a hypothesis that needs further confirmation. For people with good performance status, the benefit of second-line chemotherapy has been established in several RCTs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and pathogenesis</HEADING>
<P>With an estimated 1.3 million new cases in 2015, gastric cancer is currently the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-GBD-Cancer-Collaboration-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD Cancer Collaboration 2017</LINK>). Only approximately 25% of all people with gastric cancer have resectable disease at presentation. Stomach cancer incidence rates show substantial variation internationally, with endemic regions in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America (<LINK REF="REF-Ferro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 2014</LINK>). <I>Helicobacter pylori</I>, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia have been identified as important steps in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Correa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correa 1996</LINK>). Due to improvements in food conservation and diet, as well as eradication of <I>Helicobacter pylori</I>, gastric cancer incidence and mortality has steadily fallen in the last 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Peleteiro-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peleteiro 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast, a dramatic rise in cardial and gastroesophageal junction tumour incidence rates has been observed in middle-aged, male, white Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2001</LINK>). A proportion of these cases seems to be associated with Barrett's epithelium (intestinal metaplasia of the distal oesophagus), developing from chronic oesophageal reflux disease (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu_x002d_Williams-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu-Williams 1990</LINK>). Although it is difficult to determine whether these cancers are gastroesophageal junction tumours or distal oesophageal malignancies (<LINK REF="REF-Rusch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rusch 2004</LINK>), in clinical studies for advanced disease they are usually treated in the same manner.</P>
<P>Gastric cancer is a heterogenous disease entity, with major differences in growth patterns, differentiation, and molecular pathogenesis. More than 90% of stomach tumours are adenocarcinomas. While Lauren already in 1965 distinguished (<LINK REF="REF-Lauren-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauren 1965</LINK>) the <I>well-differentiated or intestinal type</I> and the <I>undifferentiated or diffuse-type</I>, the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification <LINK REF="REF-Bosman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosman 2010</LINK> differentiates the following five major histopathological subtypes: papillary, tubular, and mucinous adenocarcinoma, as well as poorly cohesive (with or without signet cells) and mixed carcinoma. While the first three types correspond to the former "well differentiated or intestinal type", the undifferentiated or diffuse type according to Lauren corresponds to the poorly cohesive type in the current classification.</P>
<P>While the intestinal type is more common in males, older age groups, and in high-risk geographic areas, diffuse-type carcinomas have a more equal male to female distribution, are more frequent in younger individuals, and have a more uniform geographic distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Crew-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crew 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauren-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauren 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munoz-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munoz 1968</LINK>). Ninety per cent of gastric cancers are sporadic. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is rare, with less than 3% of cases. According to a recently published landmark paper (<LINK REF="REF-TCGA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">TCGA 2014</LINK>), which describes the results of a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the following four molecular subtypes can be distinguished.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Tumours positive for Epstein&#8211;Barr virus, which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hyper methylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2).</LI>
<LI>Microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates.</LI>
<LI>Genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins.</LI>
<LI>Tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases.</LI>
</OL>
<P>While this classification has no impact in the choice of systemic treatment at present, it will provide a roadmap for patient stratification and development of targeted therapies in the future.</P>
<P>In contrast, the over expression of the <U>H</U>uman <U>E</U>pidermal growth factor <U>R</U>eceptor-<U>2</U> (HER-2), which is observed in 10% to 20% of the people, is clinically relevant today as it predicts a significant benefit from treatment with trastuzumab (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 2010</LINK>). Further details of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer have been reviewed recently by Wadhwa and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Wadhwa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadhwa 2013</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prognosis and management options</HEADING>
<P>Apart from endoscopic treatment for a minority of very small tumours, partial or complete gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is the only potentially curative therapy for gastric cancer. Stage I to IV M0 tumours are principally resectable (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2001a</LINK>). However, although surgery carries a high cure rate for stage IA and IB cancers, the results for stage IIIA and IIIB cancers are poor. Many people with advanced disease, especially stage IIIA/B, are technically inoperable. Results for both resectable and locally advanced gastric cancer may be improved by either perioperative (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ychou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ychou 2011</LINK>) or adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paoletti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoletti 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sakuramoto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakuramoto 2007</LINK>). Unfortunately, even after an apparently 'curative' gastrectomy, relapse rates in prospective studies remain in the range of 40% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Bonenkamp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonenkamp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Songun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Songun 2010</LINK>) in European studies. In the Western world, most people are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when the tumour is inoperable. People with inoperable, recurrent or metastatic tumours have a poor prognosis with a median survival time of three to five months without chemotherapy. Several small randomised studies have provided evidence that first-line chemotherapy improves survival in these people (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pyrh_x00f6_nen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pyrhönen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1996</LINK>), but benefit has to be weighed against treatment-related toxicities. Furthermore, second-line chemotherapy has shown to improve survival and quality of life in several recent randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>While a significant number of phase-III studies have studied the value of targeted therapies in advanced gastric cancer (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Lordick-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lordick 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtsu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtsu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohtsu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohtsu 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Satoh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Satoh 2014</LINK>), only three phase III studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilke-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wilke 2014</LINK>) have had positive results and impact on clinical practice:</P>
<P>According to the randomised phase III "TOGA" study (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 2010</LINK>), response rate, progression-free- and overall survival are greatly improved by adding the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to the combination of cisplatin and capecitabine in HER-2 positive gastric cancer, and introduced trastuzumab as a standard of care for HER-2 positive disease. This study changed the workup of all people with advanced gastric cancer since all people with advanced gastric cancer must now undergo HER-2 testing before the initiation of any chemotherapy and, in the absence of contraindications, be treated with trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or capecitabine in case of HER-2 over expression on IHC (IHC 3+, or IHC 2+/FISH+). All other treatment options discussed in this review (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, docetaxel, as well as the anthracycline-containing regimen ECF) are therefore valid only for people with HER-2 negative disease. Studies on combinations of other chemotherapies with trastuzumab are currently limited to phase II and cannot be recommended for this reason. Furthermore, the VEGF-receptor-targeting antibody ramucirumab, with or without chemotherapy, has been evaluated in two phase III studies as second-line treatment, and emerged as a new treatment option in this indication. Thus, despite this recent progress, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of people with advanced gastric cancer.</P>

<P>5-FU is not only the most important and extensively studied single agent in this disease, but it is part of most combination chemotherapy regimens as well. Its single-agent response rate is about 20%. Differences in effect and toxicity profile are the reasons for its application as continuous infusion. Oral capecitabine (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>) or S-1 (<LINK REF="STD-Ajani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ajani 2010</LINK>) may replace infusional 5-FU, thus avoiding the risk and inconvenience associated with portable pumps. Other single agents with relevant activities are cisplatin (<LINK REF="REF-Leichman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leichman 1991</LINK>) and anthracyclines (<LINK REF="REF-Preusser-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preusser 1988</LINK>). Furthermore, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and irinotecan have been evaluated in recent phase III studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Batran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Al Batran 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dank-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dank 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-15 12:47:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>5-FU, an antimetabolite, pyrimidine-antagonist and inhibitor of thymidilate-synthethase is the backbone of chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine that is selectively activated in tumour tissue by a three-step enzymatic conversion, S-1 another oral fluoropyrimidine. Cisplatin is an alkylan, which acts through induction of intra- and inter-strand crosslinks. The diamino-cyclohexane platinum derivative oxaliplatin also leads to the formation of DNA crosslinks, but they are not recognised by the intracellular mismatch repair system. Docetaxel, as well as paclitaxel are agents which inhibit depolymerization of micro tubuli. Irinotecan is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, thereby disrupting DNA replication and cell division. These drugs have major differences in their toxicity profile.</P>

<P>Due to limited information, we considered second-line therapy only in selected sensitivity analyses of first-line therapy where data were available.

As there was a large number of categories of different combination chemotherapy regimens and the number of relevant studies in each category was not known when writing the protocol, it was impossible to plan in advance the best way to compare directly the different categories of combination chemotherapies.

For each individual study, we extracted HRs and their variances. If the figures were not given directly, methods of indirect determination were used. HRs can be estimated (under some assumptions) from log rank Chi², from log rank P values, from observed to expected event ratios and from ratios of median survival times or time point survival rates (<LINK REF="REF-Machin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>). In several instances, medians and/or number of events had to be read from the graphs. If both medians and survival rates at fixed time points were given, the medians were preferred.

For more details of the included studies, please see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Approximately 50% of the study investigators provided further information. Data about survival and response rates were given in most publications. Information about second-line therapy was either reported in the text or provided by the authors only in a limited number of studies.</P>
<P>Twenty-three studies, which included 4447 participants, were included in the analysis of <B>comparison 2</B>, which is combination versus single-agent chemotherapy. In studies that included more than one single or combination chemotherapy arm, different arms were combined in the analysis as specified below. <B>Comparisons 3</B> and<B> 4</B> included 579 and 1147 participants in four and seven studies. <B>Comparison 5</B> included 10 studies with a total of 2135 participants and <B>comparison 6</B> includes at present overall survival data from eight studies including a total of 2001 participants. <B>Comparisons 7</B> and <B>8 </B>included 732 and 1105 participants from two and five studies, respectively. Two new <B>comparisons</B> (<B>9</B>) and (<B>10</B>) with 482 and 1793 participants from three and four randomised studies, respectively were added in the current update.</P>
<P>It should be noted that some studies may appear in more than one comparison if they meet relevant criteria for inclusion.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Median survival and response rates were the outcomes most commonly described in the included studies. The newer studies reported progression-free survival instead of time to progression. Toxicity was not always classified according to WHO or NCI-CTC and was reported in different ways (per number of participants, per number of cycles and only the worst toxicity per participant). A comparison across studies was therefore not possible. For this reason, the numbers of participants who discontinued treatment due to toxicity as well as the numbers of treatment-related deaths were analysed. Information about second-line therapies and secondary resectability was unavailable for most studies. Details are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

<P>According to the protocol, we excluded studies in which cross-over after failure was encouraged or planned. Information about second-line therapy was generally unavailable in most first-line studies. However, in some large recent studies full information about second-line therapy was provided after contacting the first author and a limited number of participants did in fact cross over in the second-line therapy. After discussion and balancing the loss of information when excluding these studies against the possible bias caused by a limited number of participants crossing over, we decided to include studies in which the number of participants who crossed over between study arms was less than 10% of the whole study population. Exclusion of these studies would have provoked a bias in favour of studies where less information was available.Two studies which have repeatedly been quoted in the literature are especially mentioned: <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1994</LINK> was excluded because of cross-over, as the research ethics committee had requested that chemotherapy had to be provided to participants upon request in the BSC group, and 12 of 30 participants in the BSC group finally received chemotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1993</LINK> was excluded since the allocation of participants was done by alternate allocation (information provided by author YSP). Several studies currently published as abstracts only were not included at this stage, because full information and final results were currently unavailable or were not provided after contacting the author or sponsor. They are classified as '<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>'. We excluded studies using oral 5-FU because of its varying bioavailability and unreliable effect. The landmark 'REAL-2' study (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>), which evaluated the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin as compared to cisplatin and of capecitabine as compared to 5-FU, was not included in this meta-analysis after discussion because it included participants with squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus (more than 10%), which were not eligible according to the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. We sought separate data on participants with adenocarcinoma only, but they were not provided by the study investigator. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Sadighi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sadighi 2006</LINK> could not be included in the meta-analysis of overall survival because published data for calculation of the hazard ratio is not sufficient at present, but data on the other outcomes were included. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Park-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2006</LINK> was not included in the comparison of docetaxel versus non-docetaxel-containing regimens because both study arms included a taxane. Thus, the analyses are essentially a comparison of docetaxel and paclitaxel. If further studies relevant for this comparison are published in the future, a separate comparison of paclitaxel versus docetaxel-containing regimens will be included in the meta-analysis.The studies <LINK REF="STD-Gubanski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gubanski 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Guimbaud-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guimbaud 2014</LINK> were excluded because of systematic cross-over between study arms.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Because of the different ways of reporting (per number of participants, per number of cycles or only the maximum toxicity per participant), grade I to IV toxicities can be compared only within, but not between studies. Overall, treatment-associated toxicities were higher in the combination chemotherapy arms, but this was usually not statistically significant. In contrast, the rate of treatment-associated deaths may be summarised across studies.

To avoid double-counting the irinotecan-treated population in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bouche-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bouche 2004</LINK>, we approximated a within-study hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.72) for the study's irinotecan-treated population (N = 45) and non-irinotecan-treated population (N = 89). Overall, the pooled hazard ratio of irinotecan-containing regimens compared to non-irinotecan containing regimens was 0.87 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), with low heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.86) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>), and corresponds to pooled median survival times of 11.3 and 9.7 months, with a small, but significant benefit for the irinotecan-containing regimens.

For these reasons, the results of this comparison can be considered as robust. Further sensitivity analyses were not performed due to the low number of studies.</P>
<P>Next, the HR for overall survival was separately investigated for studies with substitutive (i.e. studies in which another chemotherapy was substituted by irinotecan), additive (i.e. studies in which irinotecan was added to other chemotherapies), and other comparisons of irinotecan and non-irinotecan-containing regimens (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-24 10:00:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only randomised controlled studies were included in this meta-analysis. An exhaustive search for unpublished or ongoing material was performed to minimise publication bias. Sixty studies, with a total of 11,698 participants, have been included in the meta-analysis of overall survival. The meta-analyses of <B>comparisons 1 </B>(three studies, 184 participants) <B>and 2</B> (23 studies involving 4447 participants) provide evidence for significant benefits in overall survival for first-line chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC), as well as a smaller benefit for combination versus single-agent chemotherapy. Overall, regimens containing irinotecan demonstrated improved results for overall survival in the <I>substitutive</I> comparison (i.e. where another chemotherapy was substituted by irinotecan) of irinotecan versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens (six studies with 826 participants, HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00, high-quality evidence), but not in the additive comparison (i.e. where irinotecan was added to another chemotherapy; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.03, three studies with 500 participants, low-quality evidence). In contrast, the meta-analysis of all irinotecan-containing versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens demonstrates a small, but significant survival benefit in favour of the people treated with irinotecan. Of note, both treatment-related deaths and treatment-discontinuation due to toxicity were not increased for people treated with irinotecan.</P>
<P>Furthermore, regimens in which docetaxel was added to a two-drug platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination showed a significant survival benefit (four studies with 1466 participants (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91, moderate-quality evidence). In contrast, substituting another chemotherapy (e.g. 5-FU (<LINK REF="STD-Ridwelski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ridwelski 2008</LINK>), epirubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Roth-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2007</LINK>), or both epirubicin and 5-FU (<LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2005</LINK>)) by docetaxel provides no advantage - either in survival, or in secondary outcomes (three studies involving 479 participants, HR 1.05; 0.87 to 1.27, moderate-quality evidence). However, the addition of docetaxel to a two-drug chemotherapy regimen in first-line therapy slightly increases both the risk of treatment-related deaths and treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. The comparison of regimens including capecitabine versus 5-FU showed non-significant advantages in terms of overall survival for the oral 5-FU prodrug capecitabine (732 participants in five studies, 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>The comparison of regimens including oxaliplatin versus cisplatin (<B>comparison 8</B>), and S-1 versus 5-FU (<B>comparison 10</B>), however demonstrated the superior efficacy of oxaliplatin (1105 participants from five studies, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98, low-quality evidence) and S-1 (1793 participants in four studies, HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00, high-quality evidence), respectively, the latter being statistically non significant. However the magnitude of the benefit in individual populations is unclear due to differences in dosing and treatment schedules, and drug metabolism of S-1 between Asian and Caucasian populations. Of note, the landmark REAL-2 study could not be included in this analysis as it included up to 13% of people with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the different study arms.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) First-line chemotherapy versus best supportive care</HEADING>
<P>Results for the comparison of first-line chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC) convincingly demonstrate a benefit in median survival in favour of chemotherapy (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.55, three studies, 184 participants, moderate-quality evidence), corresponding to 11 versus 4.3 months weighted average survival. The validity of this result was limited by the small number of participants included in this analysis. In two of four studies addressing this question, either the randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Murad-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Murad 1993</LINK>) or the study (<LINK REF="STD-Pyrh_x00f6_nen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pyrhönen 1995</LINK>) were terminated early. In another one (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>) the conduct of the study was not possible as planned because the research ethics committee requested the provision of chemotherapy upon request in the BSC group. Further studies addressing this comparison cannot be carried out as BSC cannot be considered to be an appropriate control arm for further studies. Exclusion of the studies by Murad and Pyrhönen, both of which have severe methodological limitations as described above, restricts the studies eligible for this analysis to the study by Scheithauer (<LINK REF="STD-Scheithauer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Scheithauer 1996</LINK>). This study, which included 103 participants, was the largest of all studies performed for this comparison and demonstrated a survival benefit of 10.2 versus 5.0 months in the chemotherapy versus BSC group (P = 0.0001), which is statistically significant and in line with the results of the other two studies, although not as large. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>), which was excluded from the analysis (see above) because of cross-over, provided important insights about the quality of life of participants in the chemotherapy and BSC arms. The average quality-adjusted survival was longer in the group of participants randomised to chemotherapy than in the BSC group (median six versus two months). In addition to the benefits in median survival and quality of life, between 10% and 24% of all participants in the chemotherapy groups in these three studies were alive after two years. In contrast, only one of 81 participants included in the BSC arms of these studies survived longer than 24 months. Two-year survival rates in chemotherapy-treated participants between 5% and 14% were confirmed by other authors (<LINK REF="REF-Ohkuwa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohkuwa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 1999</LINK>), confirming the observation that a limited number of people do have a considerably greater survival benefit from chemotherapy. The reason for the difference in pooled median survival between chemotherapy arms in the studies that compared chemotherapy versus BSC (11.0 months) and the combination therapy arms in studies comparing single-agent versus combination chemotherapy (7.0 months) remains unclear and cannot be explained by differences in prognostic factors. Considering the small number of participants included in the studies comparing chemotherapy versus BSC, as well as the methodological limitations in two of these three studies, an over-estimation of the effect of chemotherapy in these studies is likely.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Single agent versus combination chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Regarding <B>comparison 2,</B> 16 of 23 relevant individual studies (N = 4447) did not demonstrate a benefit in terms of overall survival for the combination chemotherapy arms. In this context, the results of this meta-analysis demonstrate a statistically significant and consistent benefit for combination versus single-agent therapy in terms of overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, response rate and time to progression show advantages for the participants treated with combination chemotherapy. The pooled results of these studies represent a generalised estimate of the effectiveness of the combination chemotherapy regimens used in the last 25 years. Therefore, the benefit of a modern two-drug combination, such as 5-FU/irinotecan or 5-FU/oxaliplatin over a single-agent, usually fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen is likely to exceed this global result.</P>
<P>Although any potential survival benefit associated with combination chemotherapy is achieved at the price of increased toxicity, the toxicity of the above mentioned combinations of 5-FU and irinotecan, and 5-FU and oxaliplatin is well managed by oncologists today. Furthermore, given the known correlation between tumour response and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Sadighi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sadighi 2006</LINK>), and considering that the ability of a chemotherapy to maintain a person's health-related quality of life is correlated to its efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Batran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Batran 2010</LINK>), in the absence of contraindications, modern two-drug combination chemotherapy regimens as discussed above should clearly be the preferred option for first-line treatment of people with advanced gastric cancer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(3) 5-FU/cisplatin/anthracycline combinations versus 5-FU/cisplatin (without anthracyclines)</HEADING>
<P>This comparison was based on 579 participants in four randomised studies and results in a HR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.89, moderate-quality evidence) in favour of the three-drug combination. This comparison is limited by a small number of studies and participants. The results of this comparison are predominantly attributable to the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2002</LINK>, which compared ECF versus MCF. The difference between the data included in this review and the final publication is due to the fact that the original publication included people with squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus, which do not correspond to the inclusion criteria of this review. Therefore, data from people with gastric adenocarcinoma only as provided by the authors were included in this review.</P>
<P>Whether these results are still relevant today is questionable for two reasons.</P>
<P>1) Since the publication of the REAL-2 study (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>), which demonstrated a significant survival benefit for the combination of EOX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine) as compared to ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil), cisplatin is frequently replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine in clinical practice. The relative contribution of epirubicin to the efficacy of the three-drug regimen of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and epirubicin must be considered as unclear.</P>
<P>2) All studies included in this comparison were conducted at a time when active drugs for second-line chemotherapy were not available. Thus, the validity of these results in 2017, after the publication of 3 randomised studies comparing second-line therapy versus BSC (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK>), which all three demonstrated as clinically meaningful, statistically significant, and consistent benefit in survival of about 1.5 months, as well as improvements in clinical symptoms <LINK REF="STD-Thuss_x002d_Patience-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Thuss-Patience 2011</LINK> and quality of life <LINK REF="STD-Ford-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 2014</LINK>, needs to be questioned.</P>
<P>In addition, a recently published, french randomised multicentre phase III study <LINK REF="STD-Guimbaud-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guimbaud 2014</LINK>, in which a total of 416 participants were included, is of special interest in this context. This study compared the combination of FOLFIRI, followed by ECX (epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine) with the reverse sequence of the same regimens. It has not been included in this meta-analysis as all participants eligible for second-line chemotherapy were systematically crossed over. The results of this study showed similar results for PFS (5.3 versus 5.8 months) and OS (9.5 versus 9.7 months) for both treatment strategies, but a longer time-to treatment-failure for FOLFIRI. Furthermore, the tolerance of FOLFIRI (overall grade III+IV toxicities and haematological adverse events) was better. For these reasons it must be considered as questionable whether the benefit from adding epirubicin to a two-drug regimen including capecitabine and oxaliplatin outweighs its additional toxicity, especially in sequential treatment strategies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(4) 5-FU/cisplatin/anthracycline-combinations versus 5-FU/anthracycline combinations (without cisplatin)</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Comparison 4</B> was based on 1147 participants randomised in seven studies and resulted in a HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.92; low-quality evidence, <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) in favour of the three-drug combination. A sensitivity analysis according to the quality score with inclusion of only those studies in which allocation concealment was adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Cocconi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cocconi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cocconi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cocconi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 1997</LINK>) does not cause a relevant change of the resulting HR (0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, low-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was non-significant in <B>comparison 3 and 4</B> (P = 0.71 and 0.21; I² was 0% (95% CI 0% to 26.5%) and 28.5% (95% CI 0% to 69.2%).</P>
<P>This comparison, which included a greater number of participants and studies compared to <B>comparison 3</B>, and is thus much more robust, confirms a statistically significant advantage in overall survival for the addition of cisplatin to the combination of epirubicin and fluorouracil, achieved at the price of increased toxicity. Again, all studies included in this comparison were published more than 20 years ago, when second-line therapy was unavailable. Therefore, as discussed above, the benefit of anthracyclines in this three-drug combination today is unclear. In view of the evidence discussed above, combinations of 5-FU/cisplatin and an anthracycline are no longer considered as a preferred option for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer today.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(5) Irinotecan versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Comparison 5</B> was based on 2135 participants randomised in 10 studies including six studies in substitutive comparisons, three studies in additive comparison, and two other comparisons. Two treatment arms without irinotecan (5-FU as single-agent and 5-FU/cisplatin) were compared to FOLFIRI in <LINK REF="STD-Bouche-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bouche 2004</LINK>. Taking all studies into account, the pooled hazard ratio was 0.87 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, high-quality evidence) in favour of irinotecan-containing regimens. In subgroup analyses of overall survival, the pooled HR were 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00, high-quality evidence) for the substitutive comparison, HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.03, low-quality evidence) for the additive comparison, and HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.00, very low-quality evidence) for the other comparisons, <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Objective response rates of 38% versus 30% were observed in substitutive (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.50, low-quality evidence) and 38% versus 22% in additive comparisons (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.80, low-quality evidence). The pooled HR for progression-free survival was 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.84, high-quality evidence); and 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.00, moderate-quality evidence) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.84, high-quality evidence) for subgroup analysis of substitutive and other comparisons, respectively. Results for rates of treatment-related deaths and treatment discontinuation due to toxicity showed high heterogeneity between studies.</P>
<P>In view of these results, 5-FU/irinotecan-based two-drug combinations should be considered as a true and at least equally effective alternative to platinum-based combinations in first-line therapy. A further advantage of the irinotecan-based combination is the different toxicity profile with no neurotoxicity (as compared to the platinum derivatives) and no significant renal toxicity. In addition, irinotecan-based regimens can easily be administered in the outpatient setting and avoid the hyperhydration necessary for the treatment with cisplatin. Again, the above mentioned study <LINK REF="STD-Guimbaud-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guimbaud 2014</LINK> clearly demonstrates not only the comparable results of treatment with FOLFIRI in first- versus second-line, but as well the feasibility of second-line chemotherapy in 40% to 50% of people and third-line in about 20% of people in Europe.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(6) Docetaxel versus non-docetaxel-containing regimens</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Comparison 6</B> was based on 2001 participants randomised in eight studies including three studies in substitutive comparisons, four studies in additive comparison, and one study in other comparisons. Results from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sadighi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sadighi 2006</LINK>) are not included in this meta-analysis at present because data for the calculation of the HR were not available. Overall, heterogeneity was not significant in the former two comparisons (I² = 0%, P = 0.99 and 0.82). Of special interest is the fact that studies, in which docetaxel was added to a two-drug regimen of a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Batran-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Batran 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2016;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK>) or S-1 as single-agent (<LINK REF="STD-Koizumi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Koizumi 2014</LINK>) demonstrate a significant benefit not only in terms of survival (HR 0.80; 0.71 to 0.91, moderate-quality evidence), but also in terms of response rates where the OR was 1.83 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.32, high-quality evidence) for the regimens with docetaxel. In contrast, when docetaxel is substituting another chemotherapy, such as 5-FU, no OS benefit of the docetaxel-containing chemotherapy regimen was observed (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, moderate-quality evidence). Thus, docetaxel-containing two-drug regimens are less efficient than docetaxel-containing three-drug regimens. This observation is confirmed by the recently published, randomised phase II study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2015</LINK>, where overall survival was 14.59 months (95% CI:11.7 to 21.78) for participants treated with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU, as compared to 11.3 (95% CI 8.08 to 14.03) months. However, survival was only a secondary endpoint of this study, and the study was not powered to detect survival differences. Of note, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK> 32% and 41% of participants in both study arms were treated with further chemotherapy lines, while this figure was not given for the study by <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Batran-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Batran 2013</LINK>. The positive effect of the addition of docetaxel to the cisplatin/fluorouracil combination on survival as well as the time to 5% deterioration of global health status in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK> was unfortunately achieved at the price of significant toxicity, especially haematological toxicity. For this reason, the clinical value of this regimen is regarded as controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Ilsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilsen 2007</LINK>). Of note, grade III to IV infection (related to treatment) was more frequent in elderly people (20% versus 9%), and infection was the main cause of treatment-related deaths in both study arms.</P>
<P>Finally, the median age of 55 in the participants included in this study, which was well below the median age of the participants included in other studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Al-Batran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Al Batran 2008</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>: 64 and 65 years), needs to be considered when applying these findings to people outside a clinical study. In contrast, the FLOT regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) was developed in an elderly population (median age 69 and 70 years in both treatment groups) (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Batran-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Batran 2013</LINK>). The primary endpoint of this randomised phase II study, which compared FLOT with FLO (5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) was the tolerability and feasibility, defined as per group differences in toxic effects. While the results of this study show - as expected - higher rates of neutropenia, leukopenia, alopecia, and diarrhoea for the participants treated with FLOT, there were similar rates of complicated neutropenia and serious adverse events in the two treatment arms. However, progression-free and overall survival in people over 70 years was similar for treatment with FLOT and FLO. Thus, although FLOT has shown to be feasible in a population over 65 years old, according to a subgroup analysis of younger participants (n = 68) versus equal to or older than 70 years (n = 75) in this study, only in participants younger than 70 an improved survival was observed for the three-drug combination (median survival 7.1 versus 10.6 months). However, these data are not more than hypothesis generating based on a subgroup analysis from a randomised phase II study. Nevertheless, although the same limitation is valid, another subgroup analysis from this study, which compared the benefit of FLOT to FLO in people with locally advanced versus metastatic disease raised another interesting hypothesis. According to this subgroup analysis, median survival of people with locally advanced disease (n = 44) treated with FLOT versus FLO is 24.2 versus 10.3 months, as compared to 7.3 versus 6.0 months in people with metastatic disease (n = 99). Thus, people with locally advanced disease might have a greater benefit from FLOT than people with metastatic disease.</P>

<B>Comparison 7 </B>was based on 732 randomised participants in five studies and resulted in a HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). The finding of these studies are in line with the study by <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>, which confirms the non-inferiority of capecitabine as compared to 5-FU although it was not included in this comparison because of differences in the participant population (inclusion of people with squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus). For this reason, people with gastric cancer without dysphagia, with adequate renal function and compliance may be treated with capecitabine (or S-1 - see <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>) instead of 5-FU.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(8) Regimens including oxaliplatin versus the same regimen including cisplatin</HEADING>
<P>Overall survival results for <B>comparison 8</B> are based on 1105 randomised participants in five studies. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.98, low-quality evidence) showing a statistically significant survival advantage in favour of oxaliplatin-containing regimens (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). A higher rate of tumour response was also observed in oxaliplatin-containing regimens (54%) compared to cisplatin-containing regimens (47%) (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76, moderate-quality evidence). Again, although data from the landmark REAL-2 study (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>) were not included in this comparison for reasons specified above, they confirm the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin as compared to cisplatin. It is worth noting that three of these included studies were conducted in Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Hironaka-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Hironaka 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamada-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 2015</LINK>), potentially highlighting the applicability of these results to an Asian cohort.</P>
<P>Of special interest in this context is a subgroup analysis of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Al-Batran-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Al Batran 2008</LINK>, which reports better results for elderly participants treated with oxaliplatin as compared to cisplatin. Therefore, especially when taking into account the higher response rates and lower risk of treatment-related death, oxaliplatin should be preferred to cisplatin in the treatment of gastric cancer.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">9) Taxane-platinum-fluoropyrimidine combinations versus taxane-platinum (without fluoropyrimidine)</HEADING>

The potential drawback was the higher rate of treatment-related deaths (6.2% versus 2.6%, OR 1.95; 95% CI 0.73 to 5.17) and treatment discontinuation due to toxicity (17% versus 11%, OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.69) in the regimens with fluoropyrimidines. Of note; these results are partially attributable to the docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine-combination, which due to its clearly inferior therapeutic index as compared to the same combination with 5-FU instead of capecitabine (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2015</LINK>) is not recommended. However, objective response rates (38% versus 23%, 2.08 (95% CI CI 1.37 to 3.15) and progression-free survival (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93, moderate-quality evidence) were improved in regimens with fluoropyrimidine. Treatment burden increased over time in both treatment arms. Thus, in conclusion, when a docetaxel-containing three-drug combination chemotherapy regimen is chosen as first-line treatment, oxaliplatin should be preferred to cisplatin, and 5-FU should be preferred to capecitabine.</P>

<P>This comparison was based on 1793 randomised participants in four studies and resulted in a HR for overall survival of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.00; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). In addition, a statistically significant advantage in tumour response (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94, very low-quality evidence), a numerical benefit in progression- free-survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04) and time-to-treatment failure (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01, both low-quality evidence), less frequent treatment-related deaths (1.5% versus 2.7%, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.06), and treatment discontinuations due to toxicity (11.1% versus 12.8%, OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.13) were observed in the S-1-containing compared to the 5-FU-containing arms.</P>

<P>In most of these studies, the participants were only in part representative of all people with gastric cancer because they were generally younger than the overall population of people with gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Pye-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pye 2001</LINK>). People with co-morbidities, such as renal or cardiac disease, were excluded. For this reason, these findings are only applicable to people who fulfil the inclusion criteria of these studies and cannot be generalised to all people with gastric cancer. The number of studies representing Asian people with gastric cancer in this 2017 updated review has increased considerably, with now a total of 26 studies conducted at least in part in Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Boku-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Boku 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dong-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hironaka-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Hironaka 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikuchi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kikuchi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koizumi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Koizumi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koizumi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Koizumi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Komatsu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Komatsu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-KRGGC-1992" TYPE="STUDY">KRGGC 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Narahara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Narahara 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishikawa-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nishikawa 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtsu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtsu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shirao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shirao 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugimoto-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sugimoto 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamada-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamura-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamura 1998</LINK>). The largest number of Asian people was included in comparison 2. Asian people were clearly underrepresented in comparisons 3, 4, and 6. The example of S-1, which is used in different doses in Caucasian (25 mg/m² twice daily) and Asian people (40 mg/m² twice daily) (<LINK REF="STD-Satoh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Satoh 2014</LINK>) confirms that chemotherapy regimens need to be tested in Asian and Caucasian populations separately, and that the balance between efficacy and toxicity of a given regimen might be different in different populations due in part to genetic differences (<LINK REF="REF-Syn-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syn 2015</LINK>). Results from clinical studies are thus applicable only to those populations where they have been tested. Except for these limitations, the evidence cited above should be regarded as complete and applicable.</P>

<P>This review included a total of 60 studies and 11,698 participants in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome of overall survival. Seven of the 10 main comparisons for overall survival had low heterogeneity (I² &lt; 20%), and even among comparisons with higher levels of inconsistency (I² &gt; 20%), the amount of heterogeneity present was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). Hence, the pooled results can be considered to be relatively stable. The majority of studies had low risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, blinding, incomplete efficacy or safety outcome data, and selective reporting. However, the risk of bias due to lack of independent or blinded radiological review and other sources of bias (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) are unclear or high in more than 50% of included studies; hence, these can be considered areas for improvement in future studies. The main reasons for downgrading of evidence in the 'Summary of findings' tables are due to lack of precision in pooled effect sizes, risk of bias (particularly, allocation bias), and statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>For this review, all reasonable effort has been made to reduce and address potential sources of bias, such as inclusion of studies not published in English, searches for unpublished and not fully published studies. Therefore, the likelihood that relevant studies have not been identified is considered as small. One factor with known impact on overall survival after first-line chemotherapy is second-line therapy, which is administered in up to 70% of some recent studies. However, as second-line therapy is now a standard of care, it should not be considered as a source of bias.</P>

<P>Another meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Okines-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okines 2008</LINK>), which summarised the results from two studies that used capecitabine instead of 5-FU, confirmed a significant survival benefit for the people treated with capecitabine, thus lending further support to the use of capecitabine in people with gastric cancer.</P>
<P>We agree with the following key issues in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Garrido-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrido 2014</LINK>: DCF is - in terms of efficacy - one of the most promising regimens in younger people with adequate general health.

However, we would strongly advise not to use IFL (a combination of bolus 5-FU and irinotecan) in view of the higher rate of treatment-related deaths of this regimen in colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 2004</LINK>)<B>. </B>The conclusions of the review by <LINK REF="REF-Lordick-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lordick 2014b</LINK> "both doublet and triplet drug-regimens can be used.....but careful consideration of the potential toxic complications, impairment of the person's quality of life, and the relative benefit should be undertaken". <LINK REF="REF-Lordick-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lordick 2014a</LINK> gives an excellent, more general overview of the current status and challenges in gastric cancer treatment.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-15 12:47:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review found that people with advanced gastric cancer would benefit from being tested for HER-2 over expression, and in the absence of contraindications receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or capecitabine in case of HER-2 positive disease. For all other people, the use of combination chemotherapy could be considered as standard of care for first-line treatment. The results of this meta-analysis suggest a significant and conclusive survival benefit for chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC), as well as a modest survival benefit for combination versus single-agent chemotherapy. As many studies included in this comparison have used combination chemotherapy regimens with suboptimal efficacy, such as 5-FU/epirubicin or 5-FU/ cisplatin, the benefit of combination chemotherapy is likely to be underestimated. In the absence of contraindications, the upfront use of a two-drug combination is efficacious. Among the combination chemotherapy regimens, two-drug combinations including a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin is more efficacious than cisplatin-based combinations in view of their survival benefit and reduced risk of treatment-related deaths. 5-FU/irinotecan-based two-drug combinations are an alternative to platinum-based regimens for first-line treatment, which demonstrated superior results for survival, as well as progression-free survival and tumour response, without any negative impact on toxicity as compared to the non-irinotecan-containing combination chemotherapy regimens. Thus, based on both their efficacy and the balance between efficacy and toxicity, two-drug combinations of a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin or 5-FU and irinotecan are superior treatment regimens for first-line treatment of HER-2 negative gastric cancer. Consideration of the side-effect profile of each regimen is essential in the treatment decision for an individual person.</P>
<P>Three-drug combinations are not widely-used in clinical practice, but might be beneficial for individual people: Two major groups of three-drug-combinations need to be discussed:</P>
<P>1. Docetaxel-based three drug combinations (DCF, FLO-T or TEF).</P>
<P>In which docetaxel is added to a single-agent or two-drug (platinum/5-FU- combination) show significant advantages in terms of overall survival, progression-free-survival, and response rates. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by increased toxicity, especially hematological and neurotoxicity. Of note, while the DCF regimen has been evaluated in a population with a median age of 55 years (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK>) with greater toxicity in the elderly people included in this study, it cannot be recommended for elderly people and for this reason FLOT has been shown to be feasible in people over 65 (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Batran-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Batran 2013</LINK>). However, in this randomised phase II study conducted in Germany, no benefit from treatment with the three-drug combination of docetaxel, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin (FLOT) as compared to the two-drug regimen FLO (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) was observed in people aged 70 years or older. In the age of personalised medicine, we should not only ask which regimen is better, but which regimen is better for which people. In the above mentioned study by Al-Batran, the benefit from the three-drug combination was limited to people under 70 years old and a small group of people with locally advanced (versus metastatic) disease. Although data from a subgroup analysis need to be interpreted with caution and the validity of these findings needs to be confirmed in future studies, this is an intriguing hypothesis. Of note, in the perioperative setting an increased pathological response rate was demonstrated for the use of FLOT - as compared to ECF- in a recent publication (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Batran-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Batran 2016</LINK>), although survival results are still pending.</P>
<P>2. Three-drug regimens which include epirubicin.</P>
<P>Whether the survival benefit for three-drug combinations including cisplatin, 5-FU, and epirubicin - as compared to the same regimen without epirubicin - is still valid when second-line therapy is routinely administered and when cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine is questionable.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed survival benefits for both groups of three-drug combinations in the palliative setting is not large enough to be clinically meaningful as defined recently by the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2014</LINK>). In contrast to comparisons, in which a survival benefit was observed by adding a third drug to a two-drug regimen at the cost of increased toxicity, the comparison of regimens in which another chemotherapy was replaced by irinotecan was associated with a survival benefit (of borderline statistical significance) <I>without </I>increased toxicity.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, individual people in good performance status and with a large tumour burden might have a greater advantage from three-drug regimens (especially docetaxel-containing three-drug combinations) due to their higher response rate.</P>
<P>The benefit of second-line chemotherapy in terms of symptom relief and survival over BSC has been demonstrated in several well-conducted and randomised studies in both European and Asian populations, in people with good performance status. Routine administration of second-line therapy to all people with good performance status might further limit the benefit of a three-drug combination upfront, as compared to the sequential administration of doublets followed by a single-agent, as recently shown in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Guimbaud-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Guimbaud 2014</LINK>. According to recent phase III studies, the vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-receptor-targeting antibody ramucirumab (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilke-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wilke 2014</LINK>) as single-agent treatment or in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy might be considered as an alternative to chemotherapy alone as second line.</P>
<P>According to a randomised study among patients with metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer, early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood. As compared to patients receiving standard care, patients receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life, but longer survival (<LINK REF="REF-Temel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temel 2010</LINK>). According to their most recent update, ASCO guidelines on "Integration of palliative care into standard oncology care" (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrell-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrell 2017</LINK>) recommend that - for newly diagnosed people with advanced cancer - the specialised palliative care team should be involved within eight weeks of diagnosis. Among people with high symptom burdens, outpatient care programs should deliver palliative care services to complement existing program tools. For elderly people, the use of a minimum dataset including the Charlson Comorbidity Index (<LINK REF="REF-Charlson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charlson 1987</LINK>), the G8 geriatric assessment screening tool, and the instrumental activities of daily living should be considered for the assessment of global health status and functional status (<LINK REF="REF-Pallis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallis 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, it should be noted that despite all progress in the last decades, advanced gastric cancer remains a disease with a dismal prognosis, and median survival exceeding 12 months only in a small number of randomised studies. Thus, appropriate treatment measure should follow the guidelines of palliative care, defined by WHO (<LINK REF="REF-Sepulveda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepulveda 2002</LINK>) as "an approach that improves the quality-of-life of people and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness".</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-15 12:47:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is necessary to develop specific treatment strategies for the different subtypes of gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-TCGA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">TCGA 2014</LINK>). This concerns not only the molecular subtypes described above, but also clinically defined subgroups of people, for example people with locally advanced or limited metastatic disease, as well as a radiological response to chemotherapy. Considering systemic treatment alone in all people with locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer is unlikely to achieve the best results for these subgroups with favourable prognostic factors: People with a radiological response in the REAL-2 study (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2008</LINK>) had one- and two-year survival rates of 70.9% (95% CI 61.8 to 78.3) and 27.9% (95% CI 20.0 to 36.2). The value of surgery and/or local ablative therapies in people with good performance status, limited metastatic disease, and respond to chemotherapy is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Kataoka-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kataoka 2017</LINK>). A randomised clinical study (FLOT-5, NCT02578368) addressing the question if surgery further improves survival and quality of life in people with limited metastatic disease after pretreatment with FLOT is currently ongoing.</P>
<P>The question if strategies to reduce treatment burden, such as maintenance therapy, may be integrated in the continuum of care without compromising efficacy needs to be evaluated in further studies (<LINK REF="REF-Digklia-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Digklia 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to preliminary data from the neoadjuvant setting, people with well differentiated tumours have a greater chance to benefit from chemotherapy than others (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Batran-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Batran 2016</LINK>). Furthermore, not only targeted therapies, but also chemotherapies might not have the same efficacy in different molecular subtypes of gastric caner (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Syn-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syn 2016</LINK>)</P>
<P>Further integration of targeted therapies and development of new treatment approaches, such as immunotherapy, for which promising preliminary results have just been presented (<LINK REF="REF-Kang-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muro-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muro 2016</LINK>) is highly warranted. Furthermore, treatment strategies combining different immunotherapeutic agents, or chemotherapy and immunotherapy, or immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapies need further development. Valid biomarkers, which permit the selection of people with a high chance to respond to the different types of treatments are urgently required.</P>
<P>The role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, in which cytotoxic agents are infused into the peritoneum, particularly for people with advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination are being actively investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2017</LINK>). Randomised studies, including phase III studies, are currently ongoing, and in a future update to this review, it may be worth adding a comparison or subgroup to evaluate the benefits of this mode of chemotherapy administration.</P>
<P>For Her-2 positive breast cancer, great progress has been made with the introduction of agents like pertuzumab and T-DM1 (<LINK REF="REF-Swain-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swain 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 2012</LINK>), which showed major benefits in recent phase III studies, and many other molecules targeting this pathway are in clinical development. While a benefit for T-DM1 as second-line treatment could not be demonstrated for HER-2 positive gastric cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Kang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 2016</LINK>), phase III-results for pertuzumab in gastric cancer are still pending.</P>
<P>For any new treatment, apart from the assessment of outcomes like overall- and progression-free survival, the balance between relief of tumour-associated symptoms and treatment-associated toxicity needs to be evaluated from the person's perspective to determine the palliative value of new therapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer.</P>
<P>Quality of life assessment deserves adequate methodology. Validated measurement instruments are available: a disease-specific module to supplement the EORTC core quality of life questionnaire has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Vickery-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickery 2001</LINK>), a FACT-questionnaire for people with stomach cancer has been developed concurrently in North America and Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Eremenco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eremenco 2004</LINK>), and a clinical meaningful benefit may be defined in advance (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2003</LINK>). Nevertheless, quality of life assessment remains challenging. Therefore, according to a recent statement from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2014</LINK>), the interest has shifted to person's self reported specific symptom burden.</P>
<P>An ECOG performance status of 0 to 1 versus 2, and the presence of liver metastases and peritoneal metastases have been identified as poor prognostic factors by multivariate analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Chau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chau 2004</LINK>). A prognostic index was constructed dividing people into a good (no risk factor), moderate (one or two risk factors), and poor (three or more risk factors) risk group. This model has been validated in a second data set from the REAL-2 study. This study did also confirm the major prognostic impact of obtaining a radiological response: One- and two-year survival rates for responders were 70.9% (95% CI 61.8 to 78.3) and 27.9% (95% CI 20.0 to 36.2). Future studies should explicitly address the value of novel therapeutic strategies in different clinical risk groups.</P>
<P>Importantly, not all questions can be answered in randomised clinical studies. Further research on the risks and benefits of chemotherapy in both the elderly people population, as well as people who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for clinical studies is required. Therefore, large observational cohort studies or registries of people treated with standard treatment outside clinical studies are important, such as the analysis published by <LINK REF="REF-Dixon-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 2016</LINK>. Of note, both EORTC and ASCO (<LINK REF="REF-Pallis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wildiers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wildiers 2013</LINK>) have published recommendations for designing and reporting clinical studies in Geriatric Oncology in the future, which include obligatory reporting of age-related subgroup analysis, obligatory post-marketing studies in vulnerable and frail older people, and obligatory inclusion of a minimum dataset for senior adults in registration studies and post-marketing studies.</P>
<P>In view of the fact that second-line therapy has become a standard of care in the treatment of this disease, endpoints for clinical studies need reconsideration. Thus, in a disease where the sequential use of different treatments is established, overall survival might not be sufficiently sensitive as an endpoint for clinical studies. However, the correlation of progression-free survival with overall survival in advanced/recurrent gastric cancer was not confirmed in a recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Paoletti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoletti 2013</LINK>).</P>

For this reason we were unable to plan in advance the best way to compare categories of all relevant categories of combination chemotherapies (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Cutsem-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Cutsem 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We clarified how we dealt with multiple study arms from one study.</P>
<P>In the first update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2010</LINK>, submitted in November 2009), we chose to add the following comparisons based on their clinical relevance and the availability of a sufficient number of relevant studies. Among these, comparisons 3 and 4 have been added in the discussion of the previously published version of this review as they were not specified in advance. Comparisons 5 to 8 have been specified in advance in the last update of the review.</P>
<P>In this second update of this review (submitted in March 2017), we added two additional comparisons (9 and 10) and we differentiated between additive and substitutive comparisons in comparisons 5 and 6.</P>
<P>Comparison number:</P>
<P>3. 5-FU/cisplatin/anthracycline combinations versus 5-FU/cisplatin (without anthracyclines)</P>
<P>4. 5-FU/cisplatin/anthracycline-combinations versus 5-FU/anthracycline combinations (without cisplatin)</P>
<P>5. Irinotecan versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens</P>
<P>6. Docetaxel versus non-docetaxel-containing regimens</P>
<P>7. Regimens including oral 5-FU prodrugs versus intravenous fluoropyrimidines</P>
<P>8. Oxaliplatin versus cisplatin-containing regimens</P>
<P>9. Taxane-platinum-fluoropyrimidin combinations versus taxane-platinum (without fluoropyrimidine)</P>
<P>10. S-1 versus 5-FU-containing regimens </P>
<P>The method for statistical analysis in case of significant heterogeneity (I² &gt; 20%) is a random-effects model. Although the original version of the protocol does not state this, these changes were requested after methodological review by the Cochrane UGPD group. This methodological change is responsible for differences in HRs between this and the previously published version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>As recent studies have increasingly reported progression-free survival instead of time to progression, we included the former as secondary endpoints in this update.</P>
<P>While there was no evidence for both - the use of second-line therapy and targeted therapies - at the time the protocol for this review was written, both second-line and these targeted agents (trastuzumab in first-line for HER-2 positive people and ramucirumab in second-line) have changed the management options for advanced gastric cancer significantly and are therefore included in the discussion of the treatment options although not analysed in detail by this review.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we no longer use the Jadad scale to assess methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Instead we independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool described in Chapter 8 of the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Study did not clearly specify minimum required sample size - "Sample size was calculated on the basis of an expected 15% difference between the two groups, with 80% power and a two-sided [alpha] value of 0.05"</P>
<P>Comments from statistician BCT:The paper is not clear about how the sample size is being estimated. In particular, we do not have information on the HR or the survival probability of the control group. I assume the 15% difference refers to absolute difference. I try to work out this difference from the KM curve of Fig 2. If we assume a 1 year estimate, then the survival probability is approx. 25% vs 40% (HR approx. 0.66). If we assume a 0.5 year estimate, then the survival probability is 75% vs 90% (HR approx. 0.37). This corresponds to a total sample size of about 300 and 200 respectively, assuming a two-sided test at 5% level and a power of 80%. If we estimate the HR from the median OS that is reported, the HR is approx. 0.8, and so we would expect an even larger sample size.</P>
