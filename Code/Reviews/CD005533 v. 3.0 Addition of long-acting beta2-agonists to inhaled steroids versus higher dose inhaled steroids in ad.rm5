Well done! However it does illustrate the clinical heterogeneity arising from patient age, and background dose of ICS (in particular).

I would favour reporting the relative risk reduction of salmetero to formoterol which must bo RRR 0.75? Also worth pointing out 22 salmeterol studies and 2 formoterol studies.... We are not sure if the type of LABA is the true cause of this finding or other differences between patients dose of ICS duration (as you point out).

Suggest that baseline SDs used instead.&lt;br&gt;==============================================&lt;br&gt;18 aug Version back from FD&lt;br&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;br&gt;I have made some alterations to change the sense of your new wording. In the Abstract&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Reviewers' conclusions&lt;br&gt;In adult asthmatics, there was no significant difference between the combination of LABA and ICS and a higher dose of ICS for the prevention of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Overall, the combination therapy led to greater improvement in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue &amp;#223;2 agonists, (although most of the results are from trials of up to 24 weeks duration).&amp;quot; This highlights the shortage of data from longer trials but we cannot say if the effect wears off or not from the data presented.&lt;br&gt;I am quite happy with your amendment to the main outcome results emphasising absolute and relative differences.&lt;br&gt;The meta regression is hypothesis generating only so I have taken it out of implications for practice and added &amp;quot;meta regression suggests&amp;quot; to results paragraph otherwise readers may think that the review can confidently conclude that dose of ICS and duration definitely make a difference and we cannot be sure of that on present evidence.&lt;br&gt;This will go forward for the module submission next week.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all your hard work on it.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;CJC feedback from Statistical Peer review re meta-regression&lt;br&gt;1. There is no evidence of heterogeneity between trials overall (as reported in the review)&lt;br&gt;2. There are 8 variables and only 13 trials in the meta-regression&lt;br&gt;3. None of the variables is significant in bivariate analysis&lt;br&gt;4. This means that great caution is needed in reporting the results of meta-regression.&lt;br&gt;He suggested that the meta-regression could be taken out or at least toned down, and I have done the latter in the results and the discussion. At best this is hypothesis generating and it may not turn out to be correct so we need to be very careful not to mislead readers.&lt;br&gt;Toby, please check that authors are happy for this version to be submitted.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;=======================================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC final edit Jun 23 (changes in red).&lt;br&gt;We will leave the Hueck cross-over as it stands as there are no patients with exacerbation in one arm on reflection this is acceptable.&lt;br&gt;I have modified the synopsis to reflect the results across different outcomes, and made minor alterations to wording in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;The reports p values from single subgroups have been removed as suggested below.&lt;br&gt;Results: &amp;quot; By far, the most important factor was trial duration where extending the use of LABA for &amp;gt;24 weeks was associated with an increase in the overall RR of exacerbation (0.88) by a factor of 2.35 (95% CI of 1.20 to 4.61) to a RR of 2.07. In other words, use of LABA beyond 24 weeks no longer favoured the use of LABA in combination with ICS over higher ICS dose to prevent exacerbations. The protective effect of LABA on exacerbations also decreased with increasing ICS dose used in combination with LABA; that is, it increased the relative risk of exacerbation associated with the addition of LABA rather than use of a higher ICS dose, by a factor of 1.28 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.62) for every 100 mcg increase in ICS dose. This suggests that increasing the baseline dose of ICS from an average of about 400 to 500 mcg/day would increase the overall RR of exacerbations from 0.88 to 1.12.&amp;quot; I am not competent to say if this is correct and will ask for statistical peer review.&lt;br&gt;Discussion: Metaregression results are hypothesis generating and therefore toned down the discussion on this. Single subgroup results removed.&lt;br&gt;Sent out for Peer review comment today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=====================================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC edit Jun2 (see ----comments in text below)&lt;br&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;br&gt;I fear you will not like my responses below in relation to the subgroups and metaregression. I think we have two choices. The first is to remove any reference to p value testing of subgroups against the null ( BMJ 2003;326:219 ( 25 January )Education and debate. Statistics Notes. Interaction revisited: the difference between two estimates&lt;br&gt;Douglas G Altman, professor of statistics in medicine J Martin Bland, professor of medical statistics). I am 99% certain that a statistical peer reviewer would demand this. The second way would be to test out my theory by send this for peer review as it is to a statistician. I have done this with the other review in relation to the meta-regresion and await a response.&lt;br&gt;Have a think about it and let me know.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;======================&lt;br&gt;Edit CJC 5 may 05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution - very comprehensive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Liz will need to check these and the search strategy please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Very thorough. What is the ***0??? at the end of notes section for Fowler. Were you going to add any details under the table of ongoing studies?&lt;br&gt;DELETED---thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine but title of comparison 2#1 subgroup 2 needs correcting please.&lt;br&gt;DONE---thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Peto OR has to be used for making the subgroup comparison based on Chi-square do you want to change the default statistic to Peto for the Comparison 2 outcomes?&lt;br&gt;NOT DONE SINCE DATA PRESENTED AS RR ARE REPORTED IN THE RESULTS SECTION. IF SWITCHED TO PETO OR, THE DIFFERENT VALUES WILL CONFUSE READERS --- fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Currently missing. Could you write a one line summary and short user-friendly summary for consumers?&lt;br&gt;ADDED --- thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: &amp;quot;Subgroup analyses and meta-regression suggested two main factors favoring the combination of LABA and ICS over a higher dose of ICS, namely a dose of ICS &amp;lt;=400 mcg/day and treatment duration &amp;lt;=24 weeks.&amp;quot; I have removed this from the results in the abstract. See results below. Significant has been added in red in two places.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Two factors modulated the relative benefit of either treatment in favour of LABA, namely a low ICS dose to which LABA was added and short trial duration.&amp;quot; This really belongs in the discussion rather than reviewers' conclusions. They are limitations in the review.&lt;br&gt;OK SINCE SUBGROUP ANALYSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fine except no mention is made of how the cross-over trial data is handled. Did you use first arm data? If not I would recommend removing this study from the analyses, and since it is only a 6 week study carry-over would be a major concern! You would have to change all the studies to GIV to combine cross-over and parallel studies and this is not justified!&lt;br&gt;AGREED BUT THIS IS ONLY ONE TRIAL WITH SMALL N (27) CONTRIBUTING TO VERY FEW OUTCOMES WITH MINIMAL WEIGHT. DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF STAYS IN. DATA IIN AGREEMENT WITH OTHER TRIALS .&lt;br&gt;NOT REMOVED --- I do not agree with this. The method used in RevMan is WRONG when using cross-overs as if they were parallel. Compromise would be to keep it in the forest plots and make the SD zero so it does not alter the pooled results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;quot;However, there was a protective effect of the combination of ICS and LABA when the ICS dose in the LABA group was &amp;lt;=400 mcg/day [N=12, RR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.00)] as compared to an ICS dose of &amp;gt;= 500 mcg/day [N=3, RR=1.21 95% CI 0.69, 2.12), but the group difference did not reach statistical significance (chi2=0.99, 1df, p&amp;gt;0.10). Similarly, a protective effect of LABA was apparent in trials lasting 24 weeks or less (N= 11, RR=0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) in contrast to longer trials of 52 to 54 weeks (N= 4, RR=0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.21) while the group difference did not reached statistical significance (chi2=1.67, 1df, P&amp;gt;0.10). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I feel that the above paragraph is misleading as there is NO significant difference between the subgroups and this is misleading as stated. I have inserted a new sentence in red.&lt;br&gt;TAKE NOTE THAT THESE TWO SUBGROUPS REACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ICS DOSE WITH LABA &amp;lt;=400 AND SHORT TRIALS. SALMETEROL AS WELL. I AM DESAPPOINTED YOU REMOVED THIS, CONSIDERING THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MENTIONING THAT THE SALMETEROL GROUP ALONE WAS SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT THAT THESE 2 FACTORS.&lt;br&gt;WE MUST BE CONSISTENT IN THE MEANS OF REPORTING.. ---- I agree we must be consistent, and the correct way to report this is to IGNORE the p values of the individual subgroups and ONLY report whether there are between subgroup differences in all 3 cases (see Altman paper in the BMJ). A statistical peer reviewer would have a fit if they saw this in the present state. Great care is needed when the reporting of the data could be skewed by the interest of the message. I think we have to go back to the drawing board with this - if you do not agree I will send this for statistical peer review in the current format and see what response we get!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEE MODIFICATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a huge fan of meta-regression, and I have to say that the findings in relation to the increase in RR for 100mcg increase in ICS are not believable. The confidence interval is wide and includes no difference (just). Moreover this would imply that a 300mcg increase would mean that LABA addition was positively harmful and there is NO EVIDENCE from the review to support this. I would advise that you report this as of borderline significance and do not take it further than that. Interpretationi of meta-regression that is not supported by a significant subgroup difference (as above) is fraught with difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS NOT THE LABA ADDITION BUT THE DOSE OF ICS USED IN COMBINATION WITH LABA. LOOK AT OUTCOMES 2.1 ( and 2.6), IN FACT THE RESULTS OF THE META-REGRESSION ARE CONCORDANT IWTH THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OBSERVED IN THE SPECIFIED SUBGROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE SUBGROUP ANALYSES WERE NS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The protective effect of combination of LABA and ICS over higher ICS was greatest in patients with normal FEV1 on baseline after adjusting for ICS dose and trial duration. The RR of exacerbations was increased by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI 0.95 to 3.26) in patients with moderate airway obstruction (FEV1 &amp;lt;=79% of predicted), favoring a higher dose of ICS over the combination of LABA and ICS in the sickest patients. Finally, the dose difference in ICS between groups appears to inversely correlate with the protective effect of LABA, where a 100 mcg group difference in ICS dose increased the protective effect of LABA by a factor of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.01).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have removed this paragraph because neither of the changes reported is statistically significant and therefore should not be reported as significant findings.&lt;br&gt;OK --- thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;Have you considered that the Shrewsbury results might be different merely because Salmeterol was considered. There is no significant sub-group difference between Salmeterol and Formoterol BUT the Salmeterol group alone is significant. This is perhaps worth mentioning (but including both of the above statements)?&lt;br&gt;FUNNY, I MADE THE SAME COMMENT TO YOU REGARDING SALMETEROL !&lt;br&gt;CLEARLY WE NEED TO BE HARMONIOUS IN THE WAY TO DESCRIBE THESE RESULTS WITHOUT CONFUSING THE READER. SEE RED.&lt;br&gt;THE MAIN REASON THIS REVIEW IS DIFFERENT FROM AUTHORS IS THE SELECTION OF MAIN OUTCOME (EXACERBATIONS RATHER THAN PFT). ALL REVIEWS ARE CONCORDANT WHEN CONSIDERING PFTS. --- I agree with your conclusion on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have highlighted two paragraphs in red. What do mean by RR 2.06 for the trials of longer duration. Are you suggesting that in these trials LABA addition increases the likelihood of exacerbation. Surely not?&lt;br&gt;NO THAT THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF THE ADDITION OF LABA TO ICS IS LOST&lt;br&gt;CORRECTED --- this too will need statistical input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may reduce the benefit but why should it turn benefit to harm? Is this a problem of using RR for metaregression instead of OR? I still feel the metaregression is being overplayed. If you send me the metaregression graphs I will see if I can find a statistician to look at this a bit more.&lt;br&gt;Also you cannot use non-significant sub-group trends to support your metaregression findings. NO, I'M USING THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF LABA FOR THESE SPECIFIC GROUPS --- this is not allowed (see Altman paper again)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you assert that choice of LABA makes no difference when the same subgroup situation arises as with duration. Significant in one group and not in the other with a non-significant Chi2 test.? You cannot have it both ways!!&lt;br&gt;YES, WE BOTH HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.&lt;br&gt;SEE REVISED SENTENCES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Confounding might occur when a different ICS is used in the two arms, but since the clinically important question is not altered by which ICS is used in each arm I am happy to include Symbicort v Fluticasone, for example. Check that Peto OR is method used for subgroup comparisons.&lt;br&gt;WE ADJUSTED FOR THIS ISSUE , BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BIOLOGICAL STRENGHT OF EACH PREPARATION IN THE CALCULATION OF ICS DOSE. --- ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REviewers' conclusions&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;while a higher dose of ICS appears superior for longer treatment &amp;quot; I have to say that I can find no support at all for this statement from the data in the review! There are no outcomes for which higher ICS appear superior in my view.&lt;br&gt;RIGHT - REWORDED --- thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked - done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - back to authors for response please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-03-16 22:56:48 -0400" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="HIGH-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.23" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="3.0">

<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:16:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">The addition of long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled steroids compared to higher doses of inhaled steroids alone as maintenance treatment for chronic asthma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:16:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>When asthma is inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids, either adding medication such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) or increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids is recommended. The purpose of this review was to establish the benefits and safety of adding long-acting beta2-agonists or increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma that is inadequately controlled on their current dose of inhaled corticosteroids. This review analysed data from identified randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids versus increasing to a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children and adults.</P>
<P>Based on the identified trials:</P>
<P>1. There is a modest advantage in adding long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids, compared with increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids, in preventing exacerbations but many patients (more than 70) need to be treated for one to have an exacerbation prevented. The results apply particularly to adults, as no group differences were observed in children. Reduction in symptoms and use of rescue beta2-agonists as well as improvement in lung function tests also slightly favour the combination of long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids over a higher corticosteroid dose.</P>
<P>2. Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral thrush, there is no apparent difference in the risk of side effects or rates of withdrawal from treatment because of side effects between the treatment options, but the long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids were seldom monitored. However, the trends towards an increased risk of moderate and severe exacerbations in children receiving combination therapy raises concern about this therapy, particularly in view of the modest improvement shown.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-16 22:56:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 48 studies (15,155 participants including 1155 children and 14,000 adults). Participants were inadequately controlled on their current ICS regimen, experiencing ongoing symptoms and with generally moderate (FEV1 60% to 79% of predicted) airway obstruction. The studies tested the combination of salmeterol or formoterol with a median dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent (BDP-eq) compared to a median of 1000 mcg/day of BDP-eq, usually for 24 weeks or less. There was a statistically significantly lower risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in patients treated with LABA and ICS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98, 27 studies, N = 10,578) from 11.45% to 10%, with a number needed to treat of 73 (median study duration: 12 weeks). The study results were dominated by adult studies; trial data from three paediatric studies showed a trend towards increased risk of rescue oral steroids (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.66) and hospital admission (RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 6.64) associated with combination therapy. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk ratios for either hospital admission (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56) or serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37). The combination of LABA and ICS resulted in significantly greater but modest improvement from baseline in lung function, symptoms and rescue medication use than with higher ICS dose. Despite no significant group difference in the risk of overall adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03), there was an increase in the risk of tremor (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.82) and a lower risk of oral thrush (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86)) in the LABA and ICS compared to the higher ICS group. There was no significant difference in hoarseness or headache between the treatment groups. The rate of withdrawals due to poor asthma control favoured the combination of LABA and ICS (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.83).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-16 22:32:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ICS monotherapy, the combination of LABA and ICS is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS. Combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy, the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored. In children, combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk, of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. These trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:17:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Beta-2 adrenergic agonists are the major class of medication used for the relief of asthma symptoms. They produce their effects through interaction with specific ß<SUB>2</SUB> adrenergic receptors located in the plasma membrane of virtually all types of cells, including bronchial wall smooth muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). For several decades, short-acting inhaled ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists have been the primary agents used to treat patients with asthma. Their benefits include rapid onset of bronchodilation within five to 15 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>), highly effective protection against exercise-induced asthma and protection against the early asthmatic response to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1998</LINK>). Their duration of action is only three to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). Short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists do not seem to have any effect on overall severity of asthma, nor on inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1998</LINK>). Long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists, such as salmeterol and formoterol, have been developed for more prolonged control of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>). Slightly slower in onset of action than short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists, inhaled salmeterol exerts its bronchodilating effect within ten to 20 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Adkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adkins 1997</LINK>). This effect then lasts up to 12 hours due to high affinity binding of the molecule's side chain to a specific site within the ß<SUB>2</SUB> adrenergic receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Adkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). Formoterol, on the other hand, has an onset of bronchodilation within less than five minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Bartow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartow 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>) and a duration of action similar to that of salmeterol. Due to its ability to enter the cell's lipid bilayer, it becomes available over a prolonged period to stimulate the receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). These two long-acting ß<SUB>2 </SUB>agonists have been shown to reduce daytime and nighttime symptoms, improve quality of sleep, reduce requirement for short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sears-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1998</LINK>) and protect against methacholine-induced, cold air-induced and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). Long-acting inhaled ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists are currently used in the maintenance, rather than in the acute treatment, of children aged six years and older and adults with asthma. At time of publication, these drugs have not yet been marketed for children less than four years old, although such approval may currently be sought in several countries.</P>
<P>The need for frequent use of ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists generally indicates a significant inflammatory process that should be controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Fireman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fireman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1998</LINK>). Inhaled corticosteroids are currently the most effective anti-inflammatory drugs used for long-term control of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manning-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>When asthma control is unsatisfactory despite low doses of inhaled corticosteroids, several options have been proposed: increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids or adding other agents such as long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists or theophylline. Of all add-on therapies, long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists have emerged as the preferred option in terms of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008-_x0028_updated-June-09_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008 (updated June 09)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-Publication-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Publication 2007</LINK>). Guidelines differ with regards to choosing between increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids or adding long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists for adults, children, toddlers and infants/toddlers.</P>
<P>In <U>adults</U>, all but the British guidelines prefer the addition of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists to inhaled corticosteroids in cases of sub-optimal control on inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy. The Canadian and Australian Consensus statement recommends the addition of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists if control is unsatisfactory with 400 mcg/day of CFC-beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent (<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>, ) while doses of 200 to 800 mcg/day are recommended by the British guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008-_x0028_updated-June-09_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008 (updated June 09)</LINK>). In contrast, the American guidelines give equal weight to adding long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists or increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Publication-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Publication 2007</LINK>). In <U>children aged 5 years and older</U> with poor control on 400 mcg/day of BDP-equivalent, it is recommended to first increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids to a medium dose in the Australian (<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2006</LINK>), Canadian (<LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>) and International (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>) statements, before adding long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists, where the paediatric medium dose is 401 to 800 mcg/day for all but the Gina guidelines where it is 201 to 400 mcg/day. The American guidelines give equal weight to increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dose of a moderate dose or adding a long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist. In contrast, the British (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008-_x0028_updated-June-09_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008 (updated June 09)</LINK>) guidelines recommend the addition of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists at an inhaled corticosteroid dose of 400 mcg/day before increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dose to 800 mcg/day. In <U>infants and preschool-aged children</U>, the American guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Publication-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Publication 2007</LINK>) recommend increasing the dose of ICS to a medium dose as the preferred option. The British Thoracic Society guidelines do not recommend the use of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008-_x0028_updated-June-09_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008 (updated June 09)</LINK>, while other guidelines have made no specific statement. Clearly, uncertainties persist regarding the severity of airway obstruction and the baseline dose of inhaled corticosteroids to which addition of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists may be preferable to increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. The influence of age for optimising treatment strategies is also unclear.</P>
<P>Two published meta-analyses initially examined the combination of salmeterol with inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Shrewsbury-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrewsbury 2000</LINK>) or with fluticasone specifically (<LINK REF="STD-Heyneman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heyneman 2002</LINK>) as compared to a double-dose inhaled corticosteroid. Both of these reviews demonstrated clear superiority of combination therapy with regards to lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists. <LINK REF="REF-Shrewsbury-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrewsbury 2000</LINK> also showed that combination therapy was superior in the prevention of asthma exacerbations. However, these meta-analyses were not systematic reviews in that they:</P>
<OL>
<LI>only included trials sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline;</LI>
<LI>tested only salmeterol as the long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist; and</LI>
<LI>were limited to adult trials.</LI>
</OL>
<P>However, the safety of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids has been challenged. There have been clear indications that the use of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists as monotherapy is worse than use in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Warner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1998</LINK>). A recent systematic review combining trials in which long-acting ß<SUB>2 </SUB>agonists were used alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids reported an increase in the risk of serious adverse events associated with long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>). The possible protection offered by inhaled corticosteroids has led to recommendations from national and international asthma consensus statements that stipulate the use of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists only in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2008-_x0028_updated-June-09_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2008 (updated June 09)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Georgitis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgitis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-Publication-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Publication 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1998</LINK>). Yet concerns about the safety of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists must clearly be addressed in adults and particularly in children, in whom few data are available.</P>
<P>We published a Cochrane Review comparing the combination of any long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist preparation and inhaled corticosteroids to increased inhaled corticosteroid dose and documented the beneficial effect of combination therapy on asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, lung function, symptoms and rescue bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). With the publication of several additional trials since 2005, we believed a systematic review comparing the combination of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist and inhaled corticosteroids to a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids would provide a more unbiased view of the evidence on safety and efficacy and, perhaps, greater insight as to the patient and treatment characteristics associated with greater benefit or harm from either treatment option. We believed this update would strengthen the evidence supporting the safety of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists when used in combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:17:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the relative benefit and safety profile of the combination of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients with or without previous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. We also wished to examine whether the benefit of either treatment option was influenced by the severity of airway obstruction, age, baseline dose of inhaled corticosteroids to which LABA was added, ICS dose difference between treatment options, use of one or two devices to deliver combination therapy, dose and type of long-acting ß<SUB>2 </SUB>agonist and duration of intervention.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:17:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The analysis focused on the following comparison:</P>
<P>Long-acting ß2 agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) versus a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids as second-line treatment (i.e. in patients who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline).</P>
<P>Note that given the large size of this review, other comparisons originally stated in the protocol published in 1999 were assessed in two other reviews. This includes comparing the addition of LABA to similar (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2009a</LINK>) and tapering doses of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Participants had inadequate control of their asthma at the time of enrolment in all but three studies (<LINK REF="STD-LOCCS" TYPE="STUDY">LOCCS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermetten-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermetten 1999</LINK>). Severity of airway obstruction was generally moderate, with a baseline FEV1 or PEF 60% to 80% of predicted in 23 studies. Twelve studies recruited patients with minimal airway obstruction, with a mean baseline FEV1 or PEF of 80% of predicted or more (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kips-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kips 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lalloo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lalloo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LOCCS" TYPE="STUDY">LOCCS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAM104926" TYPE="STUDY">SAM104926</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAM40012" TYPE="STUDY">SAM40012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SFCF4026" TYPE="STUDY">SFCF4026</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verberne-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verberne 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermetten-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermetten 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2003</LINK>).

In the majority of manufacturer's study reports available from the GlaxoSmithKline website, baseline FEV1 predicted was not available.</P>
<P>All but four studies required the intake of inhaled corticosteroids for a minimum of one to three months prior to randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Condemi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Condemi 1999</LINK> included a proportion of patients who were corticosteroid-naive prior to enrolment, but who remained symptomatic despite inhaled corticosteroids during the two to four-week run-in phase.

<P>The presence of atopic disease at baseline was reported in four studies.

<P>The long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist preparation was salmeterol xinafoate in 35 studies and formoterol in the remaining 13. All but three tested the standard dose of the long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist (salmeterol 50 mcg bid and formoterol 12 mcg bid). One study tested a double dose of salmeterol, i.e. 100 mcg bid (<LINK REF="STD-Woolcock-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Woolcock 1996a</LINK>), one study assessed a double dose of formoterol (<LINK REF="STD-SD-039-0728" TYPE="STUDY">SD 039 0728</LINK>) and two studies tested a 6 mcg bid dose of formoterol (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lalloo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lalloo 2003</LINK>).</P>

The remaining studies tested the delivery of LABA and ICS by separate devices. Adherence to study medication was monitored during the run-in and/or the treatment period in 13 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baraniuk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baraniuk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greening-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heuck-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heuck 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kelsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kips-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kips 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lalloo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lalloo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1999</LINK>), but adherence observed during the trial was seldom reported, nor used for efficacy or subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>The type of inhaled corticosteroid varied among the studies. Forty-three studies compared the same inhaled corticosteroid preparation in both the LABA and the control groups. Ten studies compared CFC-beclomethasone, 11 trials assessed budesonide and 22 assessed fluticasone.</P>
<P>Five studies compared the combination of fluticasone propionate and long acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist to CFC-beclomethasone (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAM30022" TYPE="STUDY">SAM30022</LINK>), budesonide (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2005</LINK>) or HFA-BDP (<LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2002</LINK>) in the higher ICS group. One study compared the combination of LABA and the patients' own pre-study corticosteroid to additional fluticasone in the higher ICS group (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>). Finally, one study compared budesonide and long acting ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist to fluticasone propionate in the higher ICS group (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>After conversion of all doses of inhaled corticosteroids in CFC-equivalent (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Publication-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Publication 2007</LINK>), the median dose (25th, 75th) of inhaled corticosteroids in the LABA group was 400 (400, 800) with a range of 200 to 1000 mcg/day, while the median dose in the higher ICS group was 1000 (800, 1000) with a range of 400 to 2000. The median absolute dose difference between the intervention and the control group was 600 (400, 600) mcg/day with a range of 200 to 1200. When stated as median relative ICS dose difference, the control group tested a quite homogenous 2.5-fold (2, 2.5) increase in ICS dose as compared to the LABA group. Of note, in absence of adequate details provided by the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-Noord-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Noord 1999</LINK>, we assumed that an equal proportion of patients of the intervention group received 100 and 250 mcg/day of fluticasone, respectively, for an average daily intake of 700 mcg/day of beclomethasone-equivalent in the LABA + ICS group and double in the higher ICS group.</P>
<P>Co-interventions with other prophylactic medications, such as xanthines, sodium cromoglycate and anticholinergics, was permitted in nine studies provided that doses remained unchanged throughout the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baraniuk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baraniuk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greening-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ind-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ind 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Noord-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Noord 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woolcock-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Woolcock 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woolcock-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Woolcock 1996b</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: oral steroid-treated exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Beta-2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) + inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment led to a lower risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations than higher doses of ICS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98, P = 0.02; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, N = 25 studies, 9833 participants). There was no evidence of publication bias as the Egger's test for bias was -0.23(95% CI -1.95 to 1.48). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP> 2</SUP> = 2%).</P>
<P>The risk difference was -0.01 (-0.02 to -0.00). Based on the total number of participants with oral steroid-treated exacerbations, the effect of LABA was to reduce the risk of exacerbations from 11.45% in the higher ICS group to 10% in the combination groups. This is compatible with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 73(95% CI 42 to 437) from studies with a median duration of 12 weeks. However, due to variation in the rate of rescue oral corticosteroids in the control groups, we also calculated NNTs for four different control group risks based on control group risk quartiles (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>):</P>

<P>Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not suggest any significant asymmetry in the analyses we assembled (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The fail-safe N test estimated that 154 studies would be needed to reverse the observed group difference.</P>

<P>Among studies contributing data to the main outcome, the median dose (interquartile range) of inhaled corticosteroids in the LABA group was quite homogeneous at 400 (400 to 400) with a range of 200 to 1000 mcg/day, while the median dose in the higher ICS group was 1000 (800 to 1000). The median absolute dose difference between the intervention and the control group was 600 (400 to 600) mcg/day. The median FEV1 was 77 (71 to 85)% of predicted and the median treatment duration was 12 (12 to 24) weeks. All studies were funded by the manufacturer.</P>
<P>We had planned <I>a priori </I>analyses<I> </I>to explore the influence of the a number of variables on the magnitude of effect (effect modification or confounding). From the subgroup analyses both LABA type and study duration gave statistically significant results. Studies testing salmeterol show a significantly greater group difference in favour of combination therapy than those testing formoterol (RR 0.75 versus 1.00). The ratio of these risk ratios (RRR) was 1.33, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.67 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Studies of six months duration or less were also significantly more likely to be associated with a reduced risk of rescue oral steroids (i.e. a larger effect size) than longer duration trials (RR 0.72 versus 1.00; RRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.78, <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Both variables were highly correlated (r = -0.70), and the correlation made it impossible to disentangle the relative contribution of either LABA type or duration of study to the size of effect. It is noteworthy that the dose of LABA, dose of ICS dose combined with LABA, ICS dose difference between the two groups, number of devices to deliver combination therapy, and publication status were not important effect modifiers. The majority of studies recruited adults: the subgroup estimate for these studies favoured the use of LABA in reducing the risk of oral steroid treatment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97). In children the result was not statistically significant (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.66, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Although the test for interaction between these subgroup analyses gave a non-statistically significant result (P = 0.29), the RRR included the possibility that children could be almost three times more likely than adults to require oral-steroids when treated with a LABA than they were when treated with increased steroids (RRR 1.42, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.77).</P>
<P>The meta-regression provided additional information. Since one study included a group with zero events (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>), we entered 0.1 for missing data to allow the meta-regression to be performed on all 27 studies contributing to the main outcome: sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK> did not affect the results. The multivariate regression suggested that higher baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, children and formoterol were associated with increased risk of poor response to combination therapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-16 22:45:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review demonstrates that the addition of long-acting inhaled ß2 agonists (LABA) to moderate doses of inhaled steroids (ICS) reduces the relative risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations by around 12% and the absolute risk by about 1%. The evidence that forms the basis of this result is predominantly from adults. In children the evidence for the use of LABAs over increased doses of inhaled steroids is less favourable towards LABA, and includes the possibility that increased steroids is superior in reducing the requirement for oral steroids and hospital admissions. Overall 73 patients need to be treated with combination therapy to prevent one use of rescue oral corticosteroids. Based on number needed to treat (NNT) calculations for the different control group risks in the studies included in our analyses, this would mean that 45 patients in the high-risk trials (where study duration was between six and 12 months and study populations had significant airway obstruction), and 673 patients in the low-risk trials (where study duration was between three and six months and study populations had less severe airway obstruction) would need to be treated with a LABA instead of increased dose of ICS in order to prevent one experiencing an exacerbation requiring oral steroids. Although neither the dose of ICS to which LABA was added nor the difference in ICS dose between groups influenced the effect size. These findings predominantly apply to patients who remained symptomatic at baseline despite a median ICS dose of 400 mcg/day.</P>
<P>Neither the dose of ICS to which LABA was added nor the number of devices to administer combination therapy appear to affect the magnitude of protection conferred by LABA, as supported by the subgroup analyses and meta-regression. While no definitive conclusions can be derived from the subgroup analyses and the meta-regression,<B> </B>the findings highlight several factors that appear to influence the magnitude of response to combination therapy compared to higher doses of ICS. These factors, difficult to disentangle due to their correlation, are the LABA used, the duration of treatment, the mean FEV1 and the age group: formoterol, longer duration of treatment, higher mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at baseline, and children (versus adults) appear to decrease the efficacy of combination therapy. These apparent effect modifiers should be explored in future studies with a long-term duration (of one year and beyond), to provide confirmatory evidence of the findings our primary analysis.</P>
<P>There is a theoretical possibility that in the long-run higher doses of ICS may be superior to lower doses of ICS in combination with LABA for preventing exacerbations. One cannot rule out the possibility that the addition of LABA to corticosteroids allows the progression or the ongoing presence of airway inflammation, a factor that could become more evident with prolonged exposure to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Reddel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddel 2000</LINK>). Despite several trials investigating inflammation, most inflammatory markers could not be aggregated due to the various markers measured in different media (serum (<LINK REF="STD-Heuck-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heuck 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2002</LINK>), sputum (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kips-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kips 2000</LINK>), bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2003</LINK>), urine (<LINK REF="STD-Heuck-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heuck 2000</LINK>) and expired air (<LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2002</LINK>)). This prevented us from examining the impact of either treatment option on most inflammatory markers. Serum ECP (measured in two trials) revealed no group difference after four to six weeks of treatment with 200 to 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone-equivalent combined with LABA. Moreover, the absence of characterisation of the type and amount of airway inflammation, measured for example by sputum analysis, prevented the identification of the best therapy (and the amount of inhaled corticosteroids) needed for individual patients.</P>
<P>Could the beneficial effect of combination therapy be explained by an initial better compliance with combination therapy that tapers down with time to that observed with inhaled corticosteroids alone? Surprisingly, although 13 trials monitored it during the treatment period, compliance was seldom reported, nor were analyses stratified based on compliance. In the absence of these data this hypothesis cannot be tested. Conversely, LABA may have a more rapid effect on lung function and symptoms than ICS and be more effective when needed, that is, when baseline FEV1 is lower. Moreover, the dose of ICS and duration of treatment may differentially affect different manifestations of asthma. Indeed, rapid improvement in lung function and symptoms have been documented with a higher ICS dose (<LINK REF="STD-Currie-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Currie 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reddel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddel 2000</LINK>), while the beneficial effect of low doses of ICS on airway hyperreactivity, severe exacerbations and death requires prolonged (more than one year) treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>With only limited data for our primary outcome available from the seven small paediatric trials and two which recruited adults and children (accounting for 2% of the weight in the results) together with the unreported proportion of adolescents in recruited to the adult studies, there are insufficient data to comment firmly on a differential effect associated with age. However, the trends toward an increased risk of rescue oral corticosteroids and hospital admissions in children on combination therapy merits caution. Careful risk-benefit assessment should be done before using combination therapy instead of higher dose ICS in children aged 12 years or less with due consideration of the uncertain impact on the severity of exacerbations, against the known risk of growth retardation associated with steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>). One study measured linear growth in children in this review, and reported a significantly lower growth rate over one year in the higher dose steroid group compared with combination therapy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.60" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.60</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes were uniformly supportive of the beneficial effect of LABA, although the magnitude of benefit on lung function, symptoms and rescue ß<SUB>2 </SUB>agonists use appears modest. It is of note that two of the 52-week trials graphically displayed the change in lung function over time and identified an initial improvement favouring combination therapy over higher ICS in the first 24 weeks, with gradually overlapping values thereafter (<LINK REF="STD-Kips-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kips 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verberne-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verberne 1998</LINK>). These downward trends after 24 weeks were less pronounced in the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997</LINK>). Yet the sustained improvement in FEV1 observed over time makes tachyphylaxis a difficult explanation for the apparent waning protection against exacerbations, particularly since it has been described as occurring within a few weeks of treatment. Morning and evening PEF, whether reported as change or value at endpoint, also favour the use of LABA. The 12% increase in symptom-free days favoured the addition of LABA to ICS. Surprisingly, the use of LABA only reduced the use of rescue ß<SUB>2 </SUB>agonists by less than half a puff per day, with a non-significant group difference in nighttime use of rescue medication. No <I>post hoc</I> subgroup analyses on trial duration or dose of ICS were done on secondary outcomes to avoid multiple comparisons. The representation of long-term studies in most secondary outcomes was minimal. In this review the addition of LABA appears somewhat superior to increased ICS in controlling day-to-day symptoms and improving lung function.</P>
<P>With the exception of tremor, the addition of LABA was not associated with any difference compared with higher doses of ICS in overall or specific adverse effects. Removing the study using a higher than licensed dose of LABA yielded a non-statistically significant result between the treatments in tremor. As might be expected, oral candidiasis was more frequent in patients treated with a higher dose of ICS than in those treated with combination therapy. The safety of LABAs remains a question of some controversy since the uncertainty around the pooled effect from combination studies has not ruled important differences in the likelihood of serious adverse events from clinical trial data (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009b</LINK>). Similarly, our review does not provide conclusive proof of the safety of LABAs when compared with high-dose steroids alone, even though the pooled result includes unity. In the absence of systematic documentation of the adverse effects specific to inhaled corticosteroids (i.e. adrenal dysfunction, osteopenia and growth in children) or LABAs, the long-term safety of either strategy, particularly in children remains to be demonstrated. There is an urgent need to conduct studies addressing this question with systematic assessment of these potential adverse effects. In summary, while the data provide some reassurance, there is some uncertainty around the risk of severe adverse health events associated with the use of LABA even in presence of inhaled corticosteroids, and particularly so in children.</P>
<P>To whom can these results be generalised? Patients included in the eligible trials were largely adults, who were symptomatic on their current inhaled corticosteroids dose, demonstrated significant (&gt;= 12% or 15%) reversibility in FEV1 with ß<SUB>2</SUB> agonist and did not have severe airway obstruction or recent asthma exacerbations. The reversibility to bronchodilator tends to favour the LABA option over inhaled corticosteroids and may seriously limit generalisability since reversibility to bronchodilator is a criteria met in less than 10% of patients at a given point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Storms-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2003</LINK>). Since pregnant or lactating women as well as those of childbearing age without appropriate contraception were generally not eligible, a large proportion of females were probably excluded. Few studies reported the smoking status of their patients. This raises an important question regarding applicability of findings to smokers, a group that has been shown to display significant resistance to both oral (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhuri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhuri 2003</LINK>) and inhaled (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2002</LINK>) corticosteroids. Recognising the possibility of patient selection bias, the findings may be applied to adult asthmatics who remain symptomatic on 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent, with a mild or moderate airway obstruction reversible with bronchodilator. With the small weight carried by paediatric trials, generalising these results to children would be inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2009b</LINK>). No data are available for preschool-aged children.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, this systematic review is the largest meta-analysis comparing the relative benefit and harms of the combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids to a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. It provides complementary information to another Cochrane Review examining the relative benefit of adding LABA or a leukotriene receptor antagonist to inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2006</LINK>). The three options currently recommended by international consensus statements in the face of sub-optimal asthma control on inhaled corticosteroids have now been covered by Cochrane Reviews. The results of this review are strengthened by the overall high methodological quality of the included trials and confirmation of methodology and data by authors or sponsors of several trials, including the provision of unpublished data. The present review had sufficient power to explore variables associated with the effectiveness of either treatment option. In future research priority should be given to addressing the large gap in knowledge related to these two treatment options in children and adolescents.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-16 22:56:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In adult patients who remain symptomatic on 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent, two strategies may be considered: adding a long-acting ß2 agonist (LABA) or increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to 800 or 1000 mcg/day. There is a slight but significant difference favouring LABA in offering protection against the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. The reduction in the relative risk is 12% while the absolute reduction is about 1%, with an overall number needed to treat to prevent an exacerbation of 72, which varies from 45 from high-event studies(predominantly long-term ones) to 772 in low-event studies. Baseline FEV1, treatment duration and type of LABA may modify the magnitude of effect, although we can only speculate about their true relationship to the overall effect as the latter two are themselves highly correlated with each other. The combination of long-acting ß2 agonists with inhaled corticosteroids leads to greater but modest improvement in FEV1 (+ 80 mL), symptoms and rescue ß2 agonists (-0.5 puff/day) than a 2 to 2.5-fold higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids, although most of the data come from trials of six months or less. Studies conducted in school-aged children contributed few data to the primary outcome and we cannot comment firmly on the relative treatment effect in children and adolescents. Due to the apparent trend toward higher risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids and hospital admission, caution should be advised when considering use of combination therapy in children as higher ICS dose may be preferable. However, impaired growth in children treated with higher doses of inhaled steroids has been identified in one study, and this should be weighed against the uncertain (and possibly unfavourable) effects of combination therapy on oral steroid requirement in children. The lack of group difference in reported side effects should be interpreted with caution in the absence of systematic documentation of airway inflammation parameters, as well as adverse effects typically associated with long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (osteopenia, growth and adrenal suppression), particularly in children.</P>

<P>To address the current gaps in knowledge, future trials should focus on the paediatric and adolescent populations, in whom the gap in knowledge is particularly pressing, and investigate the impact of treatment duration of LABA of the effect size. Moreover, there is a need to characterise patients at baseline better (in terms of type and amount of airway inflammation, phenotype, genotype, smoking status, etc.) to examine the relative efficacy of each treatment strategy for individual patient characteristics.</P>

<P>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Studies to be included underwent quality assessment, performed independently by two reviewers (IRG or MNC and FMD), using two methods. First, using the Cochrane approach to assess allocation of concealment, trials were scored using the following principles:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Unclear concealment<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment</P>
<P>In addition, each study was assessed using a 0 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and summarised as follows:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised (1 = yes; 0 = no)?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind (1 = yes; 0 = no)?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts(1 = yes; 0 = no)?<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1 = yes; 0 = no)?<BR/>5. Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate (1 = yes; 0 = no)?<BR/>6. Deduct one point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-09 10:28:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies has been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (cross-over, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and is restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
