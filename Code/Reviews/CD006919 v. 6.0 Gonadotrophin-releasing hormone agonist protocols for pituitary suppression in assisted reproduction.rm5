<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol.</P>
<P>None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-31 06:28:55 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched the following databases from inception to April 2015: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and registries of ongoing trials. Reference lists of relevant articles were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-08-14 01:26:08 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any two protocols of GnRHa used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in subfertile women.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-19 00:30:01 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary outcome measure was number of live births or ongoing pregnancies per woman/couple randomised. Secondary outcome measures were number of clinical pregnancies, number of oocytes retrieved, dose of gonadotrophins used, adverse effects (pregnancy losses, ovarian hyperstimulation, cycle cancellation, and premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges), and cost and acceptability of the regimens. We combined data to calculate odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-04 22:19:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 37 RCTs (3872 women), one ongoing trial, and one trial awaiting classification. These trials made nine different comparisons between protocols. Twenty of the RCTs compared long protocols and short protocols. Only 19/37 RCTs reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy.</P>
<P>There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between a long protocol and a short protocol in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.81; 12 RCTs, n = 976 women, I = 15%, low quality evidence). Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. There was evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.92; 20 RCTs, n = 1643 women, I = 27%, moderate quality evidence) associated with the use of a long protocol.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates when the following GnRHa protocols were compared: long versus ultrashort protocol (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.36; one RCT, n = 150 women, low quality evidence), long luteal versus long follicular phase protocol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.10; one RCT, n = 223 women, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was stopped versus when it was continued (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33; three RCTs, n = 290 women, I = 0%, low quality evidence), when the dose of GnRHa was reduced versus when the same dose was continued (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52; four RCTs, n = 407 women, I = 0%, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was discontinued versus continued after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration in the long protocol (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.64; one RCT, n = 181 women, low quality evidence), and when administration of GnRHa lasted for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.68; one RCT, n = 85 women, low quality evidence). Our primary outcomes were not reported for any other comparisons.</P>
<P>Regarding adverse events, there were insufficient data to enable us to reach any conclusions except about the cycle cancellation rate. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in cycle cancellation rate (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.55; 11 RCTs, n = 1026 women, I = 42%, low quality evidence) when a long protocol was compared with a short protocol. This suggests that in a population in which 9% of women would have their cycles cancelled using a short protocol, between 5.5% and 14% will have cancelled cycles when using a long protocol.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-20 02:20:39 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-18 01:49:08 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Subfertility affects one in seven couples; a high proportion of them use assisted reproductive technology (ART) in an attempt to improve their chances of conception (<LINK REF="REF-Maheshwari-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maheshwari 2008</LINK>). In a natural cycle, only one oocyte is normally produced. Conversely, an ART cycle usually aims to produce more than one oocyte destined for fertilisation, to improve the chances of having a sufficient number of embryos to choose from. Concurrently, it is crucial to prevent an excessive response from the ovaries resulting in ovarian hyperstimulation. In order to produce more oocytes, the ovaries are stimulated with high doses of gonadotrophins. However, there is a risk of a premature surge of luteinising hormone (LH), which could disrupt both normal follicle and oocyte development, resulting in non-recovery of oocytes. The incorporation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocols has been used in ART to reversibly block pituitary function and prevent a premature LH surge. Use of GnRHa has resulted in significant improvements in treatment, including decreased cancellation of started treatment cycles prior to oocyte recovery and higher pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Fields-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fields 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-20 02:18:35 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Different GnRHa drugs, routes of administration (nasal or systemic), and GnRHa protocols have been used in ART. There are three main protocols involving GnRHa administration, namely, the long, the short, and the ultrashort protocol.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Long protocol: GnRHa is administered at least two weeks before starting stimulation (to achieve suppression of the ovarian activity) and continued up until human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) is given, starting from either the second day of the menstrual cycle (long follicular protocol) or the mid-luteal phase (21st day) of the previous cycle (long luteal protocol).</LI>
<LI>Short protocol: GnRHa is administered from day one or two of the cycle (day one being the start of the menstrual bleed) and continued with stimulation until the day of HCG administration.</LI>
<LI>Ultrashort protocol: GnRHa is given for three days, from day two of the cycle (hence, using only the flare-up effect).</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-20 02:20:05 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Administration of multiple doses of GnRHa causes a reversible blockade of pituitary function after an initial stimulatory phase, the so-called flare effect. GnRHa suppresses GnRH receptors and causes inhibition of postreceptor events (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2000</LINK>). The resulting reduction in bioactive LH levels in the serum (<LINK REF="REF-Regan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 1990</LINK>) allows multiple follicular development to continue (until ready for oocyte recovery) avoiding the risk of a LH surge and hence premature ovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>GnRHa are the most commonly used adjuvants for controlled ovarian stimulation (<A HREF="http://www.ivf-worldwide.com/survey/survey-the-use-of-gnrh-agonist-in-ivf-protocols-results.html">www.ivf-worldwide.com/survey/survey</A>). Traditionally, the long protocol involves GnRHa use during the entire stimulation phase until HCG administration. Reports showed that low endogenous LH concentrations persist until 10 to 14 days after discontinuation of the GnRHa (<LINK REF="REF-Donderwinkel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donderwinkel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sungurtekin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sungurtekin 1995</LINK>). Earlier studies have argued that continuation of GnRHa during the stimulation phase can also lead to profound suppression of mid-follicular LH, which might be associated with early pregnancy loss (<LINK REF="REF-Westergaard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westergaard 2000</LINK>). Therefore, GnRHa could be stopped earlier in the long protocol stimulation cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2005</LINK>), allowing the pituitary to recover in time for the luteal phase without risking a premature LH surge. This could reduce both cost and inconvenience as fewer injections would be needed.<BR/>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-20 02:20:39 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>The original Cochrane review on the topic, published in 1998 and updated in 2009, showed superiority of the long protocols compared with the short or ultrashort protocols. Of note, long protocols are traditionally used in ART, whereas most of the newer alternatives (e.g., antagonists or mild protocols) have been compared with them (<LINK REF="REF-Mancini-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancini 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohsen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohsen 2013</LINK>). The second update of this review aimed to examine whether evidence in the last three years on the relative effectiveness of the different GnRHa protocols used as adjuncts to hormonal ovarian stimulation for ART supports the conclusions of the first update.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-18 20:03:49 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Two review authors (AG and GB) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting), and other bias. A third review author (CS) resolved disagreements. We described all judgements fully and presented them in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables, including commentary about each of the domains. This led to an overall assessment of the risk of bias of included studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We searched for within-trial selective reporting, such as trials failing to report obvious outcomes or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow inclusion. We sought published protocols and compared the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-08-18 20:05:14 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>For dichotomous data (e.g., live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel&#8211;Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). For continuous data (e.g., number of oocytes retrieved), we calculated the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. Where data to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, our intention was to utilise the most detailed numerical data available that might facilitate similar analyses of included studies (e.g., test statistics, P values). We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they are presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-08-18 20:08:22 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>The primary analysis was per woman randomised; we included per-pregnancy data for some outcomes (e.g., miscarriage). We counted multiple live births (e.g., twins or triplets) as one live birth event.<BR/>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-08-20 02:30:30 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>In the case of missing data in the included studies, we contacted the original investigators by e-mail or post to request relevant missing information. (We sent a reminder if we had received no reply during the first 20 days.) We reported the data according to intention-to-treat principles wherever possible. We assumed that live births had not occurred in participants without a reported outcome. For other outcomes, we analysed only the available data.</P>
<P>If studies reported sufficient detail to calculate MDs but provided no information on the associated standard deviation (SD), we assumed the outcome to have a SD equal to the highest SD from other studies within the same analysis.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-19 00:13:32 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Before any meta-analysis was done, we judged whether there was sufficient similarity between the eligible studies in their design and clinical characteristics to ensure that pooling was valid. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in the results of trials by using the X test. A low P value (or a large X statistic relative to its degree of freedom) potentially provides evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effects and shows that results are not influenced by chance alone (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the I statistic to assess the impact of the heterogeneity on the meta-analysis and interpreted an I statistic &gt; 50% as marked heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).<BR/>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-19 00:14:21 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert to duplication of data. In the presence of 10 or more studies in an analysis, we used a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small study effects. This was to guide whether the difference was due to publication or reporting bias. We were aware that there are other sources of asymmetry in funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Stuck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuck 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was a wide variation in the dose, type, and route of GnRHa used for down-regulation in long protocols. Buserelin was used either by nasal spray or subcutaneous injections: 1000 킽 twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1991</LINK>); 200 킽 five times a day (<LINK REF="STD-Acharya-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Acharya 1992</LINK>); 900 킽/day (<LINK REF="STD-Loumaye-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Loumaye 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasdemir-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tasdemir 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ye-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ye 2001</LINK>); 300 킽 twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-De-Placido-1991" TYPE="STUDY">De Placido 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frydman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Frydman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hedon-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hedon 1988</LINK>); 200 킽 three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-van-de_x002d_Helder-1990" TYPE="STUDY">van de-Helder 1990</LINK>); 0.3 ml daily (<LINK REF="STD-Foulot-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Foulot 1988</LINK>); 200 킽 daily (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK>); and 100 킽/day (<LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK>). Decapeptyl was used either as a short-acting (100 &#956;g/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Cedrin_x002d_Durnerin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cedrin-Durnerin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chatillon_x002d_Boissier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chatillon-Boissier 2012</LINK>) or long-acting single intramuscular injection (3.75 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1988</LINK>) or 1.88 mg of intramuscular Diphereline (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>).

<P>In studies comparing a long protocol versus a short protocol, GnRHa was continued at the same dose until HCG administration except in five studies that reduced the dose at confirmation of down-regulation: reduced from 1000 킽 to 600 킽 (<LINK REF="STD-Dirnfeld-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dirnfeld 1991</LINK>), reduced from 1 mg to 0.5 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-San-Roman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">San Roman 1992</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chatillon_x002d_Boissier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chatillon-Boissier 2012</LINK> halved the agonist dose, and <LINK REF="STD-Sunkara-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sunkara 2014</LINK> continued with a reduced dose of nafarelin 200 mg twice daily until the administration of HCG injection.</P>
<P>Similarly, the dose of GnRHa for short protocols varied. <LINK REF="STD-Weissman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weissman 2003</LINK> applied a modified short protocol using the flare effect initially (500 &#956;g/day for the initial four days followed by 100 &#956;g until the day of HCG). <LINK REF="STD-Yang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1996</LINK> used another modification of the short protocol where GnRHa was stopped after seven days.</P>

<LI>The participants in the ultrashort gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/GnRH antagonist group (n = 41) were administered leuprolide acetate at 40 microg subcutaneously/twice daily, started on day two of menses and continued for three consecutive days, followed by gonadotrophins, and GnRH antagonist cetrorelix at 0.25 mg/day when the leading follicle was more than 14 mm, which was continued up to HCG injection.</LI>
<LI>The participants in the microdose group (n = 41) started to use leuprolide acetate at 40 microg subcutaneously/twice daily on day two of menses, and two days after initiation of GnRHa, gonadotropin stimulation was initiated and continued until HCG day.</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-20 00:30:37 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>The conclusion from the second update of this systematic review and meta-analysis is that there was no conclusive evidence that gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa)-long protocol was associated with an increase in live birth and ongoing clinical pregnancy rates in comparison with the GnRHa-short protocol, although there was moderate evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancy rates. The finding remained constant after performing sensitivity analysis, removing studies where the method of randomisation and the reporting of outcomes were unclear. Subgroup analysis including four trials studying poor responders only showed a difference in clinical pregnancy rates, number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rates, favouring the GnRHa-long protocol when compared with the GnRHa-short protocol.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing clinical pregnancy rates in comparisons of other protocols of GnRHa for pituitary down-regulation in assisted reproduction treatments.</P>
<P>Apart from two studies where there was evidence of a difference in the dose of gonadotrophins used when a GnRHa-short protocol was compared with a GnRHa-ultrashort protocol, and when a GnRHa-short protocol was compared with a GnRHa-stop short protocol, we found no evidence of any difference for any reproductive outcome (either primary or secondary) when GnRHa was commenced in the follicular phase compared with the luteal phase; stopped, reduced, or continued at the start of stimulation; continued or not after the oocyte triggering; or lasted for two or three weeks before stimulation.</P>
<P>Of note, there was very poor reporting of adverse events among studies in all comparisons, apart from cancellation rates.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-20 03:11:05 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>In the comparison of GnRH-long versus GnRH-short protocol regimens, despite the inclusion of 20 studies, there was no significant statistical heterogeneity (I = 25%), but, as in many reviews in assisted reproduction, there was evidence of clinical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The comparison between a luteal versus follicular start of GnRHa was based on five trials. None of them mentioned formation of a cyst, which has been shown to be associated with a follicular phase start of GnRHa (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1996</LINK>). There is controversy over whether cysts are associated with poorer outcomes. On the other hand, there is a risk of inadvertently exposing a pregnancy to GnRHa if administration is commenced in the luteal phase. Four per cent of cases of women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) have reported such a situation (<LINK REF="STD-Ron_x002d_El-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ron-El 1990</LINK>). None of the studies comparing luteal or follicular phase protocols commented on these outcomes.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the number of studies comparing various ways of GnRHa administration in a long protocol was small: three compared the stopping versus the continuation of GnRHa at start of stimulation, four compared the reduction versus the non-reduction of the dose during stimulation, one compared the administration for two versus three weeks before stimulation, and another compared the prolongation versus the stopping after the oocyte retrieval 12 days after the embryo transfer.</P>
<P>Similarly, there were few studies for the rest of the comparisons: two compared GnRHa-long versus ultrashort, one for short versus ultrashort, and one for short versus stop short protocols. Hence, the evidence is insufficient for these comparisons. Also, there were no data on cost effectiveness and acceptability of these protocols to women. Importantly, and as in many systematic reviews and especially Cochrane reviews, we noticed failure of most studies to report on live birth (four out of 20 in the comparison long versus short encompassing the maximum of studies) or adverse events. Moreover, some of the findings only apply to low responders, as this is an issue of applicability.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-02 00:11:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we included 37 studies in the review, most of them were very old. Only 10 were published within the last 10 years; two were published nine years ago (<LINK REF="STD-F_x00e1_bregues-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fbregues 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 2005</LINK>); one, seven years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Isikoglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Isikoglu 2007</LINK>); one, five years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>); one, four years (<LINK REF="STD-Berker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berker 2010</LINK>); and the remaining five, within the last two years (<LINK REF="STD-Chatillon_x002d_Boissier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chatillon-Boissier 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ding-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ding 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarhan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sarhan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sunkara-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sunkara 2014</LINK>). Because of the length of time elapsed, we were unable to contact most of the authors to get any missing data, such as the method of randomisation. Intention-to-treat analysis and an a priori power calculation were not features of any study except for very few in this review.</P>
<P>The general quality evidence for each comparison was low in almost all cases (see the 'Summary of findings' tables). Common limitations were failure to report live birth, risk of bias, and imprecision. Although statistical heterogeneity was not significant in most analyses, there was clinical heterogeneity, with a wide variation in the dose regimens and preparation of the GnRHa used.</P>
<P>For the first comparison 'long versus short protocol', the quality of the evidence was low for the primary outcome (12 studies), low for the secondary outcome 'Clinical pregnancy rate' (20 studies), and low for cancellation rate (11 studies) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We observed a significant variation in the outcomes 'Number of oocytes retrieved' and 'Number of ampoules of gonadotrophins', most probably due to the way that these data were presented, such that no pooling of data was performed despite an adequate number of trials (10 and eight studies, respectively). Ideally, we would like to do a subgroup analysis of prognostic factors for where there was significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) based on the number of embryos transferred, previous failed cycles, maternal age, and duration of treatment.</P>
<P>In the rest of the comparisons, the quality of the studies was low for those reporting on the primary and secondary outcomes specified for this review, where reported (in five out of the eight remaining).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-08-20 03:13:21 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>Through the standardised method of identification of studies, we included all relevant studies. We assessed bias according to the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and came to the conclusion that most studies were free of selective reporting. Almost all studies reported pregnancies (clinical). However, most of the studies (even the most recent) did not report live birth, which formed part of the primary outcome measure in this review. There has been considerable debate about what is the best outcome to report in assisted reproduction technology (ART) studies (<LINK REF="REF-Min-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Min 2004</LINK>). Although the most reliable effectiveness of an intervention in ART is nowadays considered the reporting of live birth rates, in the current review, the lack of such reporting weakens the robustness of the results obtained.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-11-04 22:31:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results for a GnRHa-long versus a GnRHa-short protocol, with pregnancy rate as the outcome, are similar to those in the previous published version of this review despite the fact that we excluded studies analysing gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) cycles, cross-over trials, and quasi-randomised trials (included in the last review) in this updated review. This updated review includes further comparisons that were not part of the initial review. These referred to the GnRH-long protocol: (1) luteal versus follicular start of GnRHa; (2) stopping and reducing the dose of GnRHa versus continuing the same dose; (3) administration of GnRHa for two versus three weeks before stimulation; and (4) discontinuing versus continuing GnRHa after HCG administration, and to the GnRH-short protocol (short versus stop short).</P>

<P>When long GnRHa protocols and short GnRHa protocols were compared, we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates, but there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol group. None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-02 00:13:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As adjuvants are almost always used in ART protocols, further research with high quality trials are needed to determine an optimal protocol (when to commence and stop GnRHa and its optimal dose), further identifying the most cost-effective and acceptable regimen. </P>
<P>We propose comparisons of these protocols using GnRHa in women stratified by type of subfertility and age. Most importantly, for all comparisons included in this review (nine), live birth, ongoing pregnancy rates, or both, should be the primary outcome reported, along with adverse events, as GnRHa protocols have been associated with high incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and miscarriage rates. Finally, further parameters should comprise the outcomes of interest, such as the acceptability of the regimens, their cost, and the woman's preference.</P>

<P>Our protocol mentioned one of the comparison groups as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) versus placebo. However, there is a review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Fields-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fields 2013</LINK>) suggesting that use of GnRHa is associated with a better outcome in assisted reproduction technology (ART). The current review intended to explore which protocol was better.</P>
<P>A short protocol versus a short stop protocol was not listed in the initial comparison groups. However, since we were looking at all protocols for GnRHa for pituitary down-regulation, we felt it was appropriate to include studies comparing these groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial characteristics</HEADING>
<P>(1) Method and timing of randomisation:</P>
<UL>
<LI>randomisation was adequate (e.g., by computer, random number tables, or drawing lots); or</LI>
<LI>not clear (e.g., stated but not further described, or did not fall into one of the randomisation categories).</LI>
</UL>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment.</P>
<P>(3) Duration, timing, and location of the trial (single centre or multicentre trial), duration of follow up, and:</P>
<UL>
<LI>outcome data used for primary analysis were complete (follow up to live birth), all randomised women were accounted for with an intention-to-treat analysis;</LI>
<LI>completeness of data uncertain; or</LI>
<LI>outcome data incomplete, with 5% of the cycles commenced missing some outcome data.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(4) Co-intervention:</P>
<UL>
<LI>other care provided with the intervention under study was equivalent in the treatment and control groups;</LI>
<LI>issue of co-intervention was not considered; or</LI>
<LI>co-intervention variations definitely existed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(5) The presence of a power calculation:</P>
<P>(a) yes (prospective and valid or not valid); or<BR/>(b) no.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Baseline characteristics of the studied groups</HEADING>
<P>(a) Cause and duration of pre-existing subfertility<BR/>(b) Age of the women and parity<BR/>(c) Investigative work-up prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF)<BR/>(d) Previously administered treatment(s)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>(a) Type of intervention and control comparator<BR/>(b) Dose and type of regime</P>
<P>(c) We differentiated between whether the studied population included all women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART) or was limited to women who had responded poorly in a previous attempt or were expected to have a diminished response. As different drug regimes of ovarian stimulation can lead to a variable ovarian response, data on the drugs employed was also extracted.</P>
