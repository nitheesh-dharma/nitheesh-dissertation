<P>Depression is the fourth leading cause of disease burden worldwide and is expected to show a rising trend over the next 20 years. Depression is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Sertraline, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is a potent and specific inhibitor of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic terminal, with a modest activity as inhibitor of dopamine uptake. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Fifty-nine randomised controlled trials (about 10,000 participants) were included in the review. The review showed evidence of differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between sertraline and other antidepressants, with meta-analyses highlighting a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressants, both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials, using conservative statistical methods. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Nevertheless, based on currently available evidence, results from this review suggest that sertraline might be a strong candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant in people with acute major depression.</P>

<P>A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-08 11:56:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression is the fourth leading cause of disease burden worldwide and is expected to show a rising trend over the next 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). This condition is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Major depression is generally diagnosed when a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure are accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). However, a proportion of people sometimes show an atypical presentation with reactive mood, increased appetite, weight gain and excessive sleepiness (<LINK REF="REF-Quitkin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quitkin 1991</LINK>). Somatic complaints are also very frequent, and people with severe depression may develop psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-10 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression (see below for references to the relevant evidence), in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Amongst ADs many different agents are available, including tricyclics (TCAs),heterocyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and newer agents (venlafaxine, mirtazapine, reboxetine). During the last 20 years, antidepressant consumption has risen dramatically in many Western countries, mainly because of the increase in consumption of SSRIs and newer ADs, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrenson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>SSRIs are generally better tolerated than TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2000</LINK>), and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2004</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparison provided contrasting findings. Amitriptyline, for example, may have the edge over SSRIs in terms of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>), and individual SSRIs may differ in terms of efficacy and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feiger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>). In a systematic review of 132 randomised controlled trials (RTCs) comparing fluoxetine with all other ADs, sertraline and venlafaxine were found to be slightly more effective than fluoxetine, both on dichotomous and continuous outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>). In terms of the number of patients who dropped out during the trial for any reason, a non-significant advantage favouring sertraline, but not venlafaxine, was observed. Interesting findings were also showed by Feiger and colleagues, who did not carry out a systematic review, but combined findings from five published or unpublished RCTs owned by the sertraline manufacturer (<LINK REF="REF-Feiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feiger 2003</LINK>). All RCTs compared sertraline with fluoxetine. Statistically significant differences in favour of sertraline were observed in the high severity subgroup only when a dichotomous outcome measure was used. Finally, indirect evidence of differences between SSRIs have been suggested by Smith and colleagues, who conducted a meta-analysis of 32 RCTs comparing venlafaxine with other ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>). In spite of an overall efficacy estimate significantly favouring venlafaxine over SSRIs as a group (-0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.27 to -0.08), among SSRIs only sertraline was not significantly less effective than venlafaxine (-0.31, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.06).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-08 11:21:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared with other SSRIs, sertraline is a potent and specific inhibitor of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic terminal, with a modest activity as inhibitor of dopamine uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Heym-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heym 1988</LINK>). Sertraline has minimal inhibitory effects on the major cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, mildly inhibiting the CYP2D6 isoform, and with little effect on CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (<LINK REF="REF-MacQueen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacQueen 2001</LINK>). Sertraline inhibits neither norepinephrine uptake nor monoamine oxidase activity and possesses no significant anticholinergic activity. For these reasons, since its discovery, sertraline has been thought to lack a number of biochemical actions that may sustain some of the undesirable effects of other ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Koe-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koe 1983</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-10 17:50:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To shed light on the field of antidepressant trials and treatment of major depressive disorder, a group of researchers agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants Study Group (MANGA Study Group) to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer antidepressant. As of October 2008, we have completed an individual review for fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>) and published the protocols for venlafaxine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007a</LINK>), escitalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007</LINK>), fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="REF-Omori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omori 2006</LINK>), citalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Imperadore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperadore 2007</LINK>), duloxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Nose-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nose 2007</LINK>), milnacipran (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2007</LINK>), paroxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007b</LINK>) and mirtazapine (<LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2007</LINK>). Thus, the aim of the present review is to assess the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with TCAs, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents, including non-conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2008</LINK>), in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.</P>

<P>Patients aged 18 or older, of both sexes with a primary diagnosis of major depression. Studies adopting any standardised criteria to define patients suffering from unipolar major depression were included.

ICD-9 is not based on operationalised criteria, because it has only disease names and no diagnostic criteria, so studies using ICD-9 were excluded. However, studies using Feighner criteria or Research Diagnostic Criteria were included. Studies in which less than 20% of the participants might be suffering from bipolar depression were included, but the validity of this decision was examined in a sensitivity analysis. A concurrent secondary diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered as exclusion criteria.</P>

Those studies which met the following criteria constituted the preliminary list and their full texts were retrieved:<BR/>The rough inclusion criteria were:<BR/>1) Randomised trial<BR/>2) Comparing sertraline against any other antidepressant<BR/>3) Patients with major depression, regardless of the diagnostic criteria used.</P>
<P>Studies relating to sertraline generated by the search strategies of CCDANCTR-References and the other complementary searches were checked independently by the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator (HMG), who is an author of this review, and another review author (AC, TL or AS) to see if they met the rough inclusion criteria, firstly based on the title and abstracts. All the studies rated as possible candidates by either of the two reviewers were added to the preliminary list and their full texts were retrieved. All the full text articles in this preliminary list were then assessed by two review authors (AC, TL or AS) independently to see if they met the strict inclusion criteria. If the raters disagreed the final rating were made by consensus with the involvement (if necessary) of another member of the review group. Non-congruence in selection of trials was reported as percentage disagreement. Considerable care was taken to exclude duplicate publications.</P>

<P>One review author (TL) first extracted data concerning participant characteristics (age, sex, depression diagnosis, comorbidity, depression severity, antidepressant treatment history for the index episode, study setting), intervention details (intended dosage range, mean daily dosage actually prescribed, co-intervention if any, sertraline as investigational drug or as comparator drug, sponsorship) and outcome measures of interest from the included studies. The results were compared with those in the completed reviews of individual antidepressants in the Cochrane Library.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-10 15:06:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool as recommended in RevMan 5.0.0. This instrument consists of six items. Two of the items assess the strength of the randomisation process in preventing selection bias in the assignment of participants to interventions: adequacy of sequence generation and allocation concealment. The third item (blinding) assesses the influence of performance bias on the study results. The fourth item assesses the likelihood of incomplete outcome data, which raise the possibility of bias in effect estimates. The fifth item assesses selective reporting, the tendency to preferentially report statistically significant outcomes. It requires a comparison of published data with trial protocols, when such are available. The final item refers to other sources of bias that are relevant in certain circumstances, for example, in relation to trial design (methodologic issues such as those related to crossover designs and early trial termination) or setting. </P>
<P>Two review authors (AC, AS) assessed trial quality independently in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Where inadequate details of allocation concealment and other characteristics of trials were provided, the trial authors were contacted in order to obtain further information. If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus with the involvement (if necessary) of another member of the review group. The ratings were also compared with those in the completed reviews of individual antidepressants in the Cochrane Library. If there were any discrepancies, these were fed back to the authors of the completed reviews.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2009-02-10 15:59:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: drop outs were always included in this analysis. Where participants had withdrawn from the trial before the endpoint, it was assumed they would had experienced the negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). When there were missing data and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. When dichotomous or continuous outcomes were not reported, trial authors were asked to supply the data.</P>
<P>When only the SE or t-statistics or p values were reported, SDs were calculated according to Altman (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). In the absence of supplemental data from the authors, the SDs of the HAM-D (or any other depression scale) and response/remission rates were calculated according to the validated imputation methods (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>).

<P>The primary analysis used a random effects model OR, which had the highest generalisability in our empirical examination of summary effect measures for meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002a</LINK>). The robustness of this summary measure was routinely examined by checking the fixed effect model OR and the random effects model risk ratio (RR).

<P>Subgroup analyses were planned. Subgroup analyses should be performed and interpreted with caution because multiple analyses can lead to false positive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>). We planned to perform the following subgroup analyses, where possible, for the following a priori reasons:<BR/>1) Sertraline dosing (fixed low dosage, fixed standard dosage, fixed high dosage; flexible low dosage, flexible standard dosage, flexible high dosage), because there was evidence to suspect that low dosage antidepressant might be associated with better outcomes both in terms of effectiveness and side effects than standard or high dosage antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002b</LINK>) and also because fixed versus flexible dosing schedule might affect estimates of treatment effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). In the case of sertraline, based on the Defined Daily Dosage by World Health Organisation (WHO), low dosage referred to &lt;10, standard dosage to &gt;10 but &lt;20, and high dosage to &gt;20 mg/day.<BR/>2) Comparator dosing (low effective range, medium to high effective range), as it was easy to imagine that there were greater chances of completing the study on the experimental drug than on the comparator drug that was increased to the maximum dosage<BR/>3) Depression severity (Severe major depression, moderate/mild major depression)<BR/>4) Treatment settings (psychiatric inpatients, psychiatric outpatients, primary care)<BR/>5) Older patients (&gt;65 years of age), separately from other adult patients.</P>

<P>The following sensitivity analyses were planned a priori. By limiting the studies to be included to those with higher quality, we examined if the results changed, and checked for the robustness of the observed findings.<BR/>1) Excluding trials with unclear concealment of random allocation and/or unclear double blinding<BR/>2) Excluding trials whose drop out rate was greater than 20%.<BR/>3) Performing the worst case scenario ITT (all the patients in the experimental group experience the negative outcome and all those allocated to the comparison group experience the positive outcome) and the best case scenario ITT (all the patients in the experimental group experience the positive outcome and all those allocated to the comparison group experience the negative outcome).<BR/>4) Excluding trials for which the response rates had to be calculated based on the imputation method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>) and those for which the SD had to be borrowed from other trials (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>).<BR/>5) Examination of "wish bias" (also called "optimism bias") by comparing sertraline as investigational drug vs sertraline as comparator, as there was evidence to suspect that a new antidepressant might perform worse when used as a comparator than when used as an experimental agent (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>).<BR/>6) Excluding studies funded by the pharmaceutical company marketing sertraline. This sensitivity analysis was particularly important in view of the recent repeated findings that funding strongly affects outcomes of research studies (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Procyshyn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Procyshyn 2004</LINK>) and because industry sponsorship and authorship of clinical trials have been increasing over the past 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Buchkowsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchkowsky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>If subgroups within any of the subgroup or sensitivity analyses turned out to be significantly different from one another, we ran meta-regression for exploratory analyses of additive or multiplicative influences of the variables in question.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-10 15:21:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though a number of findings indicated broad equivalence, some suggesting a direction of effect in favour of other antidepressants and some comparisons involving single trials only, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline both in terms of efficacy and acceptability in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-01-28 16:06:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has long been argued that placebo controlled trials are required to adequately demonstrate the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 2002</LINK>), however in the present review we focused only on the comparison between sertraline and other active treatments. Notwithstanding the well-known problem of study quality in antidepressant trials and the potentially confounding effect of sponsorship (see compariosons between sertraline and newer antidepressants, such as bupropion and mirtazapine), our results are consistent in favour of sertraline. Comparing antidepressants each other in terms of both efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, the direction of the effect favoured sertraline in the great majority of comparisons. This implies that the heterogeneity is quantitative rather than qualitative. In other words, findings from the present analysis expand previous evidence supporting the use of sertraline as a strong candidate in the first-line treatment of people with major depression.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-02-11 22:35:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the trials included were adequately reported for all items. Many items are recorded as &#8216;not clear&#8217; and thus assessment of &#8220;risk of bias&#8221; was difficult. Whilst the sequence generation procedure was judged to be adequate for the vast majority of trials, in contrast, very few trials reported on allocation concealment.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-02-10 16:10:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some limitations should be borne in mind. First, even though differences in this review were robust in terms of statistical significance, evidence coming from randomised trials may be of limited applicability to everyday clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Zwarenstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwarenstein 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondly, the possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out (<LINK REF="REF-Wittington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittington 2004</LINK>). For the meta-analyses of TCAs and SSRIs the funnel plots have generally been symmetrical, suggesting publication bias is absent. However, a review of trial data on children and adolescents with major depression suggested that publication bias may remain a very serious limitation to the entire literature comparing SSRIs and TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2003</LINK>). If important information is concealed, the funnel plot (and other formal statistical tests which work on the same principle) will not be able to detect publication bias under these circumstance. In this review we tried to include all available evidence either published or unpublished, searching trial databases of drug-approving agencies and trial registers, and also contacting pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is regrettable that in the present review only one RCT reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs are now available as generic versions, more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to inform health care policy.</P>
<P>Lastly, in this review we decided to focus on treatment response because it is one of the main goals for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The term &#8220;treatment response&#8221; describes a state of improvement in the patient&#8217;s condition of sufficient quality to result in the treating physician&#8217;s impression of at least a moderate degree of global improvement, conventionally defined as a reduction of at least 50% in depressive symptomatology (<LINK REF="REF-Thase-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thase 1990</LINK>). However, from a clinical point of view, the ultimate goal of the acute treatment phase of major depressive disorder may well be to achieve remission (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2002</LINK>). There is consensus that criteria for remission should include that the patient is asymptomatic (that is, not meet the criteria for diagnosis of the disorder and have minimal residual symptoms) and have an improvement in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Thus, one important limitation of the included trials (and consequently of the present review) is that only a few studies reported remission rates, underpowering the analysis and undermining the possibility to find significant differences between comparisons.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-11 22:34:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from the present analysis expand on previous evidence supporting the use of sertraline as a strong candidate for drug of choice in the first-line treatment of people with major depression. This is also true for individuals with medical comorbidity. NICE guidelines have recommended that sertraline should be considered the treatment of choice when initiating treatment in a patient with a recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina, as it has the most evidence for safe use in this situation (<LINK REF="REF-Glassmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glassmann 2002</LINK>). NICE recommendations are consistent with what has been observed in other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). More recently the report of the Canadian Cardiac Randomized Evaluation of Antidepressant and Psychotherapy Efficacy (CREATE) trial concluded that the first step in the treatment of patients with major depression and coronary artery disease should begin with sertraline or citalopram (plus clinical management) (<LINK REF="REF-Lesp_x00e9_rance-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesprance 2007</LINK>). These findings are backed by some observational evidence and by some pharmacoeconomic analyses of sertraline treatment of depression in patients with unstable angina or a recent myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2005</LINK>). In a national survey of cardiovascular physicians' beliefs and clinical care practices when diagnosing and treating depression in patients with cardiovascular disease, sertraline was the most frequently prescribed antidepressant (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 2006</LINK>). However, it should be borne in mind that there are a number of methodological complexities associated with research regarding depression and cardiovascular disease that can limit external validity of trial findings: difficulties in the definition and measurement of depression, complexities in the conduct of large-scale trials, ethical considerations surrounding the use of placebo and even the uncertainty regarding the pathophysiological link between depression and cardiovascular disease.</P>
<P>Another complex issue about antidepressants is the increased risk for suicidality (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007c</LINK>). In 2007 the Food and Drug Administration licensed a comprehensive report about the occurrence of suicidality in the course of treatment of adult patients with various antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2007</LINK>). This individual patient data analysis showed that the odds ratios for suicidality and suicidal behaviour attributable to antidepressant treatment in adults with psychiatric disorders were 0.83 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.00) and 1.10 (95% CI 0.77 to1.56), respectively. Among all antidepressants (either SSRIs, tricyclics or newer antidepressants, such as duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine and nefazodone) sertraline was the only agent with a favourable statistically significant risk over placebo (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.91 for suicidality risk and OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.90 for suicidal behaviour risk)(<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf</A>). In the current review there were insufficient data to be able to draw conclusions on lower or higher risk for suicidality between sertraline and other antidepressive agents.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-13 14:55:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forthcoming studies should focus on outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning. Cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Recognising the importance of addressing cost and acquisition issues with patients, appropriate economic analysis independent from pharmaceutical industry considering both costs and clinical outcomes should be carried out in the field of antidepressant trials, to improve physician knowledge about helping patients achieve affordable medication regimens.</P>
<P>The main methodological limitation of standard systematic reviews is that they can rely only on evidence from direct comparisons. However, given the wide spectrum of available comparisons for the treatment of major depression, the use of the methodology of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM) may help overcome this limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Lu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Salanti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salanti 2008</LINK>). MTM (also known as <I>network meta-analysis</I>) is a statistical method that enables to integrate data from direct comparisons (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how effective they are against a common comparator treatment) involving diverse regimens, and to assess the strength and consistency of the evidence. MTM has already been used in other fields of medicine and a review of a MTM comparing a group of antidepressants has been recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>).</P>
