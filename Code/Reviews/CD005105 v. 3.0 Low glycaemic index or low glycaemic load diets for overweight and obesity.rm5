<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There is a lack of consensus as to the best nutritional management of obesity. We assessed the effects of low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets in overweight or obese people. Six randomised controlled trials, involving 202 participants, were analysed. Interventions ranged from five weeks to six months duration. Participants receiving the low glycaemic index or load diet lost a mean of one kilogramme more than those on comparison diets. Lipid profile also improved more in participants receiving the low glycaemic index or load diet. No study reported adverse effects, mortality or quality of life data.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Obesity is increasingly prevalent, yet the nutritional management remains contentious. It has been suggested that low glycaemic index or load diets may stimulate greater weight loss than higher glycaemic index or load diets or other weight reduction diets.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of low glycaemic index or load diets for weight loss in overweight or obese people.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Trials were identified through <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and manual searches of bibliographies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing a low glycaemic index or load diet (LGI) with a higher glycaemic index or load diet or other diet (Cdiet) in overweight or obese people.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data, including any information provided on adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified six eligible randomised controlled trials (total of 202 participants). Interventions ranged from five weeks to six months duration with up to six months follow-up after the intervention ceased. The decrease in body mass (WMD -1.1 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.0 to -0.2, P &lt; 0.05) (n = 163), total fat mass (WMD -1.1 kg, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.4, P &lt; 0.05) (n =147) and body mass index (WMD -1.3, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5, P &lt; 0.05) (n = 48) was significantly greater in participants receiving LGI compared to Cdiets. The decrease in total cholesterol was significantly greater with LGI compared to Cdiets (WMD -0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.02, P &lt; 0.05), as was the change in LDL-cholesterol (WMD -0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.05, P &lt; 0.05). No study reported adverse effects, mortality or quality of life data.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Overweight or obese people on LGI lost more weight and had more improvement in lipid profiles than those receiving Cdiets. Body mass, total fat mass, body mass index, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol all decreased significantly more in the LGI group. In studies comparing ad libitum LGI diets to conventional restricted energy low-fat diets, participants fared as well or better on th LGI diet, even though they could eat as much as desired. Lowering the glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into a person's lifestyle. Further research with longer term follow-up will determine whether improvement continues long-term and improves quality of life.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-02 19:43:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-02 19:42:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Obesity is defined as an increase in body weight beyond the limitation of skeletal and physical requirement, as the result of an excessive accumulation of fat in the body. On the body mass index scale (Body Mass Index (BMI) = body mass (kg)/height (m<SUP>2</SUP>)), obesity can be defined as a BMI of greater than 30. Overweight is the borderline condition between normal weight and obesity and can be classified as a BMI of 25 to 30 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). However, the definition can vary from country to country, or from time to time.<BR/>The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Obesity is associated with higher rates of abnormal glucose tolerance, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Despite its prevalence, the prevention and management of obesity remains contentious.<BR/>Obesity is the single most frequent risk factor for type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Mokdad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokdad 2001</LINK>). As a result of the obesity epidemic, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing and is being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages (<LINK REF="REF-Dietz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silink-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silink 2002</LINK>). The increase in type 2 diabetes in obese people may relate to the relative insulin resistance obesity confers. Poorly controlled diabetes may be complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and vascular disease. Good glycaemic control is crucial to reduce the complications of disease, to improve the quality and duration of life and to minimise the need for expensive health care.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-02 19:42:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Currently, the nutritional management of overweight and obesity varies greatly due to a lack of consensus among clinicians as to the best approach. This in part reflects the lack of good quality trials. Clinicians have been "hampered by the lack of evidence-based evaluation and guidance on the range of interventions they might use (for obesity), ranging from diets, drug therapy, surgery, and innovations such as exercise on prescription" (<LINK REF="REF-Parliament-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parliament 2003</LINK>). Authors of a systematic review of low-carbohydrate diets found that there was insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against their use. They found that weight loss was associated with an overall decrease in caloric intake and longer diet duration, rather than reduced carbohydrate content per se (<LINK REF="REF-Bravata-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bravata 2003</LINK>). In two recent Cochrane systematic reviews in children, a variety of exercise, educational, dietary interventions and lifestyle adjustments were evaluated for preventing and treating obesity in children, indicating the numerous approaches available (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Summerbell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summerbell 2003</LINK>). However, the role of low glycaemic index diets for prevention or management of obesity was not within the scope of any of these reviews.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-02 19:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The glycaemic index factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1981</LINK>). Low glycaemic index foods, such as lentils, provide a slower more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream, thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycaemic index foods, such as white bread (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1981</LINK>). Hence, low glycaemic index foods may increase insulin sensitivity by minimising fluctuations in blood glucose levels and reducing the secretion of insulin over the day (<LINK REF="REF-Kiens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiens 1996</LINK>). There is some evidence that even when the kilo joule intake is the same, low glycaemic index food diets may stimulate more weight loss in obese people than high glycaemic index diets (<LINK REF="REF-Brand_x002d_Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brand-Miller 2002</LINK>). One review highlighted the possible usefulness of low glycaemic index foods in the management of obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Pawlak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawlak 2002</LINK>). However, there is controversy about their role. In another review looking at the outcomes of appetite, food intake, energy expenditure and body weight, the authors concluded that there is currently no evidence that low glycaemic index foods are superior to high glycaemic index foods in regard to long-term body weight control (<LINK REF="REF-Raben-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raben 2002</LINK>). However, this review included some studies that may have been underpowered, contained confounding factors or in which follow-up was too short to observe an effect.</P>
<P>The glycaemic load (GL) of a food is calculated as the carbohydrate content (g) multiplied by the glycaemic index value of the food and divided by 100: GL = CHO (g) x GI /100. The total glycaemic load of a menu is the sum of all the individual glycaemic load values for the foods in the menu (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-02 19:43:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Our systematic review may clarify issues surrounding the role of low glycaemic index or load diets in the management of obesity and overweight. If alterations in the glycaemic index or load of the diet alone can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease weight, or decrease poor health outcomes in obesity and overweight (including type 2 diabetes and its associated complications), then the use of low glycaemic index diets would have significant health and cost benefits for the community.</P>

<P>We excluded studies in which the intervention was only a generalised recommendation to increase the proportion of low glycaemic index foods in the diet, or to reduce the glycaemic load, without provision of explicit detail; studies in which the intervention was either not directly supervised or well-documented (for example by the use of food diaries or the provision of food); studies in which there was a co-intervention in the experimental group that was not also applied to the control group; studies in which the explicit aim of the study was not weight reduction; and studies in which the final outcome measurements for the intervention and comparator groups were not sampled at the same time point after the intervention. For example, one study defined the endpoint of the trial as the time when participants achieved 10% weight reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Pereira-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pereira 2005</LINK>) and was excluded from this review because the timing of the assessment ranged from six to ten weeks after the intervention.</P>

When a trial was excluded after this point, a record of the article, including the reason for exclusion, was retained (for details see 'Characteristics of excluded studies').

<LI>Minimisation of detection bias - were the outcome assessors blind to the intervention?

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-02 20:33:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We summarized the data statistically when they were sufficiently uniform and of sufficient quality. For dichotomous outcomes, we had planned to express the effect size in terms of relative risk with 95% confidence interval (CI), but there were no dichotomous outcomes relevant to this review.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated weighted mean differences. We extracted the baseline and post-intervention means with standard deviations (SD) (or standard error of the mean (SEM) or 95% CI) for the intervention and control groups and transformed any SEM or 95% CI into SD where appropriate. For trials where the results were given as mean changes from baseline, we recorded the absolute changes in outcome between baseline and post-intervention for both the control and intervention groups. If required, the mean difference could have been calculated by subtracting the control absolute change from the intervention absolute change. However, it would have only been approximate to calculate the estimate of variance for each of these changes [ = V<SUB>pre </SUB>+ V<SUB>post </SUB>- 2r(SE<SUB>pre</SUB> x SE<SUB>post</SUB>)], where V<SUB>pre</SUB> and SE<SUB>pre</SUB> are the variance and standard error of the mean baseline value; V<SUB>post </SUB>and SE<SUB>post</SUB> are the variance and standard error of the mean post-intervention value; and r is the correlation between baseline and post-intervention values. The variance of the total change could then have been calculated as the sum of the variance of the change in the intervention group and the variance of the change in the control group. As this involved approximations and owing to the small number of studies, this was not done (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We used mean results and absolute change results for the outcomes of interest.<BR/>
<BR/>When post-intervention measures of dispersion were not given (for example if the results were presented as percentage change from baseline), the baseline measures of dispersion were also used as the post-intervention values. This is a conservative approach, since variation at baseline should be larger than that at post-intervention, but this approach was only taken when the pre- and post- measures of dispersion for the same outcome were similar to each other in other trials. If the results were given on different scales, we used standardised mean differences. When data were only presented graphically, we obtained an estimate of the mean and SD from the graph.</P>

<P>Subgroup analysis was performed after excluding the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-McMillan_x002d_Price-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McMillan-Price 2006</LINK>) to determine its effect on the results. Subgroup analyses were planned according to age (18 years and less, over 18 years); sex (male, female); duration of the trial intervention (less than six months, six to twelve months, more than twelve months), difference between the glycaemic index or glycaemic load of the dietary intervention and that of the comparator, body mass (body mass index 25-29, greater than 30) and whether the comparator diet was a high glycaemic index or load diet, or an energy restricted reduced fat diet.

<P>From the initial search, 892 records were identified. From the abstracts of these, we identified 68 papers for examination of the full text. The other studies were excluded on the basis of their abstracts because they were not relevant to the question under study. Main reasons for exclusion were: articles were reviews, duplicate papers, the study had no control group or no randomisation, studies did not compare similar groups, the intervention was less than two weeks, weight loss was not the aim of the study, the trial endpoint was different in the two arms of the trial, the diets were both designed to be 'weight maintaining', or the participants were neither overweight nor obese.<BR/>Six studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bouche-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bouche 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMillan_x002d_Price-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McMillan-Price 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slabber-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Slabber 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sloth 2004</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:54:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This review indicates that weight loss was greater in overweight and obese people given low glycaemic index or load diets than in people given comparison diets, including higher glycaemic index or load diets and conventional weight loss diets. Similarly, loss of total fat mass and decrease in body mass index were significantly greater in the group receiving a low glycaemic index or load diet. The loss of 1-2 BMI units is clinically significant as is the weight loss observed with LGI diets (up to 7 kg during the intervention period). Improvements in the cardiovascular risk profile (indicated by a decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol) were significantly better with a low glycaemic index or load diet than a comparison diet.</P>
<P>Of the six studies included in this review (202 participants), two included obese people (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>
<B>; </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Slabber-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Slabber 1994</LINK>
<B>) </B>and compared low glycaemic index or load diets with conventional weight reducing low fat diets. Four studies included people with borderline normal weight (BMI=25) or overweight (BMI greater than 25 to 30) and compared a low glycaemic index or load diet with a higher glycaemic index or load diet. Only one study involved children.</P>
<P>In the two studies in which all the participants were obese (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slabber-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Slabber 1994</LINK>), the effects of the low glycaemic index or load diets were more apparent. For example the decrease in total fat mass was greater in the group receiving the low GI than the comparator diet (-4.2 kg, 95% CI -7.4 to -1.0, P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>). Similarly, the decrease in body mass index was greater with the LGI diet than the comparator diet in both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK>) (-1.8 BMI units, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.2, P &lt; 0.05) and (<LINK REF="STD-Slabber-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Slabber 1994</LINK>) (-1.1 BMI units, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.2, P &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Ebbeling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbeling 2003</LINK> also reported a significantly greater decrease in body mass with the LGI diet (-2.9 kg, 95% CI -5.4 to -0.5, P &lt; 0.05). Hence low glycaemic diets appear to be effective even in obese people who need to lose considerable amounts of weight. The added advantages of LGI diets are that they are simple to follow and they are more likely to result in satiety than other weight loss diets. Furthermore, provided people consume the right type of low GI foods, there is no need to limit the actual quantity of food to achieve weight loss. This is more conducive to good quality of life than a very restrictive diet.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:55:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The degree of overweight and obesity in the populations included in these studies was wide, suggesting that the results would be applicable in other developed communities. Only one study included children (n =16), so care would need to be taken in generalising results in the paediatric population.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:55:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Only six relevant randomised trials were identified and each had methodological limitations, including failure to conceal allocation and lack of blinding, which is difficult in dietary interventions. Furthermore, a range of comparator diets was used and the duration of the intervention was short. The two longest studies had a six month intervention with six month follow-up. Considering the brevity of the interventions the results observed are notable. One of the major challenges in weight management is sustainability of weight loss or maintenance of weight. Longer trials with increased lengths of follow-up will determine whether the improvements we report with LGI diets can be maintained and incorporated into lifestyle long-term.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Overweight or obese people on low glycaemic index diets lost more weight than those on high glycaemic index diets or conventional energy restricted weight loss diets, with the change in body mass, total fat mass and body mass index all significantly decreasing after the low glycaemic index diet compared to the comparison diet. It may be easier to adhere to a low glycaemic index diet than a conventional weight loss diet, since there is less need to restrict the intake of food as long as low glycaemic index carbohydrates are predominantly consumed. In studies comparing ad libitum reduced glycaemic index or load diets to conventional restricted low fat diets, even though participants could eat as much as desired on the low glycaemic index or load diets, they fared as well, or better, in the outcomes than those on the comparison diet. Hence, lowering the glycaemic index of foods in the diet appears to be an effective method of losing weight, particularly for the obese.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research with longer duration of follow-up is required to determine whether the improvements can be maintained long term. Future studies should investigate health-related quality of life (and adverse effects), since any change in diet is an interference with a person's life style. </P>
