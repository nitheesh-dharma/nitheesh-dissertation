Well done. I have changed an error in the abstract in relation to NNT for exacerbations (it now reads correctly that the risk is higher on LRTA not lower). Also changed wrong SD from SE in final study of final comparison (sugrouped FEV1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text for severity of asthma subgrouping was different from the result in the Forest plot (Test for subgroup differences: Chi&amp;#178; = 4.59, df = 1 (P = 0.03), I&amp;#178; = 78.2%), so I have changed this. Please check why there was a difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reveiewers responses to Emma's November 2011 notes are located on the workflows in a word doc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma notes 15/11/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on extracting and entering so much data and with so much accuracy in the text! I have made some copy editing changes throughout the review, but there are other changes that I would like you to see and check you are happy with. these have been done in tracked changes. I would be grateful if you could check you are happy with the changes and then accept them all globally before you carry on with your changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What outcomes does this statement relate to? &amp;quot;The superiority of inhaled corticosteroids over anti-leukotrienes was significantly greater in patients with moderate versus mild airway obstruction, similar in children and adults and not significantly influenced by the anti-leukotriene used, duration of intervention, quality of methodology, and funding source with no significant difference between.&amp;quot; I think the sentence needs to be split in two - it contains information about LTRA being more suitable for people with mild asthma (as stated in the PLS) and also about dose/type of drug. Splitting the sentence would allow it to be more nuanced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please see tracked changes and check you are happy with the proposal. I added in a heading for why it is important to do this review and clarified the language around updating the existing review.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You state that an 'advanced search of CENTRAL was also conducted'. Was this done? If so, please put the full search that was used into an appendix. If not, please delete this line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;who screened the full text articles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have put a protocol in the appendix. I think this is confusing for readers as it doesn't quite match that in the methods. therefore I have merged the two and incorporated the appendix text into the methods section (and double checked all the text). the only thing is the subgroup analyses did not quite match. Did you want to subgroup by triggers? Should this be a subgroup analysis but where you are unable to do so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please double check the equivalents doses as the ratios do not match between the two versions of the protocol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you clarify what were permitted co-medications and rewrite the paragraph under interventions if necessary? If this has changed form the previously published version of the review, this should be mentioned in the 'differences between protocol and review' section please.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No need to include so many excluded studies in the tables, it should only contain those that you would not be able to exclude simply on the basis of title and abstract alone - please delete some&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I changed die to 'twice a day'. Is this OK? b.i.d. is the usual abbreviation for this I think??&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;risk of bias. the numbers in the text do not match Figure 1. Could you please double check them against figure 1. I recommend printing out figure 1 to help you. Once you are happy with this, please double check the highlighted figures in the discussion section relating to the number of studies with high methodological quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please add the number of patients who contributed to the meta-analyses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I question whether it is worthwhile to include the forest plot on subgroup by publication status?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have added headings to break up secondary outcomes to help reader - and me editing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest move change from baseline symptom free days (outcomes 1.35 to 1.38) up to beneath outcome 1.29 to reflect the change in the text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For many of the forest plots with N=1 trial, you did not provide the summary statistic and instead wrote aggregation precluded. However, some you gave the summary statistics. can you be consistent? The latter are highlighted for your convenience - the meta-analysis will need to be turned off for these&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;heterogeneity: there are some quite significant measures of heterogeneity e.g. I2 = 69% for analysis 1.3 - however this information has not been discussed in the results section and a conclusion has been drawn without comment on heterogeneity. I2 = 99% in analysis 1.20 , the heterogeneity is caused by Maelstrom - the standard deviation is tiny compared to the other trials and this is quite probably because you have entered the standard error instead. Please check. Could you then check each forest plot an dif there is significant heterogeneity look and see if there is a trial with a small SD and investigate if you put in the SE my mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how did you arrive at this conclusion? These data appear robust as 180 new trials with no group difference would be needed to reverse these findings. An explanation would be helpful here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;there is repetition between the methods section of the table and the risk of bias table. I have done the first couple for you but could you please continue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;because you have used - to denote bullet points, some of the figures look like they are negative. I have reformatted the first table for you - if you could take out all the - signs that make it look negative, that would be good and the copy editor could reformat the table if absolutely necessary - although we would be grateful if you could do this yourself!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;references&lt;/b&gt;: there are many references where the volume is missing or there is some sort of other problem. Could you please run the validation report and amend as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOF&lt;/b&gt; - Are you going to create a summary of finding table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;10/2/2004 CJC&lt;br&gt;Peer review comments incorporated.: CHANGES ARE IN RED&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;search strategy widened a bit. also mono removed from therapy as this would exclude beta agonists!&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;Funding source (I have amended this as it read as if you were measuring how each trial was reported previously)&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Source of funding did not significantly influence results (Chi2 = 4.54 (2 df), P=0.10). Combining the results of trials published by producers of anti-leukotrienes gave equivocal results [6 trials: RR=1.38, (95% CI: 0.90, 2.12] whilst the combined results of trials published by producers of inhaled steroids reported greater effect of their own product [7 trials: RR=2.24, (95% CI: 1.44, 3.49) and the small trials with no industry funding reported no group difference, but the confidence intervals were wide [5 trials: RR=0.57, (95% CI: 0.12, 2.61, random effect).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Spellcheck has been run also.&lt;br&gt;Back to Toby to go onto the Library. Changes in red for Francine to see first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the details of Ng 2007 full paper as it found laterly&lt;br&gt;_____________ ______________________ ___________________________&lt;br&gt;5/1/2004 Approved by Francine and to go for Peer Review.&lt;br&gt;________________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;30/12 Response from CJC to Francine&lt;br&gt;1. I agree that NNH makes more sense and have amended this result in the abstract and results. The new figures are calculated from the Odds Ratios and a reference added to my paper in BioMedCentral.&lt;br&gt;2. Chi squared recalculated throughout using Peto OR&lt;br&gt;All changes for you to approve in red. Then Toby can send for Peer Review.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes for 2004,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re: NNH vs NNT; you clarified this very well. five questions/issues:&lt;br&gt;1. if I decide to select intervention=ICS, is there an easy way to calculate OR&lt;br&gt;from metaview or should I calculate it manually?&lt;br&gt;2. why not in this review report the NNH for LTRA, it is much better than NNT: I&lt;br&gt;would much prefer that.&lt;br&gt;3. is there any way to print the NNH figures from your software?&lt;br&gt;4. If we are to use OR for NNH or NNT, shouldn't we be consistent and use it&lt;br&gt;also for reporting the outcome? or better yet, report RR for the outcomes and&lt;br&gt;specify in methodology that ORs were used to calculate NNT and NNH?&lt;br&gt;5. I strongly believe that given the various ways to calculate NNT and NNH which&lt;br&gt;yield different results, we should always specify in the methodology how it was&lt;br&gt;calculated. It would help if you wrote a line to explain how your program&lt;br&gt;calculates it and referenced it for the whole group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re: Q stats. the message I get is that we need to use Peto Odds ratio for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. same comment as above. could you write a line for the whole group that would&lt;br&gt;be inserted in the methodology section and would specify that Peto OR were used&lt;br&gt;to calculate the difference between subgroups as per Deeks' method.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;br&gt;See figure 1 for the NNH figure for exacerbations. Technically as the intervention is ALA the NNH (number needed to harm) is 30 but I have clarified this by adding ICS to the NNT. If you had made ICS the primary intervention and ALA the comparison group it would be an NNT. This is another reason why I prefer Odds Ratios as the NNT will be the same both ways around, but may not be using RR. We can discuss this at the next update as well as the Q stats. I have not changed these as they are very similar using Peto OR. This will be mentioned in the next version of the handbook (section 8) - I hope.&lt;br&gt;This can go off for external review now. If you do not like the figure we can take it out.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 Dec 2003&lt;br&gt;Thanks for sorting out the Stelmach data Francine. The NNT figures are fine. Would you like me to add a smiley face graphic showing one or both of these as an additional figure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURE, SHOW ME WHAT IT'S LIKE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 Dec CJC Edit MANY THANKS FOR PUTTING YOUR CHANGES IN RED!&lt;br&gt;I have checked through the results and run spell check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;br&gt;There is a problem with the Deeks method and RR (please see below and think about what you wish to do about this if anything).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Asthma severity&lt;br&gt;Asthma severity on baseline also influenced the relative risk of exacerbations (c2 = 6.57 (1 dF), P&amp;lt;0.05). The superiority of inhaled steroids was clearly more apparent in patients with moderate airway obstruction, i.e., with a baseline FEV1 between 50% and 80% of predicted [10 trials: RR=2.15, (95% CI: 1.64 to 2.81)] than in those with mild obstruction, i.e., with baseline FEV1 &amp;#179;80% of predicted [7 trials: RR=0.83, (95% CI: 0.43 to 1.58)], ****although it did not reach our a priori definition of equivalence.**** One trial (Williams 2001Study A) which failed to report baseline airway obstruction was excluded from this subgroup analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Francine is the statement between the asterisks left over from a previous version? Does it need removal? YES, REMOVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Also I am concerned about the Chi squared results reported. They need to be done on Peto Odds Ratios to be completely accurate (due to an issue with the way Q statistics are currently calculated on RR in Revman). This does not alter the significance levels of the tests in this review where I have checked them, but could be criticised by industry. It would be safer to use the Q stats from Peto OR and mention this in the methods. DON'T HAVE TIME. PLEASE DO IT IF YOU WANT. I WOULD ONLY CHANGE IT IF' IT'S RIGHT TO DO IT: NOT TOO IMPRESSED BY INDUSTRY.. I'LL DO IT FOR THE NEXT REVIEWS, NOW THAT I KNOW. GIVE ME THE NEW REFERENCES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OUTCOMES REFLECTING CHRONIC ASTHMA CONTROL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant group difference (DELETE: of 110 to 250 mL) in the improvement from baseline in FEV1 was observed at all points in time in favour of inhaled corticosteroids : at 6 &amp;#177; 2 weeks [13 trials: Standardised Mean Difference (SMD)= -0.26, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.20, fixed effect model], at 12 &amp;#177; 4 weeks [8 trials: SMD= -0.25, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.11, random effect model], and at 24 or more weeks [4 trials: WMD= 130 mL, 95% CI: 80 to 180].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the first outcome to Standardised not Weighted! OK- ABSTRACT CHANGED TO: SEE RED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ADVERSE EFFECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no significant group difference in the number of patients who experienced &amp;quot;any adverse effects,&amp;quot; [N=15 trials, RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.04, fixed effect model], which met our definition of equivalence. There was also no significant difference in elevation of liver enzymes, [N=6 trials, RR=1.3, 95% CI: 0.7 to 2.3], headaches [N=16 trials, RR=0.9, (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.1], nausea [N=12 trials, RR=1.0, 95% CI: 0.7 to 1.5)], oral candidiasis [N=2 trials, RR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.02 to, 1.18], or death which was reported in only 1 trial. No heterogeneity was observed for any of the above outcomes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No difference changed to no significant difference. OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please come back to me on the Q stats and whether you would like the graphics added?&lt;br&gt;SEE ABOVE.&lt;br&gt;____________&lt;br&gt;THANKS,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANCINE&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 24 Oct 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution ; fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine BUT IS STELMACH AN SE RATHER THAN SD as it is out of balance with all the other studies? PLEASE RELOOK AT THIS PAPER AND CHECK WITH AUTHORS URGENTLY.&lt;br&gt;RECHECKED; YOU ARE RIGHT. ALL DATA CORRECTED&lt;br&gt;OUTCOMES CHANGED ARE: 01,09, 17, 33, and 48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis :fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Main results&lt;br&gt;27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration waried from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes with 4-8 weeks of treatment when the improvement in FEV1 reached 100 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL ]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I feel that the presentation of Relative Risk Increase as a percentage is misleading. The absolute difference is only a 3% increase in risk and this needs to be presented as well (perhaps as an NNT). Similar comment about the exacerbation requiring steroids where the absolute difference is 4% (NNT of 25 roughly).&lt;br&gt;GOOD POINT. NNTs ADDED. BY THE WAY THE NNT FOR EXACERBATIONS WAS CHANGED AS WITH RD THE RANDOM EFFECT (RATHER THAN FIXED EFFECT) APPLIED.&lt;br&gt;PLEASE VERIFY NNTs in RED. when I CALCULATE NNT FOR WITHDRAWALS DUE TO POOR ASTHMA CONTROL USING THE RD (RANDOM EFFECT MODEL) MY NNT IS 30. WHEN USING YOUR NNTONLINE PROGRAM, IT IS 47, AND WHEN I USED YOUR NNT PROGRAM BASED ON RR OF 2.58 (FIXED EFFECT), IT IS 30 OR RR OF 2.44 (RANDOM EFFECT), IT IS 33. HELP!! WHICH ONE DO I REPORT, WHERE DO I FIND THE CI WITH YOUR NNT? WHY THE DISCREPANCY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAME ISSUE WITH NNT FOR EXACERBATIONS. USING RD (RANDOM EFFECT) ON METAVIEW, MY NNT IS 33. WHEN USING NNTONLINE WITH RR OF 1.65 (FIXED EFFECT), NNT IS 30, RR OF 1.62 (FIXED EFFECT) -&amp;gt;NNT IS 31 AND WHEN USING RD OF 0.03 (RANDOM EFFECT), THE NNT IS 34. I UNDERSTAND THAT STUDIES WITH NO EVENT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE RR CALCULATION AND INCLUDED IN THE RD CALCULATION BUT STILL NOT SURE WHICH OF THE 4 MODES OF CALCULAATION IS RIGHT???&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;methods FINE&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results NOT ASSESSED UNTIL STELMACH ISSUE IS RESOLVED...&lt;br&gt;RESOLVED. THE ONLY CHANGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN RED. BACK TO YOU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action ; BACK TO CHRIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENJOY&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;18Nov2003 CJC further assessment.&lt;br&gt;Francine,&lt;br&gt;I am afraid that I still cannot believe the data presented from the Stelmach paper. It does not seem to match what is published in the paper so I assume the authors gave it to you. The SDs are way out of line with all the other studies and do not tally with the SD that comes from the CI from the after treatment results that are published. This means that too much weight goes to Stelmach and this skews the whole meta-analysis. The SMD for Stelmach is still much bigger than the other studies.......... All the other studies have an SD that is at least as large as the mean!&lt;br&gt;OTPIONS: leave out Stelmach for now? Ask for the raw data? At the very least I would want to see how these SD have been derived exactly.&lt;br&gt;The NNT will vary with the method of calculation, there is not one that is correct. I would calculate it using RR and choose the FE or RE according to the one you use for the analysis. The upper and lower CI are calculated from the CI of the RR and the CER in the analysis. The NNT is best reported with the CER used (as this is time and severity dependent).&lt;br&gt;In practice we are not going to get this one on for the deadline, but we MUST sort out the Stelmach data before this gets published.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;22/2/2002 CJC final look&lt;br&gt;Abstract data checked and matches Metaview.&lt;br&gt;Chi squared explanation and handling the Hughes data are fine: I have just added this to the latter &amp;quot;(in order to avoid counting the patients twice).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Consumer advisor also included in acknowledgements.&lt;br&gt;This all looks fine now and I will pass this version on to Paul.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEB 15, 02&lt;br&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br&gt;I received your email.

No cross-over trials so no problems with analysis in this respect.&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels: - One set of missed labels inserted and totals switched off when only one study contributes to an outcome.&lt;br&gt;OK. I DID THE SAME FOR OUTCOME # 23&lt;br&gt;Is there really a 99% change in rescue free days in one of the studies&lt;br&gt;YES&lt;br&gt;(or are some of these absolute and some changes - in which case we need an SMD). NO&lt;br&gt;Labels on graph reversed for Outcome 30 to be the same as the other QOL graphs and labels changed from BDP to ICS on graphs for the sake of consistency.&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;br&gt;Synopsis:- Fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;br&gt;What's New - Very Helpful&lt;br&gt;THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: -&lt;br&gt;The abstract results have been changed to match in with the full text (the numerical results had not been updated!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Background references have been taken out of the text and put into other references.&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;br&gt;Results: &amp;quot;Thirty-three (95% CI: 16, infinity) patients need to be treated with inhaled steroids instead of anti-leukotrienes to prevent one exacerbation requiring systemic steroids.&amp;quot; This is from the pooled RD which is very heterogeneous and would be better reported as NNT of 28 (114 to 14) using the Relative risk and the pooled control event rate. See www.nntonline.net under Visual Rx for an online programme to do this. I have altered the text accordingly.&lt;br&gt;THIS IS NICE. HOW DO YOU GET THE CI? WHY ARE THE RESULTS DIFFERENCE FROM THAT OF THE POOLED RD AS I HAD DONE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subgroups on ICS for BDP and FP do not have a significant difference between the subgroups (as far as I can see) so perhaps this needs to be toned down a bit?&lt;br&gt;LET ME MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS: I DESELECTED THE DATA FOR MONTELUKAST 5 MG AND PRANLUKAST IN ORDER TO COMPARE MONTELUKAST 10 MG DIE (X2= 11.2) VS. ZAFIRLUKAST 20 MG BID (X2=0.6). THE TOTAL X2=13.66. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS BECAUSE THE RESIDUAL X2=13.66-11.8=1.86 (1 DF)-&amp;gt; P&amp;gt;0.10.

Of the 7 trials, I deselected the two trials (Busse and Malmstrom).reporting data as % change instead of change in L so that I could report WMD as for the same outcome at 6, 24 and 37 weeks ; Results: 5 trials WMD= - 11 L (0.2, 0.02)&lt;br&gt;- you used the cut-off of 0.05 for heterogeneity, that's why you changed the fixed effect for random effect in FEV1 at 24 weeksright?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-For secondary outcomes, I only wanted to use the Hughes study once because the control group contributed twice to the data: it's a 3-arm study (FP vs. BDP vs AL). this is why there is only 6 and not 7 trials at 6 weeks (outcome 5), 8 instead of 9 (outcome 17), 4 instead of 5 trials (outcome 24), 3 instead of 4 trials (outcome 33), 12 instead of 13 trials (outcome 41). I realise that I was not consistent and did not deselect one of the Hughes's arm for the adverse effect. There is two ways to doing it: always reporting the data with use of AL group twice or only using hte control group once which I did. What do you suggest? Because of the small sample size, there is no or minimal difference (in the second decimal) when we remove one of the arm.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-20 14:40:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhupendrasinh F Chauhan">
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow because of muscle spasms (bronchospasm), inflammation (swelling) and mucus secretion phlegm. The airway passage narrowing results in breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered the gold standard to reduce the airway inflammation in adults and children with asthma. Anti-leukotrienes (5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene receptors antagonists) are anti-inflammatory drugs that may have fewer adverse effects than inhaled corticosteroids. The review suggests that anti-leukotrienes are safe, but less effective than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-11-15 17:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Bhupendrasinh F Chauhan">
<P>We included randomised trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids as monotherapy for a minimum period of four weeks in patients with asthma aged two years and older.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-26 15:23:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted data. The primary outcome was the number of patients with at least one exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included patients with at least one exacerbation requiring hospital admission, lung function tests, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and biological inflammatory markers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Sixty-five trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Fifty-six trials (19 paediatric trials) contributed data (representing total of 10,005 adults and 3,333 children); 21 trials were of high methodological quality; 44 were published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild or moderate persistent asthma. Trial durations varied from four to 52 weeks. The median dose of inhaled corticosteroids was quite homogeneous at 200 µg/day of microfine hydrofluoroalkane-propelled beclomethasone or equivalent (HFA-BDP eq). Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (N = 6077 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17, 1.96). For every 28 (95% CI 15 to 82) patients treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids, there was one additional patient with an exacerbation requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids. The magnitude of effect was significantly greater in patients with moderate compared with those with mild airway obstruction (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.41, 2.91 <I>versus</I> RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97, 1.61), but was not significantly influenced by age group (children representing 23% of the weight <I>versus</I> adults), anti-leukotriene used, duration of intervention, methodological quality, and funding source. Significant group differences favouring inhaled corticosteroids were noted in most secondary outcomes including patients with at least one exacerbation requiring hospital admission (N = 2715 participants; RR 3.33; 95% CI 1.02 to 10.94), the change from baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (N = 7128 participants; mean group difference (MD) 110 mL, 95% CI 140 to 80) as well as other lung function parameters, asthma symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, the quality of life, parents' and physicians' satisfaction. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control (N = 7669 participants; RR 2.56; 95% CI 2.01 to 3.27). For every thirty one (95% CI 22 to 47) patients treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids, there was one additional withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not significantly different between both groups.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-20 14:39:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As monotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids display superior efficacy to anti-leukotrienes in adults and children with persistent asthma; the superiority is particularly marked in patients with moderate airway obstruction. On the basis of efficacy, the results support the current guidelines' recommendation that inhaled corticosteroids remain the preferred monotherapy. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-08 10:59:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Asthma is a condition that affects the airways, it is characterised by bronchoconstriction and underlying inflammation. Infiltration of bronchial airways with eosinophils and neutrophils with release of inflammatory mediators is characteristic of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1993</LINK>). The cysteinyl leukotrienes are considered as the most potent inflammatory mediators in asthma. They are produced by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid metabolism. These mediators stimulate the production of airway secretions, cause micro vascular leakage and enhance eosinophilic migration in the airways; thus, leukotrienes are believed to play a pivotal role in mediating bronchoconstriction and inflammatory changes in the pathophysiology of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Peters_x002d_Golden-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters-Golden 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>All recent consensus statements on asthma advocate aggressive treatment of airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>). Although several drugs such as ketotifen, sodium cromoglycate and sodium nedocromil have anti-inflammatory properties, inhaled glucocorticoids remain the cornerstone of asthma management because of their efficacy, tolerability and rapid onset of action (<LINK REF="REF-Spahn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spahn 1996</LINK>). Prolonged low dose administration of inhaled corticosteroids is generally considered safe, although there is considerable concern about the long-term effects of steroids among some consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2010</LINK>). However, when moderate or high doses are required to control symptoms, adverse effects such as growth stunting in children (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 2006</LINK>), suppression of the adrenal axis (<LINK REF="REF-Bisgaard-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisgaard 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillip-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillip 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padfield 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Z_x00f6_llner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zöllner 2007</LINK>), and osteopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heuck-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuck 1997</LINK>) may be observed.</P>
<P>Anti-leukotrienes form a class of anti-inflammatory drugs that interfere with leukotriene production (5-lipoxygenase inhibitors) or with leukotriene receptors (leukotriene receptors antagonists, LTRAs). Anti-leukotrienes have the advantage of being administered orally in a single or twice daily dose and importantly, seem to lack the adverse effects on growth, bone mineralization and adrenal axis, associated with long-term or high-dose systemic glucocorticoid therapy.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-26 15:25:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>) summarised the accumulating evidence derived from 25 randomised controlled trials (three paediatric and 22 adult) and concluded that low doses of inhaled corticosteroids were superior in efficacy than anti-leukotrienes. With the publications of several new randomised controlled trials especially in children, an update of the systematic review was deemed useful to review the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotrienes as monotherapy as compared to inhaled corticosteroids and to provide better insight into the influence of patient and treatment characteristics on the magnitude of effects.</P>
<P>In addition, several national guidelines currently advocate their use as second choice monotherapy after inhaled corticosteroids in patients with mild asthma and as adjunct therapy with inhaled corticosteroids as an alternative of combination of long acting &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Reference lists of all identified RCTs were checked to identify potentially relevant citations. In addition, between 1998 and 2003, we searched abstract books of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society Meetings; we contacted the international headquarters of pharmaceutical companies producing anti-leukotrienes; and enquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies known and/or supported by these companies or their subsidiaries were made so that these results could be included in our 2003 review. In 2010, we searched the websites of pharmaceutical companies that are producers or distributors of inhaled corticosteroids or anti-leukotrienes for any posted report of potential relevant trials.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-03-26 15:26:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Both review authors extracted data independently (BFC and FMD) and we dealt with disagreement by consensus. We consulted authors and the funding pharmaceutical companies for confirmation of data extraction for all included trials where necessary.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the eligible studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This instrument evaluates the reported quality of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.</P>
<P>We previously used the five-point scoring instrument proposed by with the Cochrane Classification 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. Based on revised recommendations from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, </I>we assessed the risk of bias for each eligible study according to six pre-specified domains (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Both review authors performed this quality assessment independently. We resolved disagreement by consensus. We sought confirmation of methodology for included trials directly from the authors or the funding pharmaceutical companies. We assessed risk of bias against the following domains.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation generation. The method used to allocate participants to treatment group (e.g. computer-generated random number sequences).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment. The method used to conceal the sequence of treatment group assignment from study investigators and participants (e.g. assignment by date of birth, opaque sealed envelopes).</LI>
<LI>Blinding. The method by which knowledge of treatment group assignment was concealed from study investigators and participants after the study began (double-blind, single-blind).</LI>
<LI>Completeness of outcome data. The method for handling data from participants who withdrew from the study (e.g. intention-to-treat analysis, available case).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting. Whether there was evidence that outcomes measured in the study were unreported (e.g. unreported harms, relevant efficacy data that were not available due for reporting and not statistical reasons).</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias. Any other aspect of the study design which may be a source of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We collected and reported information for each domain of bias and provided a judgment based on this information as high, low or unclear risk of bias. We considered reported data with low risk in bias for the three main parameters (randomisation, blinding and low withdrawal rate in both groups) as high quality data for sensitivity analysis (see below).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-03-26 15:36:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We summarised differences between groups in event rates, such as number of exacerbations in a specific period, using either a ratio of rates or relative risk when pertaining to "one or more" events per patient. In continuous outcomes, such as pulmonary function tests or symptom scores, we used the mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD) method as indicated to estimate the individual and pooled effect sizes. We reported all estimates with their 95% confidence interval and performed meta-analysis using Reference Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies designed to test equivalence in treatment efficacy require a different analytical approach to that used for trials in which the hypothesis under test is that one treatment has greater efficacy than its comparator. This is because small trials may favour the conclusion that there was no difference between treatments, since the confidence intervals for the two treatments will be wide and therefore more likely to include the line of no difference between the two treatments. We set limits of treatment efficacy at +/- 0.10 on either side of the no-difference line for the number of patients with at least one exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. The null hypothesis tested whether the confidence interval for the difference between the two treatments included one of these limits.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-26 15:40:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We tested homogeneity of effect sizes between pooled studies using the DerSimonian and Laird method or the I<SUP>2</SUP>, which estimates the amount of statistical variation between the studies above what would be expected with the play of chance (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/">Cochrane Handbook</A>). We set values of P greater than 0.05 or I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 25% as providing an indication of significant heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was suggested by one or both statistical methods, we applied the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to the summary estimates (available in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan</LINK>).

We derived the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) from the pooled Odds Ratio using Visual Rx (www.nntonline.net). We used this method because the resulting NNTB or NNTH is independent of the way that the data are entered, which is not the case for relative risk (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Twenty-one (33%) trials on 6077 participants contributed to the primary end point; people with at least one exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. Compared with inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with anti-leukotrienes had a 51% increased risk of experiencing one or more exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (Risk ratio (RR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17, 1.96; random-effects model), that is, from 7% to 11% (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number need to treat to prevent one more exacerbation requiring corticosteroid (NNT) is 28 (95% CI 15 to 82; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There was no evidence of systematic bias identified by the test for funnel plot asymmetry (intercept 0.33, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.75; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The fail-safe N (the number of unpublished studies with null results needed to negate the current finding) was 180 trials. Selecting only one inhaled corticosteroid group (BDP or FP) as comparator in the three-group Hughes trial fail to affect the overall estimate due to the absence of events in this study. There was heterogeneity between and within anti-leukotrienes, the following subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed on the main outcome to explore possible effect modifiers.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>In adults and children with mild to moderate airway obstruction due to persistent asthma, four to 52 weeks of treatment with daily oral anti-leukotrienes carries a 51% increased risk (from 7% to 11%) of an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids than treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a median dose of 200 HFA-BDP eq. Twenty-eight people need to be treated with inhaled corticosteroids rather than anti-leukotriene to prevent one person from experiencing an exacerbation requiring corticosteroid i.e. the NNT is 28. These data appear robust as 180 new trials with no group difference would be needed to reverse these findings.</P>
<P>The baseline severity of asthma obstruction significantly influenced the magnitude of response; indeed, the risk of exacerbation requiring rescue systemic steroids was increased by 'two-fold' in patients with moderate airway obstruction treated with anti-leukotrienes rather than inhaled corticosteroids, while the risk was increased by 25% in patients with mild asthma obstruction. The magnitude of the risk was not significantly influenced by age, choice of anti-leukotrienes, duration of intervention, publication status, methodological quality, funding source and dose of inhaled corticosteroids in HFA-BDP eq.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes clearly favoured the use of inhaled corticosteroids over anti-leukotriene agents in adults and children. There was a three-fold increase in the risk of patients experiencing an exacerbation requiring hospital admission when treated with anti-leukotriene agents compared with inhaled corticosteroids. With regards to other indicators of asthma control, inhaled corticosteroids were more effective than anti-leukotrienes in improving lung function (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and PEFR), the percentage of symptom-free and rescue-free days, as well as in reducing symptoms, night-time awakenings and rescue &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use. These group differences were generally present at all points in time over four to 52 weeks of treatment.</P>
<P>The risk of overall adverse effects was similar in both treatment groups, meeting our <I>a priori</I> definition of equivalence. There was also no group difference in the following specific adverse effects, namely liver enzyme elevation, headaches, upper respiratory infections, oral candidiasis, nausea, and death. Anti-leukotriene use was not associated with an increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, adverse effects typically associated with inhaled corticosteroids such as growth suppression (in children), osteopenia and adrenal suppression were seldom measured except in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sorkness-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sorkness 2007</LINK>, in which growth was measured), thus preventing a fair comparison of the safety of long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids <I>versus</I> anti-leukotrienes.</P>
<P>The increased risk of all-cause withdrawals was significantly higher among patients treated with anti-leukotriene agents as compared to inhaled corticosteroids. Most of the increased risk seems attributable to increased withdrawals due to poor asthma control with the use of anti-leukotrienes which indirectly supports the superiority of inhaled corticosteroids over anti-leukotrienes.</P>
<P>The results of this review pertain to asthmatic adults and children with a mild or moderate persistent asthma. The results can apply to school-aged children; 19 trials with paediatric and adolescents contributed data to the review of which six trials (23% of the weight of the summary estimate) contributed to the primary outcome. The relatively modest number of trials could fall in the priori defined category of high methodological quality indicates either poor designing of trials or inadequate reporting of methodology. More long-term trials are needed to compare the safety of anti-leukotrienes <I>versus</I> inhaled corticosteroids as monotherapy in the treatment of paediatric asthma, as only one trial reported growth or effect of long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids in paediatrics.</P>
<P>This review summarises the best evidence available until December 2010. With a total of 56 trials (37 adult and 19 paediatric), it represents a significant update from the previous update in August 2003 which was based on 25 trials (22 adult and three paediatric). With 16 more paediatric trials than in the prior review, the current data more adequately represents children; paediatric trials represent now 23% of weight of the primary outcome compared with 6.7% in the prior review. While the results remain admittedly notably influenced by adults, the absence of a significant group difference between adults and children would support that the conclusion apply to both age groups. Twenty-one (38%) of 56 trials contributing data to the meta-analysis were of high reported methodological quality as per our predefined criteria using the Cochrane Classification 'Risk of bias' tool (29% of paediatric and 71% of adult trials); the impact of the large proportion of lower reported methodological quality on study results is unclear but could have led to an overestimation of the true effect. On the other hand, the robustness of the study results is supported by the fail-safe N of 180 trials indicating the number of unpublished/future studies with no group difference in rescue oral corticosteroids needed to change the direction of the current findings. Consequently, in line with the previous version, the present review confirms the greater efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids administered at a median dose of 200 HFA-BDP eq over anti-leukotrienes in children and adult with mild and moderate persistent asthma.</P>

<P>In symptomatic adults and children with mild or moderate asthma, anti-leukotrienes are less effective than inhaled corticosteroids at a median dose of 200 HFA-BDP eq for preventing exacerbations and achieving asthma control; the superiority of ICS is particularly marked in patients with moderate<I> versus</I> mild airway obstruction but does not appear influenced by age, duration of intervention, or anti-leukotriene used. The use of anti-leukotrienes is associated with a 51% increased risk of experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, a three-fold increased hospital admission rate and more than a two-fold increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control compared to inhaled corticosteroids. The superiority of inhaled corticosteroids was also observed in lung function, symptoms, use of rescue &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, quality of life, inflammatory markers and withdrawals including withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Although anti-leukotrienes have a similar safety profile to that of inhaled corticosteroids, one must note that adverse effects typically associated with inhaled corticosteroids such as growth suppression (in children), osteopenia and adrenal suppression have not been measured in these trials. On the basis of efficacy, the results support the current guidelines' recommendation that inhaled corticosteroids remain the preferred monotherapy in adults and children with persistent asthma.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-26 16:08:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>There is little need for additional efficacy studies in this area, other perhaps than to determine the exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes, which is clearly less than 200 &#956;g/day of HFA-BDP eq or to compare the safety profile (on growth) in children. Acknowledging the low and potential differential adherence rate to daily controller therapies, one area of interest is certainly examining the real-life effectiveness of low-dose daily inhaled corticosteroids compared to anti-leukotrienes,</P>
<P>Long-term high methodological quality trials with adequate documentation of adverse effects associated with inhaled corticosteroids are needed to provide a fair comparison of the safety of both treatment options. Future trials should aim for the following design characteristics:</P>
<UL>
<LI>pragmatic effectiveness trials;</LI>
