<P>Review question</P>
<P>This review compared the efficacy, safety and acceptability of methods used to destroy the lining of the womb in order to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women.</P>
<P>Background</P>
<P>Drugs or hysterectomy (removing the womb) used to be the main options for women having problems with heavy menstrual bleeding. In recent decades, surgical techniques have been developed that remove only the lining of the womb (endometrium). These techniques involve either cutting out the endometrium (resection) or destroying it with thermal energy from a laser, electric instruments or other devices (ablation).</P>
<P>Study characteristics</P>
<P>This review identified 25 randomised controlled trials undertaken in 4040 women. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of study quality varied among the trials. The evidence was current to June 2013. Eighteen of the 25 trials acknowledged receipt of funding, supply of equipment or technical assistance.</P>
<P>Key results</P>
<P>The review has not found that any of these procedures are better than any other in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding, and satisfaction was high with all procedures. The more modern devices (second-generation ablation) took less time to perform than the older first-generation devices and were more likely to be performed under local anaesthesia when the woman was awake. Side effects were generally similar and mostly mild.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence</P>
<P>Studies were of low or moderate quality. Few studies were blinded, data were limited, and there was substantial heterogeneity in some outcomes, leading to downgrading of the quality of the evidence.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:05:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a significant health problem in premenopausal women; it can reduce their quality of life and cause anaemia. First-line therapy has traditionally been medical therapy but this is frequently ineffective. On the other hand, hysterectomy is obviously 100% effective in stopping bleeding but is more costly and can cause severe complications. Endometrial ablation is less invasive and preserves the uterus, although long-term studies have found that the costs of ablative surgery approach the cost of hysterectomy due to the requirement for repeat procedures. A large number of techniques have been developed to 'ablate' (remove) the lining of the endometrium. The gold standard techniques (laser, transcervical resection of the endometrium and rollerball) require visualisation of the uterus with a hysteroscope and, although safe, require skilled surgeons. A number of newer techniques have recently been developed, most of which are less time consuming. However, hysteroscopy may still be required as part of the ablative techniques and some of these techniques must be considered to be still under development, requiring refinement and investigation.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-30 00:06:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the efficacy, safety and acceptability of of endometrial destruction techniques to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in premenopausal women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:08:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo, (from inception to June 2013). We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved studies, and made contact with experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ablation devices.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:11:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different endometrial ablation techniques in women with a complaint of HMB without uterine pathology were eligible. The outcomes included reduction of HMB, improvement in quality of life, operative outcomes, satisfaction with the outcome, complications and need for further surgery or hysterectomy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:13:29 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. Attempts were made to contact authors for clarification of data in some trials. Adverse events were only assessed if they were separately measured in the included trials. Comparisons were made with individual techniques and an overall comparison between first and second-generation ablation methods was also undertaken.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 21:59:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Twenty five trials (4040 women) with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 372 were included in the review. A majority of the trials had a specified method of randomisation, adequate description of dropouts and no evidence of selective reporting. Less than half had adequate allocation concealment and most were unblinded.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to suggest superiority of a particular technique in the pairwise comparisons between individual ablation and resection methods.</P>
<P>In the overall comparison of the newer 'blind' techniques (second-generation) with the gold standard hysteroscopic ablative techniques (first-generation) there was no evidence of overall differences in the improvement in HMB (12 RCTs) or patient satisfaction (11 RCTs).</P>
<P>Surgery was an average of 15 minutes shorter (mean difference (MD) 14.9, 95% CI 10.1 to 19.7, 9 RCTs; low quality evidence), local anaesthesia was more likely to be employed (relative risk (RR) 2.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.4, 6 RCTs; low quality evidence) and equipment failure was more likely (RR 4.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 12.4, 3 RCTs; moderate quality evidence) with second-generation ablation. Women undergoing newer (second-generation) ablative procedures were less likely to have fluid overload, uterine perforation, cervical lacerations and hematometra than women undergoing the more traditional type of ablation and resection techniques (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79, 4 RCTs; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0, 8 RCTs; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.61, 8 RCTs; and RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85, 5 RCTs; all moderate quality evidence, respectively). However, women were more likely to have nausea and vomiting and uterine cramping (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.0, 4 RCTs; and RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4, 2 RCTs; both moderate quality evidence, respectively). The risk of requiring either further surgery of any kind or hysterectomy specifically was reduced with second-generation ablative methods compared to first-generation ablation up to 10 years after surgery (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99, 1 RCT; and RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96, 1 RCT; both moderate quality evidence, respectively) but not at earlier follow up. Additional research is required to confirm this finding.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:21:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Endometrial ablation techniques offer a less invasive surgical alternative to hysterectomy. The rapid development of a number of new methods of endometrial destruction has made systematic comparisons between individual methods and with the 'gold standard' first-generation techniques difficult. Most of the newer techniques are technically easier to perform than traditional hysteroscopy-based methods but technical difficulties with the new equipment need to be addressed. Overall, the existing evidence suggests that success, satisfaction rates and complication profiles of newer techniques of ablation compare favourably with hysteroscopic techniques.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 23:31:55 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), or menorrhagia, is a significant cause of ill health in premenopausal women and can substantially impair their quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). It is clinically defined as blood loss greater than or equal to 80 ml per menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>). With a monthly blood loss of greater than 50 to 60 ml per cycle, most women consuming an average Western diet will develop a negative iron balance (<LINK REF="REF-Rybo-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rybo 1966</LINK>). However, it is the woman's perception of her own menstrual loss that is the key determinant in her referral and, indeed, subsequent treatment. One in 20 women in the UK aged between 30 and 49 years of age consult their general practitioner (GP) each year with HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2000</LINK>), and the condition affects about 22% of otherwise healthy premenopausal women aged more than 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gath-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gath 1987</LINK>). A comparable prevalence rate is likely in other Western countries. In New Zealand, for example, it is estimated that 2.3% of GP consultations for women younger than 50 years are for HMB (<LINK REF="REF-HMB-Guidelines-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMB Guidelines 1998</LINK>). In the majority of cases no pathology (abnormality) is found to explain the HMB (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). The causes of HMB, where there is no endometrial pathology, remain poorly understood and this has been a barrier to the development of new non-surgical therapies.</P>
<P>First-line therapy is usually with drugs prescribed by GPs (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>); in 1993 in the UK, 345,225 women were given 821,700 medical prescriptions, which cost the UK National Health Service over GBP 7 million, to control their HMB (<LINK REF="REF-EHC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EHC 1995</LINK>). However, efficacy is variable and at best medication reduces menstrual blood loss by only 50%. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, on the other hand, is more effective and reduces HMB by as much as 94% at three months (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1998</LINK>). Nevertheless, HMB accounts for 12% of all gynaecology referrals in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Bradlow-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradlow 1992</LINK>). A similar rate of referral (11%) is found in New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-Waimedca-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waimedca 1994</LINK>) and it is likely to be comparable in other Western countries.</P>
<P>Surgical treatment of HMB often follows failed or ineffective medical therapy, although it is also used as a first-line therapy. Hysterectomy has traditionally been regarded as the definitive surgical treatment for HMB but, in spite of a 100% success rate (complete cessation of menstruation) and high levels of satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2010</LINK>), it is a major surgical procedure with significant physical complications and social and economic costs. These include a high rate of major and minor post-operative complications (up to 67%) (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2002</LINK>) and a long recovery time. Almost half of the hysterectomies performed worldwide were carried out for HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Maresh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maresh 2002</LINK>). However, many women prefer less invasive surgical treatment even when they are made aware that the success of the treatment is not always assured (<LINK REF="REF-Nagele-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagele 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 00:02:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometrial destruction techniques, which aim to destroy or remove endometrial tissue, have become increasingly popular, less invasive alternatives in the last two decades and, as a result, the number of hysterectomies in the UK declined by 64% between 1995 and 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2005</LINK>). The first effective ablation of the endometrium under hysteroscopic vision for the treatment of HMB was performed using laser photovapourisation (<LINK REF="REF-Goldrath-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldrath 1981</LINK>). Rollerball ablation (RB) with simple and cheap electrosurgical equipment rather than expensive lasers was performed a few years later (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaincaillie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaincaillie 1989</LINK>). A method to excise rather than ablate the endometrium using an unmodified resectoscope (an instrument used for resection (excision)) was also developed and good results were reported (<LINK REF="REF-DeCherney-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCherney 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeCherney-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeCherney 1987</LINK>). The technique transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) is often used in conjunction with rollerball ablation. These methods of ablation, also termed first-generation methods, were the most commonly used and were widely regarded as the gold standard for endometrial ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2000</LINK>). They all require direct visualisation by a hysteroscope (an instrument for examining the uterine cavity), which may confer the additional advantage of diagnosis of polyps. Endometrial destruction techniques in use in the UK by 1995 included electrocautery, either loop or rollerball (80%), laser (18%) and radiofrequency, a procedure using electromagnetic energy (2%) (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The expectation was that these first-generation ablation methods would become an alternative to hysterectomy but, at least initially, the total number of operations for HMB increased (<LINK REF="REF-Bridgman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridgman 2000</LINK>). More recent figures in the UK suggest that the rate of surgery for menorrhagia (based on data from 2004 to 2006) is 143 procedures per 100,000 premenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Cromwell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cromwell 2009</LINK>), of which approximately 60% are endometrial ablations. However, analyses of recent hospital statistics in the UK suggest that first-generation endometrial ablation has failed to have an impact on hysterectomy numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The drawbacks of these first-generation ablation techniques are the expertise needed and patient morbidity. A prospective national audit of hysteroscopic endometrial ablation and resection (10,686 cases) in England and Wales between 1993 and 1994 assessed the incidence of complications and reported a total complication rate of 4.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Overton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 1997</LINK>). Endometrial ablation by laser and rollerball were significantly safer than endometrial resection; the risk of immediate haemorrhage was three times greater and the risk of uterine perforation was four times greater with resection than with ablation. These complications are thought to be avoidable with good surgical technique and adequate training. However, hysteroscopic endometrial ablation requires an operating room environment, a skilled surgeon and general or regional anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Subsequently, second-generation non-hysteroscopic techniques have been developed, which are considered easier to perform, equally effective and safe (<LINK REF="REF-Madhu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madhu 2009</LINK>). All of these techniques, with the exception of hydrothermal ablation and endometrial laser intrauterine thermal therapy, involve performing surgery without direct visualisation through a hysteroscope. They can potentially be used in outpatient settings and include cryoablation (<LINK REF="REF-Pitroff-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitroff 1993</LINK>), hot saline solution irrigation (<LINK REF="REF-Baggish-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baggish 1995</LINK>), diode laser hyperthermy (heating) (<LINK REF="REF-Donnez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 1996</LINK>), microwave ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1995</LINK>), a heated balloon system (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1994</LINK>) and photodynamic therapy (intrauterine light delivery) (<LINK REF="REF-Fehr-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehr 1995</LINK>). Economic modelling also suggests that second-generation techniques may be more cost effective than first-generation methods (<LINK REF="REF-Garside-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garside 2004</LINK>).</P>

The endometrium has great powers of regeneration and to suppress menstruation successfully it is essential to remove the full thickness of this lining together with the superficial myometrium (wall of the uterus), including the deep basal glands. The latter are believed to be the primary foci for endometrial regrowth. This tissue may be removed under direct hysteroscopic view either by excision with an electrosurgical loop or by ablating the endometrium with some form of thermal energy of sufficient power to produce necrosis (cell death) of the full thickness of the endometrium when applied to its surface.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-30 00:03:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A wide range of techniques are available for ablating and destroying the endometrium to reduce HMB and it is not clear which approaches offer the best option in terms of effectiveness and safety. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of all methods, both by comparing individual techniques pairwise and by making overall comparisons between first and second-generation techniques. Other Cochrane reviews have compared endometrial ablation with hysterectomy for HMB (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2009</LINK>) and endometrial ablation with medical therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The assessment of most of the following outcomes was related to the duration of follow up after the initial surgical procedure. As the aim of endometrial resection and ablation therapies is to offer women a permanent solution to their bleeding problems, long-term follow up of these treatments is needed to enable informed decision making between surgical options. Thus, for the following outcomes, evaluation at different time points is considered important to assess effects over time: six months, 12 months, two years, two to five years and more than five years. Where trials measured outcomes at two different follow-up times within the categories (for example at three and five years), the longer follow-up time only was recorded in the category of two to five years.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:31:20 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Almost all of the outcomes were measured by either dichotomous or continuous data. Two authors extracted data to enable calculation of relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Some outcomes, such as satisfaction with treatment, were measured by ordinal data. These data were dichotomised to represent satisfaction with surgery (highly satisfied and satisfied combined) versus no satisfaction (doubtful or dissatisfied) by collapsing categories. Continuous data were inspected for evidence of skew, where possible, according to guidance in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> by calculating the observed mean minus the lowest (or highest) possible value divided by the standard deviation.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:33:45 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Differences between studies in terms of methodological factors and variations between participants, interventions and outcomes were analysed to determine whether it was appropriate to combine the studies in meta-analysis. If they were sufficiently homogeneous to consider pooling, statistical heterogeneity between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points on the graphs, the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking the results of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests (with P &lt; 0.1 considered evidence of significant heterogeneity) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic is a measure of the consistency between trials in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). As a general rule, I<SUP>2</SUP> values of up to 25% are evidence of low heterogeneity, values from 25% to 50% are considered moderate heterogeneity, and 75% or above is considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>

<P>A comprehensive search was undertaken, along with careful inspection of the search results to identify duplicates, in order to reduce the risk of reporting bias.

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:40:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Where there was no evidence of clinical heterogeneity between the studies and no evidence of major skew in the data, the outcomes were pooled statistically in a meta-analysis using RevMan software.</P>
<P>Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were combined for meta-analysis using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method. For some dichotomous outcomes (for example the proportion of participants requiring further surgery) a higher proportion represented a negative consequence of that treatment, and for other outcomes (for example proportion with improvement in menstrual blood loss) a higher proportion was considered a benefit of treatment. This discrepancy between the categorising of outcomes should be noted when the summary graphs for the meta-analysis are viewed for the assessment of the benefits as opposed to the harms of treatment. Thus, for some of the dichotomous outcomes a treatment benefit is displayed as RRs and CIs to the left of the centre line while for others a treatment benefit is displayed to the right of the centre line. The forest plot for each outcome is labelled clearly for clarification.</P>
<P>Mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs were combined for meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. For all continuous outcomes in this review, a high value represents a negative consequence of treatment, for example duration of surgery, amount of fluid deficit (difference between input and output fluid during surgery), pictorial menstrual blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score. Thus, in the evaluation of the summary graphs means and CIs to the left are considered a benefit of the experimental or comparative treatment.</P>
<P>A fixed-effect model approach was used to calculate summary effect measures. Where there was substantial statistical heterogeneity, results from the fixed-effect model were compared with those from a random-effects model to determine whether results were altered substantially by choice of model. A priori it was expected that two of the outcomes, duration of surgery and proportion having local instead of general anaesthesia, would have heterogeneous results regardless of comparison. For these comparisons a random-effects model was initially used. For all overall comparisons where first-generation methods were compared with second-generation methods, a random-effects model was used because of the expected clinical heterogeneity between trials.</P>
<P>Where there was evidence of skewed data in the measurement of outcomes (for example summary trial results were expressed as median and range), the data for these outcomes were not pooled in the meta-analysis but included in table format.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:41:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned for different times of follow up after surgery, in particular for amenorrhoea rates, satisfaction and requirement for additional surgery. These outcomes were collected at six months, one, two, two to five years, and greater than five years after surgery.</P>
</SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS>
<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:44:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A priori, it was intended that sensitivity analysis would be performed to test the robustness of pooled results in the meta-analysis based on:<BR/>(1) trials with good methodology (evidence of adequate allocation concealment and intention-to-treat analysis) versus all included trials;<BR/>(2) trials with and without power calculations for sample size;<BR/>(3) trials with participants who had confirmed objective heavy menstrual blood loss (more than 80 ml per cycle) versus all included trials;<BR/>(4) trials with participants who had initially failed medical treatment for HMB versus all included trials.</P>

One other study was a 10-year follow up of a study already included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999</LINK>). Four new trials, one of which had two publications, were included in the 2013 update (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penninx-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Penninx 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sambrook-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Sambrook 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thabet-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thabet 2010</LINK>).

Details of the screening and selection process are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design</HEADING>
<P>All of the trials had a parallel group design. Six large trials were multicentre, each with 200 to 300 participants and one smaller multicentre trial had 62 participants. Eighteen of the trials were single-centre studies (one each from Germany, Australia, Egypt and Denmark; two from Turkey; three from the Netherlands and Italy; and six from the UK). Six of the seven multicentre trials were based in the USA, with three having additional centres in Canada, UK or Australia and one multicentre trial had six centres all based in France.</P>
<P>Few of the studies had strict intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses or specified methods to deal with missing data. Twelve trials did not report an ITT analysis. Seven trials claimed that ITT analysis was performed but over time a percentage of participants were lost to follow up so the claim of ITT was misleading. However, ITT analysis was usually performed when assessing outcomes such as complication rates in these studies. Four trials had true ITT analyses and one trial had no reported dropouts. One other trial did not report ITT analysis and replaced dropouts with new cases. Seventeen trials reported either pharmaceutical or medical equipment company partial or complete funding, or had authors with a conflict of interest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 25 included studies contained 4056 premenopausal participants, mostly within the age range 30 to 50 years. In all of the studies women with a complaint of HMB were recruited from secondary or tertiary referral centres or clinics.</P>
<P>Presence of fibroids was an exclusion criterion in 12 studies and all trials required that the uterine cavity be normal in size with no uterine pathology. One trial required women to have myoma-induced menorrhagia (<LINK REF="STD-Soysal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Soysal 2001</LINK>) but excluded women with submucous fibroids greater than 3 cm or less than 50% intramural extension. One other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brun 2006</LINK>) excluded only submucous fibroids and one trial excluded both submucous fibroids and extracavity fibroids &gt; 3 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2011</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Corson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Corson 2000</LINK>), 637 women with self-assessed HMB were screened but, after the application of exclusion criteria, less than half (n = 276) were enrolled and randomised. Almost half of the excluded women had uterine pathology in the form of fibroids or polyps.</P>
<P>Nineteen trials required women to have completed their families and 14 trials included women who previously had not tolerated or had had ineffective medical therapy for their heavy bleeding. Twelve trials objectively confirmed the women's complaint of excessive bleeding by requiring them to record their blood loss. This was prior to surgery and before entry into the trial. Nine trials required women to have pictorial blood loss chart (PBAC) (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>) measurements of 150 or greater prior to entry, two trials required women to have PBAC measurements of 100 or greater prior to entry, one trial required a blood loss score of more than 185 and one trial included women only if their blood loss exceeded 70 ml per cycle (as measured by the alkaline haematin method (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1964</LINK>). All but one trial had comparable demographic characteristics between the comparison groups at baseline; in the Brun trial women undergoing balloon ablation had significantly heavier blood loss than those undergoing TCRE.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies (particularly first-generation techniques) had some kind of pretreatment prior to surgery. In 13 of the trials, participants had pre-operative gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues to prepare and thin the endometrium prior to surgery, although in one of these studies pretreatment was given only to the TCRE group and not to the balloon group. Three months, 14 or seven days of preoperative treatment with progestogens was also used in three trials. One trial required two months of oral contraceptive therapy prior to surgery to ensure that women were scheduled at a similar time in their cycle. One trial required a dilation and curettage procedure prior to ablation surgery. Four other trials used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to prevent uterine cramping. The remaining three trials had no pre-operative therapy.</P>
<P>Five trials compared first-generation ablation methods: two compared laser ablation with TCRE (one argon laser, the other Nd:YAG (neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet)), one compared a vaporising electrode procedure with TCRE, and two compared rollerball with TCRE. All of the TCRE comparison groups also had rollerball ablation to treat the uterine cornua (a horn-like area in the uterus) and fundus (body of the uterus). It was claimed that the vaporising electrode (unlike rollerball) could be used to treat submucous fibroids. Another 14 trials compared second-generation methods with first-generation methods: four compared balloon ablation (three with Thermachoice, one with Cavaterm) with rollerball, one compared the Vesta system with rollerball, two compared microwave ablation with TCRE and rollerball, one compared heated saline (Hydro Thermablator) with rollerball, one compared cryoablation with rollerball, one compared thermal laser with TCRE, two compared electrode ablation with TCRE plus rollerball, one compared balloon (Cavaterm) with laser (Nd:YAG), and two compared balloon (Cavaterm) with TCRE plus rollerball. Five trials compared second-generation techniques, bipolar electrode ablation (Novasure) with either balloon or hydrotherm ablation or microwave compared with balloon ablation. All of the first-generation techniques (laser, rollerball, vaporising electrode and transcervical resection), which use the hysteroscope, were then combined and compared with all the second-generation techniques (balloon, microwave, Vesta system, cryoablation, thermal laser, bipolar electrode ablation and hydrothermal ablation), which are blind techniques. An additional trial compared overcurettage with ablative curettage (<LINK REF="STD-Thabet-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thabet 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Most of the trials assessed amenorrhoea (some included 'light' or 'normal' bleeding), satisfaction rates and frequency of complications. Eighteen trials compared the duration of surgery; 19 trials compared menstrual blood scores on the PBAC chart or success of treatment; 12 assessed the frequency of any additional surgery after treatment; 15 trials compared hysterectomy rates after treatment; 13 trials assessed quality of life measures such as SF-36, improvement in dysmenorrhoea or premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms; and a few trials measured ability to work, difficulty of surgery, rate of acceptability, degree of fluid deficit and duration of hospital stay. The types of anaesthesia used ('local' versus 'general') were compared between first and second-generation techniques.</P>
<P>One trial assessed outcomes only after six months follow up. Eight trials assessed outcomes one year after surgery. Six trials assessed outcomes at both six months and one-year follow up. Three trials assessed outcomes at both one and two-year follow up and the remaining trials had longer-term follow up, at either three, five or 10 years. Two trials did not specify the time at which post-operative outcomes were assessed.</P>

<P>Eight trials did not report any dropouts after treatment (five of these had dropouts ranging from 1% to 4% after randomisation and before treatment). The remaining trials had dropout rates ranging from 3% to 18% after one-year follow up, from 9% to 17% after two-year follow up, from 2% to 16% after five-year follow up, and from 6% to 28% after 10-year follow up. In one of these trials, with a 9% dropout rate (<LINK REF="STD-Corson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corson 2001</LINK>), one arm of the trial (the hydro thermoblator (HTA) group) had a higher dropout rate than the other arm due to equipment failure.

<P>In assessments regarding incomplete outcome data, 16 trials were scored as having adequately addressed their missing data (if any), because there were no reported dropouts, missing data was balanced between groups or there was minimal loss to follow up that was unlikely to affect the calculation of estimates. For five studies it was unclear whether their missing data could cause bias, and for three studies missing data were highly likely to bias the estimates, two because of substantial loss to follow up and the other because there were imbalances in the loss of missing data between groups.

<P>Most of the comparisons had insufficient trials to construct a funnel plot.

For all time points except long-term follow up (10 years) there was no evidence of asymmetry. However, the addition of the single trial assessing satisfaction at 10 years suggested that there was a degree of asymmetry (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<P>Secondary outcomes: in one study, the duration of the procedure was significantly shorter with microwave when compared with TCRE (MD -3.6 min, 95% CI -1.4 to -5.7). In one study, the risk of equipment failure was higher in the microwave group when compared with the TCRE group (RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 13.3). Vomiting and uterine cramping were more likely with microwave treatment than with TCRE (RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 10.0; RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4, respectively). Patients undergoing microwave ablation were more likely to have local anaesthesia than those undergoing TCRE (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.7). At 10-year follow up, the risk of further surgery or hysterectomy was marginally reduced with microwave ablation (any surgery: RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0; hysterectomy: RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.0).</P>

Mean intra-operative blood loss (measured in ml) was significantly less for balloon treatment compared to laser treatment in one small trial (MD -81.8, 95% CI -70.3 to -93.3). Post-operative pain (as measured by a continuous VAS scale) was significantly higher for women in the TCRE group than for women in the balloon group in one small trial (MD 0.6 points, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9), which was confirmed by another trial that could not be included in the forest plot (<LINK REF="STD-Brun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brun 2006</LINK>).

Regarding complications, women undergoing second-generation ablation procedures were less likely to have fluid overload, perforation, cervical lacerations and haematometra as a result of their surgery than women undergoing first-generation ablation (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.8; RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.6; RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9, respectively). They had a significantly greater risk of having nausea and vomiting and uterine cramping (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.0; RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4, respectively). There was no evidence of significant differences for the other secondary outcomes compared, that is inability to work, other complication rates and requirement for any additional surgery or hysterectomy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>1. Specific types of endometrial resection or ablation</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Most of the forest plots comparing specific types of endometrial ablation were comparisons between groups in individual trials or pooled two or three studies at most, and there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity. However, substantial statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) was found for the following forest plots.</P>
<P>Comparison 1.5: duration of operation (laser versus TCRE).</P>
<P>Comparison 7.5: duration of operation (electrode ablation versus TCRE + rollerball).</P>
<P>Comparison 9.8: duration of operation (balloon versus rollerball).</P>
<P>Comparison 9.14: requirement for further surgery (two-year follow up) (balloon versus rollerball).</P>
<P>Comparison 12.3: satisfaction rate (six months follow up) (bipolar radiofrequency ablation versus balloon).</P>
<P>Comparison 12.33: requirement for further surgery (bipolar radiofrequency versus balloon).</P>
<P>Duration of operation is affected by numerous confounding factors, such as expertise of individual surgeons, hospital type and procedures, and differences between groups of women. For the comparison laser versus TCRE, the Bhattacharya study did not include the total time spent in theatre and the McClure study recorded the induction and reversal of anaesthesia in the estimate of operation time, which resulted in much larger estimates. In this latter trial, temporary laser malfunction prolonged two laser cases to 240 minutes. For the comparison electrode ablation versus TCRE + rollerball, differences between studies were likely to be explained by the two different systems used: the Corson study used the Vesta balloon ablation and the Cooper study used Novasure. In the comparison balloon versus rollerball, all three pooled studies used the Thermachoice balloon system. The operation time recorded for the rollerball ablation was similar in the three trials but times differed between studies for balloon ablation. The Meyer study had no pre-operative treatment to thin the endometrium whereas the other two studies had two months of GnRH agonist pretreatment. In the Soysal study, participants had both myomas and heavy menstrual bleeding. Other factors such as cavity length were correlated with operation time and it was not clear whether these were similarly distributed between the participants in the three trials. Another major confounding factor was the ability to use local rather than general anaesthesia, which was more likely in the trials comparing second-generation ablation to first-generation ablation methods.</P>
<P>Satisfaction is also likely to have varied because of different methods of measurement. In the comparison bipolar radiofrequency ablation versus balloon, satisfaction rates at six months in the small Abbott trial may have been related to a technical failure rate of the Novasure procedure, but rates at 12-month follow up were similar and not significantly different.</P>
<P>Significant heterogeneity was also found for the outcome requirement for further surgery in the comparison of balloon with rollerball and bipolar electrode ablation versus balloon. The different results in the two pooled trials for either comparison could not be explained by examination of their characteristics. Neither trial reported a significant difference in the outcome by ablation technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>2. Overall analyses comparing first and second-generation techniques</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Substantial heterogeneity was displayed for many of the outcomes where first-generation procedures were compared with second-generation procedures (comparison 16); in particular, amenorrhoea rate, duration of operation, and proportion having local as opposed to general anaesthesia. The I<SUP>2</SUP> value for the outcome amenorrhoea at one year after surgery was 74%, at two years 50%, and at three years 80%. The rates of amenorrhoea ranged widely in the included trials and no statistical difference was reported between groups. Estimates calculated with the fixed-effect model were compared with estimates calculated with a random-effects model; the estimates did not change markedly but the CIs were wider with the latter approach. There was thus no evidence that amenorrhoea rates varied according to whether first or second-generation techniques were used to ablate the endometrium.</P>
<P>The forest plots of the outcomes, duration of surgery, and local versus general anaesthesia also indicated substantial heterogeneity. Since these two categories were very broad and they included a number of different ablative techniques, heterogeneity was expected and a random-effects model was used to display results. As previously explained, apart from differences between techniques, duration of surgery was likely to be affected by extraneous factors such as skill and expertise of the surgeon, hospital policy and the operating environment. However, each of the included trials reported separately that second-generation techniques took significantly less time to perform than first-generation techniques, regardless of the procedures compared. A random-effects model approach indicated significantly less time required for second-generation procedures; each of the trials individually indicated a statistically significant difference. The other comparison, proportion of women having local as opposed to general anaesthesia, also indicated highly significant heterogeneity. In all trials in the meta-analysis, the proportion of women undergoing ablation with first-generation techniques using local anaesthesia (either TCRE plus rollerball or rollerball alone) ranged from 8% to 23% while the proportion undergoing second-generation ablation using local anaesthesia (Vesta, HTA, Novasure, cryoablation or microwave) ranged from 45% to 86%. All trials separately reported large significant differences between first and second-generation techniques. A random-effects model confirmed these differences in the pooled result.</P>
<P>To sum up, random-effects model analyses confirmed the following.</P>
<P>(1) There was no evidence of a difference in the amenorrhoea when first-generation techniques were compared with second-generation techniques.<BR/>(2) Duration of surgery with second-generation techniques overall was less than with first-generation techniques. Because of heterogeneity, which was probably explainable by other factors such as experience of surgeons, the difference of 15 minutes between procedures represented an average which was not informative and this difference was unlikely to be clinically significant.<BR/>(3) Women undergoing ablation with second-generation techniques were more likely to have local anaesthesia compared to those having ablation with first-generation techniques.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed only on the comparisons where five or more trials were pooled, specifically for the comparison of satisfaction and amenorrhoea rates at one-year follow up between first and second-generation ablation. There were no significant differences reported between randomised groups and the planned sensitivity analyses did not substantially change the results of the included trials, although heterogeneity was reduced.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 22:43:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>A significant number of women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) who seek treatment will not benefit from, or will not wish to continue with, medical treatment and are keen to preserve their uterus. Thus, there appears to be a distinct role for an effective, relatively minor surgical procedure such as endometrial ablation or resection which preserves the uterus yet reduces HMB. This review has assessed a wide range of efficacy, satisfaction and safety outcomes relating to different methods of ablating the endometrium for women who complain of excessive menstrual bleeding.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison of different types of first-generation techniques</HEADING>
<P>The first-generation ablation techniques have been traditionally acknowledged as the 'gold standard' by which other newer procedures are judged. Improvement in menstrual bleeding and satisfaction seems to be similar. The complication profile for the four techniques is slightly different; for example, fluid overload was more likely with laser ablation when compared to TCRE, and also more likely with TCRE when compared to vaporising electrode ablation. However, it is likely that operator safety is a much more important arbiter of patient safety than the instrument itself. Duration of surgery was longer with laser when compared to TCRE and was longer with TCRE when compared to vaporising electrode ablation. Equipment failure was more likely with laser ablation when compared to TCRE and the procedure was more difficult with TCRE when compared to vaporising electrode ablation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison of different types of first-generation with second-generation techniques</HEADING>
<P>With reference to the comparisons of the different types of second-generation techniques with first-generation techniques, thermal laser was more effective than TCRE at reducing blood loss (as measured by amenorrhoea rates) but this did not result in any difference in the satisfaction that the women felt with their surgery. Although rollerball was more likely to result in amenorrhoea when compared to cryoablation, there was also no evidence that women were more satisfied. Similarly, the finding that rollerball was associated with significantly more amenorrhoea when compared to balloon ablation at some time points but not at others is not useful as there was no evidence that this benefit was confirmed by other bleeding outcomes of importance to women, such as PBAC score or scanty menstruation. Patients appeared to be more satisfied with microwave than TCRE at two and five years after surgery, but these findings were not significant at other time points.</P>
<P>With regards to secondary outcomes, duration of surgery was consistently shorter with second-generation ablation and local anaesthesia was more likely to be given. Pain was also more likely with some types of second-generation techniques, such as thermal laser, balloon and hydro thermoablator (HTA), but this outcome was not measured by all trials. The intra-operative and post-operative complication rates are summarised below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison of different types of second-generation techniques</HEADING>
<P>Bipolar radiofrequency ablation was associated with significantly more amenorrhoea than balloon ablation but this was not confirmed by a comparison of PBAC scores or the extent to which women were satisfied with their surgery. Surgery was shorter with bipolar ablation and PMS scores reduced. There was no evidence that bipolar radiofrequency ablation resulted in less re-operation as a result of dissatisfaction with surgery. Bipolar ablation also increased amenorrhoea and satisfaction rates when compared with hydrothermal ablation. The procedure time was shorter with bipolar ablation and women were less likely to require additional surgery at later follow up. Amenorrhoea rates appeared to be increased with microwave when compared with balloon but no differences were found in PBAC scores or satisfaction. Operation time was also reduced with microwave ablation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison of curettage techniques</HEADING>
<P>One small trial, with considerable risk of bias, found advantages for an ablative curettage (devised by the author of the trial) over overcurettage (where the curettage is continued beyond the gritty sensation felt at the basal endometrium) in terms of improved amenorrhoea and normal menstruation rates and reduced failure rate and bleeding complications, but with longer hospital stay. The objective of the study was to find effective techniques for developing countries which may not have the resources and skills to undertake other types of ablation discussed in this review, but the authors acknowledged that curettage may only have a temporary role.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall comparison of first-generation with second-generation techniques</HEADING>
<P>Regarding the overall comparison of second-generation with first-generation techniques, there is no evidence that either broad category is more effective than the other in reducing HMB and there was no evidence that rates of satisfaction differed significantly. Overall, second generation techniques were at least as effective as first-generation methods but were often easier to perform with shorter surgery times and the ability to use local rather than general anaesthesia. Some types of intra-operative and post-operative complications, such as fluid overload, perforation, cervical lacerations and haematometra, were more common with first-generation ablation; and other types of complications, nausea and vomiting and uterine cramping and pain were more common with second-generation techniques. Concerns about these 'blind' methods leading to bowel injuries from undetected uterine perforations did not seem to be confirmed in the published studies. However, there are many anecdotal examples that such events can occur and great care must be taken to minimise the risk of such potentially serious complications. There was no evidence that rates of re-intervention, either repeat ablation or hysterectomy or both, differed between first and second-generation ablation. A recurrent comment about the newer techniques which rely on 'devices' inserted into the uterine cavity to destroy the endometrium was the incidence of equipment failure. This may represent expected 'teething problems' associated with new equipment. However, since the older methods are extremely simple (a loop, laser or diathermy to destroy the endometrium below it) and the newer techniques are potentially quite complex (microwaves, bags of fluid etc) the potential remains for mechanical breakdown to occur. In addition, considerable experience in intrauterine cavity assessment and manipulation is required to safely use any of these devices. There are potential disadvantages to stressing how little operator skill is required for a device, which has the capacity to cause extensive intra-abdominal trauma.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 22:55:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>A perennial and unresolved problem in the assessment of any treatment for HMB is the accuracy of the original diagnosis and the quandary that many women who complain of excessive bleeding will be shown to have menstrual losses (MBL) within normal population limits when blood loss is objectively measured (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1984</LINK>). The 'gold standard' technique for the measurement of MBL involves the collection of all menstrual pads and tampons as well as clots and other blood lost, which is impractical for many women. Also, the assessment of blood loss (via the alkaline haematin method) is a time consuming and laborious task, although objective data are helpful in the research setting. Consequently, a number of more pragmatic alternatives have been suggested to attempt to objectively assess MBL in a normal clinical setting, such as the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC). Unfortunately, none of these alternatives have been shown to reliably correlate with the gold standard. Some authors have accepted that it is the woman's subjective complaint of HMB which is of primary importance in directing intervention in a clinical setting. However, this subjectivity raises problems when used for the comparison of one treatment method with another and in assessing outcome over time. Participants in the trials included in this review all had complaints of HMB but there is likely to be a large variation in the extent of the problem because of the subjective nature of the condition.</P>
<P>To make matters more confusing, evidence from a large cross-sectional survey suggests that whilst many women are referred with menorrhagia, many of these women do not complain of HMB when directly questioned; suggesting a tendency for broad menstrual complaints to be reframed as excessive bleeding at referral and during management (<LINK REF="REF-Warner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 2001</LINK>). As the authors concluded, this is likely to result in women receiving inappropriate care and will also influence the actual and perceived efficacy of treatment modalities for HMB.</P>
<P>The published literature on endometrial destruction techniques for HMB covers a wide range of surgical methods and uses a variety of outcome measures to assess treatment success, making clear comparisons between studies difficult. The participant groups were varied and often potentially important clinical factors, such as the presence of uterine fibroids or a perimenopausal state, were not mentioned in the inclusion or exclusion criteria. This is particularly important with longer follow-up studies. Current clinical approaches to HMB advise that medical therapy should be offered in the first instance, and it would be unusual in normal practice to advise endometrial resection or ablation without trying any medical therapies. Indeed, since medical treatment with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena, Schering) reduces MBL by 94% at three months (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1998</LINK>), and has been shown to be as effective as endometrial ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Istre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Istre 2001</LINK>), it could be argued that endometrial surgery is only appropriate for those who are unsuitable or do not wish to have treatment with the intrauterine system. Fourteen published studies focused on women with failed medical management of HMB and there were insufficient studies within each comparison to determine whether the women in these studies differed systematically in their response to treatment compared with other women. Many researchers are aware of the difficulties in recruitment to randomised clinical trials, and the need to obtain sufficient participants to meet the requirements of power calculations. However, the inclusion of unsuitable or unrepresentative participants in trials does not add to our understanding of the role of new therapies in normal clinical practice.</P>
<P>The published studies show a wide variation in the outcome criteria used in assessing endometrial destruction techniques. Since HMB is the main indication for this procedure, we were surprised to find that only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McClure-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 1992</LINK>) objectively measured MBL. Several studies used the PBAC (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1990</LINK>), which does not correlate well with objective measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2000</LINK>). In addition, the entry criteria for PBAC score varied widely between studies. However, if comparisons are made between studies of changes in PBAC scores following endometrial destruction, few differences were seen between treatment modalities. Some variations were seen in the number of women with amenorrhoea following treatment, but since menstrual destruction methods cannot guarantee amenorrhoea they are generally not suitable for women who feel strongly that they do not want any more bleeding. A number of studies attempted to quantify participant satisfaction with the procedure but used a variety of different measurements to do so, limiting comparisons between studies. Overall, participant satisfaction was high with most procedures and the differences found were unlikely to be clinically significant. Large study numbers would be needed in order to demonstrate a significant difference in satisfaction between different methods of endometrial destruction.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-30 22:56:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base on which this review is based was of variable quality. In particular, few studies were blinded and in most of the comparisons between individual techniques a limited number of studies provided data. Lack of blinding is likely to influence more subjective outcomes, such as satisfaction rates, so findings of these types of outcomes should be viewed with caution.</P>
<P>Substantial heterogeneity was identified in some of the outcomes of the overall comparison between first and second-generation techniques, and the quality of the evidence has been downgraded to reflect the uncertainty around the summary effect estimates.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 23:10:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Surprisingly, although there have been numerous RCTs and observational studies of specific types of endometrial ablation techniques, there have been few systematic reviews identified that have made overall comparisons of the specific endometrial ablation techniques for the reduction of HMB. Numerous narrative reviews have been published, together with comprehensive audits for first-generation techniques. Comparing the first-generation methods of endometrial ablation versus resection, the MISTLETOE study (<LINK REF="REF-Overton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 1997</LINK>) concluded that the methods produced similar outcomes in terms of bleeding and participant satisfaction, but that resection methods have significantly more complications, suggesting that ablation should be used in all women with a non-fibroid uterus.</P>
<P>Systematic reviews, one with individual patient data, have not been able to determine major differences between first and second-generation techniques in terms of effectiveness or satisfaction with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Garside-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garside 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2010</LINK>). However, Middleton has confirmed the results of this review that second-generation techniques are faster, local anaesthesia is more likely to be used, and some complications are less frequent. The suggestion in this review that additional surgery may be less likely with second-generation techniques at longer follow up (10 years) is based on only one trial and needs confirmation from further research.</P>
<P>Of the-second generation techniques, the most studied have been Novasure, balloon and microwave ablation (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2011</LINK>). A recent network meta-analysis reported that bipolar radiofrequency and microwave ablation resulted in higher rates of amenorrhoea than thermal balloon ablation at 12 months after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2012</LINK>), but there was no evidence of a convincing difference between the three techniques in satisfaction rates or the number of women still experiencing heavy bleeding. Other outcomes were not assessed. However, the lack of a consistent measure of effectiveness has made it difficult to adequately compare techniques and reach conclusions on the technique of choice. Other authors have suggested that there might be commercial resistance to comparing devices, given the likely effect on the market share for the inferior treatment (<LINK REF="REF-McGurgan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGurgan 2007</LINK>). It has also been suggested that a potential limitation of second-generation devices is the restrictions on the size and configuration of the endometrial cavity that may prevent general application of any device to the HMB population (<LINK REF="REF-Munroe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munroe 2006</LINK>). Many of the included studies that evaluated these devices in this review had fairly strict inclusion criteria, limiting the applicability of results to women with large or distorted uteri. Thus, not all women with HMB may be candidates for second-generation ablation and it has been suggested that gynaecologists should retain their skills in hysteroscopic surgery for certain types of intrauterine pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>An additional issue is the role of patient preferences in decision making on treatments for HBS. A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>) suggested that reaching a decision on a 'one size fits all' approach may be elusive and that eliciting patient preferences, based on the evidence, is required to reach the decision on the 'best' approach.</P>

<P>Endometrial destruction by first or second-generation techniques should be considered for all women with normal uteri who wish to reduce their heavy menstrual bleeding and wish to retain their uterus.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-30 23:19:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Future studies should aim to include women in whom medical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding has been ineffective. Future studies should also pay more attention to reducing the risk of bias, as many studies had substantial shortcomings.</P>
<P>Menstrual blood loss should be objectively or semi-objectively measured in all comparative studies (by the alkaline haematin method or the PBAC), although assessment of the women in the clinical setting is nearly always based on more subjective criteria, such as perception of heavy bleeding.</P>
<P>Amongst first-generation techniques for endometrial destruction, there are good data to support the use of endometrial ablation rather than resection (<LINK REF="REF-Overton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 1997</LINK>). There is a need to systematically compare first-generation ablation methods with second-generation techniques using standardised criteria of participant satisfaction, quality of life and objectively measured menstrual blood loss in order to establish which of the newer methods has an established role, and when they should be the instruments of choice. This may require referral to another unit where such techniques are available. There was insufficient evidence in this review to determine the superiority of one type of second-generation technique over another.</P>
<P>Equipment reliability for the second-generation techniques needs to be established.</P>
