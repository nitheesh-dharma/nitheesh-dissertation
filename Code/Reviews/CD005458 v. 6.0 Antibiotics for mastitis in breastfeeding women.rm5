<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 11:07:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Inflammation of the breast, or mastitis, can be infective or non-infective. Infective mastitis is one of the most common infections experienced by breastfeeding women. The condition (infective or not) varies in severity, ranging from mild symptoms with some local inflammation, redness, warmth and tenderness in the affected breast through to more serious symptoms including fever, abscess and septicaemia, which may require hospitalisation. Recovery can take time, and there may be substantial discomfort for the affected mother and her baby. Mastitis usually occurs during the first three months after birth and results in the mother being confined to bed for one day, followed by restricted activity. The condition is associated with decreased milk secretion, decreased productivity, and in difficulties caring for the baby. This burden to mothers, along with the cost of care, the potential negative impact on continuation of breastfeeding, and the danger of serious complications such as septicaemia, makes mastitis a serious condition which warrants early diagnosis and effective therapy. The review included two studies and approximately 125 women. One study compared two different antibiotics, and there were no differences between the two antibiotics for symptom relief. A second study comparing no treatment, breast emptying, and antibiotic therapy, with breast emptying suggested more rapid symptom relief with antibiotics. There is very little evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, and more research is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:26:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:25:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast, usually associated with lactation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Hence, it is also known as lactational mastitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1989</LINK>) or puerperal mastitis (<LINK REF="REF-Editorial-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial 1976</LINK>). An estimated 2% to 33% of breastfeeding women develop lactational mastitis (<LINK REF="REF-Buescher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buescher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fetherston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fetherston 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foxman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonsson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonsson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinlay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinlay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vogel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogel 1999</LINK>). Population-based studies in Australia reported that 15% to 20% of women during the first six months after delivery were affected, while a cohort study of American women reported that 10% of women experienced mastitis during the three months following the birth. Mastitis may recur: a New Zealand study of 350 lactating mothers showed a 8.5% recurrence rate.</P>
<P>The primary cause of mastitis is milk stasis (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1989</LINK>), which may or may not be associated with infection. Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast, limited feeding (in cases where the mother is introducing formula feeding), or restricted feeding, all of which may result in milk stasis and mastitis. In infective mastitis, <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and <I>Staphylococcus albus</I> are the commonest organisms found on laboratory investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Novy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1990</LINK>). <I>Escherichia coli</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1999</LINK>) and streptococci are found less frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Novy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novy 1984</LINK>). Delayed, inappropriate or inadequate treatment may result in unnecessary discontinuation of breastfeeding, breast tissue damage, recurrence, and substantial cost (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical symptoms of mastitis include unilateral breast pain, redness (erythema) and swelling, and may be associated with flu-like symptoms (fever, chills and aches). Unilateral erythema, oedema and tenderness of the affected breast are usually present on examination. In contrast, engorgement of the breast is normally bilateral and uncomfortable rather than acutely painful; and in cases of breast abscess, a fluctuating, tender and hard breast mass is found with overlying erythema (<LINK REF="REF-Bedinghaus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedinghaus 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hager-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogle-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogle 1988</LINK>). Milk leucocyte count, bacteria colony count and culture may be useful investigations to differentiate infective from non-infective mastitis (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:25:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The principles of treating mastitis include supportive counselling and supportive therapy (bed rest, increased fluids), effective milk removal (by encouraging the continuation of breastfeeding and assessing how the baby is feeding; helping the mother to adjust positioning and attachment if necessary; and milk expression), symptomatic treatment (pain medication, use of anti-inflammatory agents), antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1999</LINK>), probiotic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Jimenez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez 2008</LINK>) and other agents such as nisin (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2008</LINK>). Although efficient milk removal is the mainstay of treatment, antibiotics are usually prescribed to cover possible bacterial infections. These include penicillin, dicloxacillin and cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Hager-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2002</LINK>) for staphylococcal and streptococcal infections; for gram-negative organisms, cephalexin or amoxicillin may be appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis varies worldwide, and researchers have been unable to reach a consensus on whether to prescribe antibiotics for women with lactational mastitis. <LINK REF="REF-Osterman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osterman 2000</LINK> underscored the benefit of prescribing both antibiotic therapy and supportive treatment in the presence of infective agents. They prescribed antibiotics after bacterial cultivation for 61% of participants in a cohort of lactational women with mastitis. The authors argued that since breast milk potentially contained pathogenic bacteria, the majority of the mothers should be treated with antibiotics. However, <LINK REF="REF-Kvist-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvist 2004</LINK> only treated 9% of breast inflammation with antibiotics. A study in Western Australia treated 85% of participants with inflammatory breast symptoms with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Kvist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvist 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Matheson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matheson 1988</LINK> concluded that phenoxymethylpenicillin failed to stop abscess formation in 20% of mothers suffering from mastitis and that the majority of them recovered without antibiotics. <LINK REF="REF-Amir-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amir 2004a</LINK> stated that low incidence of abscess formation (0.1% in their study) raised the question as to whether antibiotic therapy is appropriate for all mothers with symptoms of breast inflammation. They reported that only 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 6.7) of women who took antibiotics for mastitis developed abscesses.</P>
<P>There has also been argument about the type of antibiotic chosen for breastfeeding women suffering from mastitis. Practice relating to the choice of antibiotic therapy has varied widely. An audit of the management of mastitis in the emergency department of Melbourne Hospital, Australia, showed that the majority of women with mastitis received flucloxacillin (91 women out of 111), a beta-lactamase stable penicillin closely related to cloxacillin, as recommended by Australian Antibiotic Guideline (1996) (<LINK REF="STD-Amir-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Amir 2004b</LINK>). Amir reported that, due to adverse hepatic events, dicloxacillin should replace flucloxacillin (<LINK REF="STD-Amir-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Amir 2004b</LINK>). A prospective study (n = 840) conducted in the US between 1994 and1998 reported that 86% of women with mastitis received antibiotics, most of whom were on cephalexin (46%). The rest received amoxicillin (7%), ampicillin (7%) and amdinocillin clavulanate (7%). No cultures were performed because of cost restrictions (<LINK REF="REF-Foxman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxman 2002</LINK>). Another recent publication (<LINK REF="REF-Eglash-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eglash 2006</LINK>) reported a chart review of 64 women with lactational mastitis presenting to a lactation specialist between 1997 and 2002; these women received routine antibiotic therapy at the time inclusive of cephalexin, dicloxacillin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and clindamycin. The choice of antibiotics was based on the mother's and her baby's records of allergies and intolerances; mother's preference regarding the frequency of antibiotic administration; bacterial culture and sensitivities, and medication cost.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:26:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little consensus on who should be prescribed antibiotics, the most appropriate antibiotic to use, the best time to begin treatment and how long the treatment should continue. Most studies have focused on the effectiveness of emptying the breast and the timing of treatment, rather than on the type of antibiotics used (<LINK REF="REF-Crepinsek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepinsek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Devereux-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereux 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinlay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinlay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK>). Use of laboratory investigation before antibiotic therapy is not consistent, and type of antibiotic chosen depends on physician choice rather than scientific proof. There is also little information on the cost-effectiveness of different therapies.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK> included 13 participants in the amoxicillin group and 12 in the cephradine group. <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> included 55 'cases' (individual breasts) in each of three arms (antibiotic plus breast emptying, breast emptying alone and no treatment). We have assumed that the number of women included in the analysis was approximately 100, although the actual number of women suffering from infective mastitis is not provided in the paper. (The paper described findings for women with both infective and non-infective mastitis (n = 213). The total number of affected breasts was 339, so overall, approximately 60% of the women had both breasts affected. The number of infected breasts was 165 (55 in each of three treatment groups); assuming that the same proportions of women with infective versus non-infective mastitis had both breasts affected, this would mean that approximately 100 women had infective mastitis and are included in the analysis in this review.)</P>
<P>Participants included in these trials were lactating mothers with symptoms of mastitis such as persistent tenderness of breast, swelling, redness, decreased milk secretion, fever or breast discomfort. Leucocyte count was also used in <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> as an inclusion criterion for treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK> did not include any placebo or non-treatment control group. The treatment regimens compared in this trial were oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every eight hours for seven days versus oral cephradine, 500 mg every eight hours for seven days. Participants in both groups were advised to continue breastfeeding and to apply warm, moist compresses every four to six hours (<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> included two control groups, one where women received no treatment and a second where there was breast emptying. The treatment group in this study received the following antibiotics: penicillin 500,000 IU three per day for six days, oral ampicillin 500 mg, four per day for six days and erythromycin 500 mg twice per day for six days (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK>).</P>

<P>As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar and not of sufficient quality, we did not do a meta-analysis and have therefore presented data, and discussed results, separately for the two included studies. In future updates of the review, as new studies emerge, it may be possible to add further comparisons and, where appropriate, combine findings in a meta-analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Proportion of participants with resolution of symptoms or improvement</HEADING>
<P>Symptom improvement reported by women (outcome number 1) was not measured in either of the included studies. Both studies included findings relating to the second primary outcome (symptom improvement assessed by clinicians). However, comparison between the two studies was impossible since one was comparing antibiotic therapy with breast emptying versus breast emptying or no treatment, while the other was comparing two different types of antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>One study assessed symptom improvement assessed by clinicians after seven days, but did not provide information on the continuation of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK>). In this study all women prescribed cephradine and most of those prescribed amoxicillin had symptom improvement after seven days; there were no statistically significant differences between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> assessed continuation of breastfeeding after 14 days. In this study, analysis was carried out on cases (breasts) rather than a participant basis. Each case was a breast with mastitis symptoms. Cases were divided into three groups depending on laboratory investigations; cases with milk stasis only (n = 126), cases with non-infective inflammation (n = 48), and cases with infective mastitis (n = 165). Only cases in the third group (those with infective disease) were considered relevant to this review. This infective mastitis group was divided into three subgroups: cases receiving no treatment (n = 55), breast emptying only with no antibiotic therapy (n = 55), or receiving antibiotic therapy plus emptying the breast (n = 55). We carried out two separate comparisons: first women receiving no treatment versus women receiving antibiotics with breast emptying; and second, breast emptying alone versus antibiotics with breast emptying.</P>
<P>For cases with infective mastitis, the outcome was good in 15% of cases if there was no treatment and in most cases (96%) for women undergoing antibiotic therapy with breast emptying (RR 6.63, 95% CI 3.48 to 12.60) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). (The outcome was considered either as good if inflammatory symptoms disappeared followed by normal lactation two weeks after the initial diagnosis; or bad when symptoms persisted for more than 14 days. Impaired milk secretion, recurrence of infection, or progression of the symptoms to sepsis or breast abscesses were also considered as bad outcomes.) When antibiotic therapy with breast emptying was compared with breast emptying alone, again those receiving antibiotic therapy were more likely to have a good outcome (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women were also likely to recover more quickly if they received antibiotics with a mean duration of symptoms of 6.7 days in the no-treatment group, 4.2 days in the breast emptying group and 2.1 days in the antibiotic therapy with breast emptying group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> study, the unit of analyses was breasts rather than individual women, so for women who contributed two infected breasts to the analysis, the response to treatment in each breast was unlikely to have been independent. We therefore conducted a series of sensitivity analyses where we made several different assumptions. For example, we assumed that 28 women (in both groups) each had two infected breasts; this effectively reduced the sample size to half the original size. The results of the sensitivity analyses (based on differing assumptions) made little difference to the results, although the smaller sample sizes (when women rather than single breasts were the unit of analysis) resulted in wider confidence intervals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> did not report whether or not there were any adverse events or drug reactions following antibiotic therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK>, however, mentioned that there were no adverse side effects to the antibiotics administered. The women were asked about compliance with dosing at the return visit, and all indicated that they had taken their medication as prescribed with no complications. Neonatal complications, hospitalisation and costs were not reported in either study.</P>

<P>Recurrence within 30 days was reported for one woman (7.6%) in the amoxicillin arm and two women (16.6%) in the cephradine arm (<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> had an overall recurrence of 12 cases in the infective mastitis arm.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:32:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The main finding of the review is that there is insufficient evidence available to confidently evaluate the effect of antibiotic therapy on mastitis. Controlled scientific studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking in this field. Observational studies suggest that the type of antibiotic prescribed depends on physician preference, without any scientific proof. Various classes of antibiotics are prescribed without laboratory investigation. These include penicillins and cephalosporins (<LINK REF="STD-Amir-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Amir 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1990</LINK>). Antibiotic resistance may arise as a result of tendency to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is possible that lower-cost, narrower-spectrum antibiotics based on bacterial culture might be as effective as the use of higher cost, broad-spectrum antibiotics. The findings of this review were not able to shed light on these questions.</P>
<P>Antibiotic therapy can be directed by leucocyte count and the susceptibility tests of isolated bacteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK>). This approach was used by <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK>, who examined the effect of antibiotic therapy versus supportive therapy. They categorised 213 women with mastitis into three groups: milk stasis (with bacteria &lt; 103/mL; leucocytes &lt; 106/mL), non-infective inflammation (bacteria &lt; 103/mL; leucocytes &gt; 106/mL), and infective mastitis (bacteria &gt; 103/mL; leucocytes &gt; 106/mL). For those in the latter group, antibiotic therapy was based on sensitivity cultivation. Women who received antibiotic therapy achieved the fastest symptom clearance of 2.1 days, as opposed to the other two groups (6.7 days if under no treatment and 4.2 days if under supportive therapy). Moreover, 11% of cases with no intervention developed an abscess, while none in the group treated with antibiotic therapy suffered from any abscess, indicating a better outcome if antibiotics were used in cases with mastitis. However, there were limitations in the <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> study. Although it was a RCT, the study was conducted 25 years ago and it lacked several features of a well-designed trial: the process of concealment was not mentioned and there was no placebo used.<BR/>
<BR/>Current practice for treating mastitis varies widely. There is a lack of properly-designed RCTs to evaluate the best antibiotic therapy for treating mastitis. <LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK> is the only RCT suitable for review that compared two types of antibiotics (amoxicillin, cephradine) in a small group of 25 women with mastitis. The author-calculated sample size for each arm of this study was 72; however, the number of included women was 13 for the amoxicillin group and 12 in the cephradine group. Therefore, this study was underpowered and was unable to detect differences in the predetermined treatment outcome. The authors were unable to run a Chi² test as the number of women in cross-tabulated cells was less than five. Therefore, the Fisher Exact test was used and there was no significant difference between the two arms in terms of treatment failure.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hager 1996</LINK> suggested that both oral antibiotics appeared equally effective in the treatment of sporadic acute puerperal mastitis. Moreover, there is a lack of information on the possible side effects of antibiotics on neonates when they are used for treatment of mastitis.</P>
<P>Our updated literature search was unfruitful in finding any studies that looked at some of the pre-determined outcomes of this review, such as hospitalisation and costs. We found two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jimenez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jimenez 2008</LINK>) focusing on other methods of treatment using probiotics and other agents such as nisin. These studies introduced lactobacillus strains and bacteriocin nisin as the potential and effective alternative therapy for mastitis. However, since the focus of our study is antibiotic therapy we did not include them in our review. It is recommended that a new title would specifically look into the effectiveness of these alternative therapies. The need for comprehensive RCTs on mastitis and antibiotic therapy still remains.</P>

<P>There is little evidence from the RCTs currently available to evaluate the effect of antibiotic therapy on mastitis. The included trials failed to meet some of the criteria for methodological quality, and the outcome measures used were too varied for comparisons to be made between studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-28 11:28:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an urgent need for high-quality, large randomised placebo-controlled trials. Future research should be designed so as to have adequate power (sample size), adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and clear description of follow-up, to allow appropriate comparisons between various antibiotic therapies or placebo groups, or both. Primary outcomes of this review, including symptom improvement reported by women or found by clinical assessment, the effect of continued breastfeeding versus no breastfeeding and the result of treating the infective mastitis based on laboratory investigation, should be further investigated. Secondary outcomes such as neonatal complications, hospitalisation, cost of treatment and adverse reactions following antibiotic therapy, should also be considered. Each and every one of these variables are important in terms of maternal and child health. We recommend a comprehensive RCT to investigate all of the above mentioned variables.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. Where we could not make a clear decision on the basis of the title or abstract, we considered the study to be relevant. We retrieved the full text of relevant studies. If the retrieved articles were not written in English, we obtained a translation. Two review authors independently examined the retrieved articles to assess whether they satisfied the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreement by consensus with a third review author.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently double entered data. A third review author checked to ensure concordance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of included studies using the criteria in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We assessed each study for quality in terms of sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other&#8217; potential sources of bias. We reported methods used for the generation of the randomisation sequence for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>We considered the sequence generation to be adequate if the following or similar methods were used: repeated coin tossing, throwing dice or dealing previously shuffled cards or computer generation of random numbers. We considered any other non-random type of sequence generation inadequate. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for concealment to each trial, using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation;</LI>
<LI>inadequate concealment of allocation, such as random number tables, sealed envelopes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Where the method of allocation was unclear, we had planned to contact study authors to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (loss of participants, e.g. withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow-up using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>less than 5% of participants excluded;</LI>
<LI>5% to 10% of participants excluded;</LI>
<LI>more than 10% and up to and including 20% of participants excluded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to exclude studies from analysis, because of the risk of bias, if:</P>
<P>(A) more than 20% of participants were lost to follow-up;<BR/>(B) more than 20% of participants were not analysed according to randomisation groups and where it was not possible to restore participants to the correct group;<BR/>(C) where there was a large difference (more than 10%) in withdrawal of participants between groups.</P>
<P>We also considered selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of bias such as time lag, location bias and language bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. Two review authors extracted the data independently onto standardised, structured tables. We resolved differences in opinion as above. We performed data entry using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). If data were unclear, we tried to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We used the Cochrane Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) to analyse the data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we have reported results as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we planned to calculate the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We planned to use the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence interval to combine trials measuring the same outcome, but using different methods. We recorded evidence of skewness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We used a fixed-effect model for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. In the case of heterogeneity, we planned to use a random-effects model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We would have applied tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² test. If we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (I²<SUP> </SUP>exceeding 50%), we would have explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and by performing sensitivity analysis. We would have used a random-effects meta-analysis as an overall summary if this had been considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We would have carried out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality. We would have excluded studies of poor quality (with poor allocation concealment or levels of attrition above 20%) in the analysis in order to assess for any substantive difference to the overall results.</P>
<P>The analysed units in <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1984</LINK> study were breasts, rather than women (213 women or 339 breasts). The sample would have included women with either both or only one breast affected, and where both breasts were infected the treatment effect in each breast would not be independent. Therefore, we carried out an exploratory sensitivity analysis to look at various different scenarios, for example, where we assumed that all women had two affected breasts, or where half had only one breast affected.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We had planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>. We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>dosage of antibiotics used (e.g. antibiotic A dosage 250 mg versus antibiotic A dosage 400 mg);</LI>
<LI>drug reaction: (maternal drug reaction, infant/child drug reaction).</LI>
</OL>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>

<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results.

<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>

<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Their<I> </I>sample sizes or standard errors will be adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Cross-over trials will be excluded from this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition will be noted. The impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses will be carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if I² is greater than 50% and either T² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identify substantial heterogeneity (above 50%), we will explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by Egger 1997, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by Harbord 2006. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of T² and I².</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>dosage of antibiotics used (e.g. antibiotic A dosage 250 mg versus antibiotic A dosage 400 mg);</LI>
<LI>drug reaction: (maternal drug reaction, infant/child drug reaction).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Subgroup analyses will be restricted to the review's primary outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess differences between subgroups by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We plan to carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any difference to the overall result.</P>
