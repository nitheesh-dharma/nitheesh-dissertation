<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system which affects young and middle-aged adults. MS causes disruption of the ability of nerves to conduct electrical impulses, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue and loss of control over the limbs. Occupational therapy (OT) is used to try to help people with MS participate in the physical and social activities of their daily lives. The review found that there is currently no reliable evidence that OT improves outcomes for people with MS, although there was some suggestion that fatigue might be improved. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-06-25 11:46:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are referred to occupational therapy with complaints about fatigue, limb weakness, alteration of upper extremity fine motor coordination, loss of sensation and spasticity that causes limitations in performance of activities of daily living and social participation. The primary purpose of occupational therapy is to enable individuals to participate in self-care, work and leisure activities that they want or need to perform.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether occupational therapy interventions in MS patients improve outcome on functional ability, social participation and/or health related quality of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-06-25 11:46:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group trials register (January 2003), the Cochane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2002, MEDLINE (January 2003), EMBASE (December 2002), CINAHL (December 2002), AMED (December 2002), SciSearch (December 2002) and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Controlled (randomized and non-randomized) and other than controlled studies addressing occupational therapy for MS patients were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A list proposed by Van Tulder 1997 was used to assess the methodological quality. For outcome measures, we calculated standardized mean differences. We analysed the results using a best-evidence synthesis based on type of design, methodological quality and the significant findings of outcome and/or process measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One randomized clinical trial was identified and two other included studies were a controlled clinical trial and a study with a pre-post test design. The three studies involved 271 people in total. Two studies evaluated an energy-conservation course for groups of patients and one study evaluated a counseling intervention. The results of the energy conservation studies could be biased because of the designs used, the poor methodological quality and the small number of included patients. The high quality RCT on counseling reported non-significant results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>On basis of this review no conclusions can be stated whether or not occupational therapy improves outcomes in MS patients.<BR/>The lack of (randomized controlled) efficacy studies in most intervention categories of occupational therapy demonstrates an urgent need for future research in occupational therapy for multiple sclerosis. Initially, a survey of occupational therapy practice for MS patients, including the characteristics and needs of these patients, is necessary to develop a research agenda for efficacy studies.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-18 12:33:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that represents a significant cause of disability. The disease is characterised by multiple lesions occurring in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord resulting in functional loss, including weakness, fatigue, spasticity and impairments of cognition, vision, speech, swallowing, cerebellar, bowel and bladder function (<LINK REF="REF-Sliwa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sliwa 1998</LINK>). In the Netherlands, approximately 80 out of 100,000 persons have MS (<LINK REF="REF-Moorer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorer 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Therapy for MS can be divided into two categories: disease modifying therapies and symptomatic or supportive therapies to optimize functional capabilities. Occupational therapy (OT) is an example of the latter category. The primary purpose of OT is to enable individuals to participate in self-care, work and leisure activities that they want or need to perform (<LINK REF="REF-Tipping-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tipping 1994</LINK>). MS patients are referred to occupational therapy with complaints of fatigue, limb weakness, alteration of upper extremity fine motor coordination, loss of sensation and spasticity that causes limitations in performance of activities of daily living. Occupational therapists instruct these patients on energy conservation, time management, efficient body mechanics and task performance, with or without assistive devices. In the Netherlands, progressive neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, MS and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are listed as the third most referred patient category for occupational therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Driessen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driessen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>One non-systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Ko-Ko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko Ko 1999</LINK>) incorporated occupational therapy in the discussion of the multi-disciplinary rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis. However, this review mentioned only one study in which occupational therapy and physical therapy were the interventions under research. One meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>) on physical, psychological and functional interventions incorporated occupational therapy related treatments such as multi-disciplinary interventions, physical therapy and social work. To our knowledge no systematic reviews of the efficacy of occupational therapy for multiple sclerosis have ever been published.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether occupational therapy interventions in MS patients improve outcome on functional ability, social participation and health related quality of life.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies with one of the following designs have been entered in the review.<BR/>(1) Randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT): An experiment in which investigators randomly allocate eligible people into treatment and control groups. Cross-over trials were considered as RCTs according to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). <BR/>(2) Controlled clinical trial (CCT): an experiment in which eligible people are, in a non-randomized way, allocated to the treatment and the control groups.<BR/>(3) Other than controlled designs (OD): patient series and pre-post studies. Such ODs can only contribute in a limited way to the best evidence synthesis.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies with patients who fulfil a clinical diagnosis (as described by the authors of the studies) of multiple sclerosis have been included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In MS, occupational therapy (OT) can include a variety of interventions. OT interventions were either regarded as "comprehensive OT" (when all six intervention categories were part of the evaluated OT treatment) or were classified into six specific intervention categories: (1) training of motor functions; (2) training of skills; (3) instruction in energy conservation skills; (4) counselling; (5) advice or instruction regarding the use of assistive devices and (6) provision of splints. <BR/>All studies were evaluated by a group of four experienced occupational therapists and reviewer CHME (see: Methods of the review). If the aforementioned OT interventions were specified in a study, then it was eligible for inclusion in this review. </P>

</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-25 12:13:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We performed selection for inclusion in the review, assessment of the methodological quality and data extraction in three separate steps. Three reviewers (EMJS, MC, CHME) took part in these procedures. Prior to all steps, two reviewers tested assessment procedures in a sample of two articles. A standard form for each step was made.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Selection</B>
<BR/>As we used a broad search strategy, we expected to find a large number of ineligible articles. The procedure for inclusion of the studies has been based on the recommendations by Van Tulder et. al. (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>): Two reviewers (EMJS and CHME) independently performed the first selection, based on titles and abstracts. This first selection could result in probable inclusion of the study, exclusion of the study, or could be indecisive. Two reviewers (EMJS and CHME) also independently performed the second step for inclusion (definite include or exclude), using full reports and considering the criteria stated above. We resolved disagreements regarding inclusion status through discussion. If we did not reach consensus, a third reviewer (MC) decided. Finally, a group of four occupational therapists assessed the criteria for 'type of intervention' and, if appropriate classified the type of intervention into one of the six different interventions or combinations of interventions. We reached consensus through discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>The variety in study designs included in this systematic review necessitated the use of different quality assessment tools. The methodological quality of RCTs and CCTs has been rated by a list recommended by Van Tulder et. al. (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>). The list, containing specified criteria proposed by Moher (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1996</LINK>) and Verhagen et al (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>), consists of 11 criteria for internal validity, six descriptive criteria and two statistical criteria (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). One modification was made in the specification of the criterion 'eligibility' in which the 'condition of interest' (the impairment or disability that indicated referral to occupational therapy) was added as an eligibility criterion, as proposed by Wells (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>). All criteria were scored as yes, no, or unclear. Equal weight has been applied to all items. Studies were considered to be of 'high quality' if at least six criteria for internal validity, three descriptive criteria and one statistical criterion were scored positively.</P>
<P>We rated the methodological quality of ODs using an adapted version of the Van Tulder list ( <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 1997</LINK>). We considered some items (concerning randomization, similarity of patient groups, blinding of care-provider, blinding of patient) inapplicable to ODs and removed them from the list. We reformulated some items to make the item applicable to one patient group (for instance: "were co-interventions avoided or comparable?' was reformulated into "were co-interventions avoided?") or to make the item applicable for the design of the study (for instance: "was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention" was reformulated into: "was the care-provider not involved in the outcome assessment?") The final list of criteria used in ODs consists of seven criteria for internal validity, four descriptive criteria and two statistical criteria (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). We scored all criteria as yes, no, or unclear. Equal weight has been applied to all items. We considered studies to be of 'sufficient quality' if at least four out of seven criteria for internal validity, two descriptive criteria and one statistical criterion were scored positively. Of course, the distinction between ODs with a sufficient or non-sufficient quality is a relative one: the internal validity of ODs is on average substantially weaker than the internal validity of RCTs/CCTs.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (EMJS, MC) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials. We resolved disagreements by discussion. If no consensus was met a third reviewer (CHME) decided.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>EMJS systematically extracted the following information:<BR/>(1) Study characteristics: number of participating patients, specified criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of experimental and control interventions, co-interventions, features of interventions (duration, frequency, setting) and number of drop-outs.<BR/>(2) Patient characteristics: sex, age, disease duration and disease severity.<BR/>(3) Outcome and process measures assessed immediately after finishing the intervention, within six months follow up and after six or more months follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>For continuous variables, we computed standardized mean differences wherever possible.<BR/>For dichotomous variables, we computed odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Analysis of the results</B>
<BR/>We performed separate analyses for each intervention category. The primary analysis focused on comparisons of an occupational therapy intervention with a 'no treatment' control group. However, if studies compared the effect of more than two intervention groups, two reviewers (EMJS, CHME) decided by consensus, how these comparisons had to be classified. In particular, if two interventions were compared, the predominant contrast needed to be the occupational therapy treatment provided.<BR/>We expected to find a lot of diversity among studies with regard to patients (severity of the disease), interventions (duration, frequency and setting) and outcome measures (diversity, presentation of the results) to make quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) appropriate. Instead, we performed a best evidence synthesis by attributing various levels of evidence to the efficacy of occupational therapy, taking into account the design of the studies, the methodological quality and the outcome of the original studies. The best-evidence synthesis (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) is based upon the one proposed by Van Tulder et. al. (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2002</LINK>) and we adapted this for the purpose of this review.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses by attributing different levels of methodological quality to the studies:<BR/>(1) excluding low quality studies; and<BR/>(2) considering studies to be of "high quality" if four or more criteria of internal validity were met.</P>

<P>
<B>Description of studies</B>
<BR/>The search strategy resulted in a list of 420 citations. After inclusion on title, abstract and full article, three (<LINK REF="STD-Mathiowetz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mathiowetz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hara-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hara 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanage-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanage 2003</LINK>) out of six identified OT studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. The Mathiowetz study was an uncontrolled repeated time series, O' Hara reported on a randomized clinical trial whereas the Vanage study used a controlled clinical trial design. See "Table: Characteristics of Included Studies".</P>
<P>
<B>Education in energy conservation</B>
<BR/>Two studies evaluated the impact of an energy conservation course for groups of multiple sclerosis patients on fatigue. The energy conservation course used in the CCT (Vanage 2003) was adapted from the energy conservation course used in the OD (<LINK REF="STD-Mathiowetz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mathiowetz 2001</LINK>). The CCT had one hour sessions in an eight weeks course with three to eight participants while the OD evaluated sessions of two hours for six weeks with eight to ten participants. Additionally, the Mathiowetz study evaluated also the outcome measures: functional ability, social participation and self-efficacy. Assessments in the OD (<LINK REF="STD-Mathiowetz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mathiowetz 2001</LINK>) were performed six weeks before the start of the course, at the start of the course, at the end of the course and at six weeks follow-up. The Vanage study measured before and at the end of the course and at eight weeks follow-up. The comparison of treatment was made with a socializing group.</P>

<BR/>One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Hara-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Hara 2002</LINK>) evaluated a program in which two discussion sessions about self-care strategies were applied to MS patients living in the community.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although two of the three studies included in this review reported efficacy of occupational therapy, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of occupational therapy for multiple sclerosis patients. Both studies were non-RCTs and had a small number of included patients. These two identified studies evaluated a specific OT intervention, namely an energy conservation course for groups. Only one study on Counselling was found and it showed no evidence for the efficacy of this intervention. We did not identify any other studies for the other interventions.</P>
<P>Our results do not correspond with the findings of a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>) on the efficacy of OT-related treatments for MS patients. Their review on physical, psychological and functional interventions incorporated 23 studies on OT related treatments such as multi-disciplinary interventions, physical therapy and social work. In our review we only included OT interventions. Furthermore, we excluded studies because of the use of a single-case design or because of the inclusion of patients with other diseases than MS in the original study. These differences in inclusion criteria might clarify the large dissimilarity in the amount of included studies in both reviews. Other differences were the methodological choices made. Baker et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>) presented an overall medium effect size (r = 0.52). On the basis of the diversity between patients, interventions and outcome measures, we chose to use a qualitative best-evidence synthesis instead of performing a quantitative meta-analysis and to analyse results per outcome dimension. In our opinion the latter is a better way of dealing with large diversity and hetereogeneity. We question whether the efficacy of occupational therapy can be based on non-OT studies and therefore, in our opinion, the results of our review provide a better estimate of the efficacy of OT.</P>
<P>The lack of occupational therapy efficacy studies in MS patients should be of great concern. It is well known that MS is a progressive disease with a high impact on functional ability and participation. In multi-disciplinary rehabilitation the role of OT is well recognized (<LINK REF="REF-Feigenson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigenson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Di-Fabio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Fabio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1997</LINK>). OT aims at the consolidation of functional abilities and participation despite the expected decline in physical functions and abilities which is often seen in progressive diseases. </P>
<P>If OT has an important role in the efficacy of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, why are there so few OT studies? One possible reason is that is may be difficult to clearly distinguish two different OT treatment methods in a RCT. Furthermore, a comparison between a treated and a non-treated control group seems to be even more difficult because it is often considered unethical to exclude people with a progressive disease from treatment. In addition, most of the MS patients are treated in a multi-disciplinary context which makes it difficult to control for co-interventions. These arguments might provide some of the answers to the question why the efficacy of OT for MS patients is so rarely studied. </P>
<P>Although clinical guidelines are formulated (<LINK REF="REF-Richer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richer 1999</LINK>) for the OT treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases including MS, the treatment recommended is not evidence based. Furthermore, little is known about the characteristics and needs of MS patients referred to OT, goals set in the OT-treatment, specific interventions applied to reach those goals, and outcomes important to patients and occupational therapists. Initially, a survey of occupational therapy practice for multiple sclerosis patients including the characteristics and needs of these patients is necessary to develop a research agenda for efficacy studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On basis of this review, no conclusions can be stated whether or not occupational therapy improves outcomes in multiple sclerosis patients. Although two studies presented outcomes favouring occupational therapy, these results are possibly biassed due to methodological flaws.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-24 11:35:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>The lack of randomized controlled efficacy studies in most intervention categories of occupational therapy shows an urgent need for future research in occupational therapy for multiple sclerosis. A survey addressing the questions: which MS patients are treated in OT; which of their problems should be addressed within OT treatment; what goals are relevant; what are the interventions applied by occupational therapist to reach these goals; which outcomes are important to both MS patients and occupational therapists; will give more insight into OT practice for multiple sclerosis. On the basis of this information, specific efficacy questions can be formulated and examined with the best possible methodological design. A high methodological quality and sufficient statistical power are two important issues in planning future research.<BR/>

<TITLE>Occupational therapy for multiple sclerosis</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Young, active MS patients strikingly often complain about fears to perform strenous tasks which their professional life requires. <BR/>Lifting, in fact any kind of abrupt general effort may thus result in a sudden aggravation of the incapacitations which they are particularly prone to. <BR/>During the last fifty years, his peculiarity of MS seems to have fallen more and more into oblivion.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Dr. Schelling stresses an important issue regarding occupational performance in MS patients. Although occupational therapy's focus on activities is much broader than work related activities it is known that strenuous tasks may aggravate MS symptoms. Research in occupational therapy for MS is very rare and focuses until now primarily on fatigue management. Which means that patients are guided to find a balance between physical exertion and relaxation. We discussed in our review that little is known about the characteristics and needs of MS clients referred to occupational therapy. In our view, it is very important to focus on client centred outcomes in future research , including finding ways to perform strenuous tasks if necessary.</P>
