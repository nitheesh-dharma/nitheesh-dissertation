<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-04 08:32:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Varicocele is a dilatation (enlargement) of the veins along the spermatic cord (the cord suspending the testis) in the scrotum. Dilatation occurs when valves within the veins along the spermatic cord fail and allow retrograde blood flow, causing a backup of blood. The mechanisms by which varicocele might affect fertility have not yet been explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which surgical treatment of the varicocele might restore fertility. This review analysed 10 studies (894 participants) and found evidence (combined odds ratio was 1.47 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.05) to suggest an increase in pregnancy rates after varicocele treatment compared to no treatment in subfertile couples, in whom, apart from poor sperm quality, varicocele in the man was the only abnormal finding. This means that 17 men would need to be treated to achieve one additional pregnancy. However, findings were inconclusive as the quality of the available evidence was very low and more research is needed with live birth or pregnancy rate as the primary outcome.</P>

<P>A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. Although the concept that a varicocele causes male subfertility has been around for more than 50 years now, the mechanisms by which a varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neither is there sufficient evidence to explain the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would restore fertility.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-07 08:15:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (12 September 2003 to January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (January 1985 to January 2012), PsycINFO (to Week 1 2012) and reference lists of articles. In addition, we handsearched specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2012. We also checked cross-references, references from review articles and contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-08-22 10:22:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed. If they reported pregnancy rates or live birth rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) compared to untreated or placebo groups. Two authors independently screened potentially relevant trials. Any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus (none occurred for this review).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-04 08:25:34 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. For one study we had only data from a published abstract. All ten studies only included men from couples with subfertility problems; one excluded men with sperm counts less than 5 million per mL and one excluded men with sperm counts less than 2 million per mL, with or without progressive motility of less than 10%. Two trials involving clinical varicoceles included some men with normal semen analysis. Three studies specifically addressed only men with subclinical varicoceles. Studies were excluded from meta-analysis if they made comparisons other than those specified above.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 14:34:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis included 894 men. No studies reported live birth. The combined fixed-effect odds ratio (OR) of the 10 studies for the outcome of pregnancy was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.05, very low quality evidence), favouring the intervention. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 17, suggesting benefit of varicocele treatment over expectant management for pregnancy rate in subfertile couples in whom varicocele in the man was the only abnormal finding. Omission of the studies including men with normal semen analysis and subclinical varicocele, some of which had semen analysis improvement as the primary outcome rather than live birth or pregnancy rate, was the subject of a planned subgroup analysis. The outcome of the subgroup analysis (five studies) also favoured treatment, with a combined OR 2.39 (95% CI 1.56 to 3.66). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 7. The evidence was suggestive rather than conclusive, as the main analysis was subject to fairly high statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 67%) and findings were no longer significant when a random-effects model was used or when analysis was restricted to higher quality studies.</P>

<P>There is evidence suggesting that treatment of a varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility may improve a couple's chance of pregnancy.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-06 09:04:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. There are different grades of varicocele as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO): WHO 0: only demonstrable by technical diagnostic methods; WHO I: only palpable/visible during Valsalva manoeuvre; WHO II: palpable when in upright position at room temperature; WHO III: visible when in upright position at room temperature. It has long been uncertain whether it is true or not that a varicocele is "nature's attempt to heal a diseased testis rather than afflict an otherwise healthy one" (<LINK REF="STD-Nieschlag-1995_x002f_1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nieschlag 1995/1998</LINK>). Although the concept that a varicocele causes male subfertility has been around for more than fifty years now, the mechanisms by which varicoceles would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neither is there sufficient evidence to explain the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy might restore fertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relationship exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus (a network of many small veins found in the human male spermatic cord) and impairment of fertility.</P>
<P>In a multi-centre study on the investigation and diagnosis of the subfertile couple, the incidence of varicocele in the male partners of subfertile couples was 11.7%. On the other hand, in men with abnormal semen analysis (SA) parameters the incidence of varicocele was 25.4% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Thus, varicocele is the most frequent single physical abnormality found in subfertile men and occlusion of the left spermatic vein is accepted by many physicians as the treatment of choice for this condition (<LINK REF="STD-Nieschlag-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nieschlag 1993</LINK>). Estimates of the incidence of varicocele in men from the general population, however, arrive at a similar figure (15%) (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2008</LINK>). Yet varicocele for many years has been associated with abnormalities in semen parameters and implicated as a cause of male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Dubin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubin 1977</LINK>). Impaired blood drainage from the testis leading to increased scrotal temperature, hypoxia, increased testicular pressure and reflux of adrenal metabolites and hormones, with deleterious effects on spermatogenesis have been proposed as the etiology (<LINK REF="REF-Dubin-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubin 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homonnai-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homonnai 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pryor-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pryor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segenreich-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segenreich 1986</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-04 08:41:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Varicocelectomy is the surgical correction of a varicocele. There are various methods, the traditional method of treatment being surgical ligation of the internal spermatic vein. Several surgical techniques have been employed but retroperitoneal high ligation (as initially described by Ivanissevitch and modified by Palomo) and trans inguinal ligation (as described by Bernardi) are the most frequently performed. More recently, selective embolization of the internal spermatic vein with sclerosing solutions (sclerosation), tissue adhesives, or detachable balloons or coils have been used as alternatives. Laparoscopic ligation has also been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Cayan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cayan 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Many men with varicocele have normal fertility and investigators have doubted the therapeutic value of treatment of varicocele (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriquez-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriquez 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 1985</LINK>). A review of 50 publications of observational studies including a total of 5471 couples with uncompromised female fertility and a varicocele in the man showed widely varying pregnancy rates of 0% to 50% after treatment, with a weighted mean of 36% (<LINK REF="REF-Mordel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mordel 1990</LINK>). This is similar to the 33% spontaneous pregnancy rate in a 1992 review of 20 studies of 2026 couples with completely unexplained subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1992</LINK>). Conclusions regarding the true effect of varicocelectomy on pregnancy rate can only be derived from prospective studies with an unbiased control group: randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>

<P>Two review authors (AK and NL) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed and pilot-tested by the authors. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third author (JE). Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>): method of randomisation; number of men randomised, excluded and analysed; whether they were single centre or multi-centre studies; employed parallel or cross-over design; nature of interventions; the participants (age range, eligibility criteria). We listed details of duration of subfertility, method of investigation of the varicocele, sperm analysis and previous treatment(s) whenever given; blinding of treatment (virtually impossible in studies involving surgery); the use of sequential analysis or factorial design; the performance of a power calculation; duration of follow-up; whether pregnancy was an outcome measure and, if so, how it was diagnosed; how pregnancy results were presented (particularly whether cumulative conception curves with the use of life table analysis were employed); and the source of any funding. We recorded the grades of varicoceles according to WHO criteria (WHO 0: only demonstrable by technical diagnostic methods; WHO I: only palpable/visible during Valsalva manoeuvre; WHO II: palpable when in upright position at room temperature; WHO III: visible when in upright position at room temperature). For females we recorded age and factors of female infertility (when applicable). Where studies had multiple publications, the main trial report was used as the reference and additional details were derived from secondary papers. We corresponded with study investigators for further data on methods and/or results, as required.</P>

<P>Ten studies included 449 men with varicocele in the intervention groups and 445 men with varicocele in the control groups. All men were from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-05 07:21:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of the original review (2009) failed to offer evidence that treatment of a varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility improves the chance of spontaneous pregnancy. The findings of this updated review, supplemented by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Meguid-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Meguid 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dohle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dohle 2010</LINK>) suggest that pregnancy rates may improve after treatment of varicocele. The combined OR of the 10 studies was 1.47 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.05, P &lt; 0.03), favouring treatment over no treatment. We excluded studies which involved men with normal semen analysis (and azoospermia) and subclinical varicocele, some of which had semen analysis improvement as the primary outcome rather than pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="STD-Breznik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Breznik 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grasso-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grasso 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Unal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>), and performed a subgroup analysis. So the subgroup consisted of five trials, which were restricted to men with clinical varicocele, an abnormal semen analysis and pregnancy rate as the primary outcome. This subgroup analysis also favoured treatment over no treatment, with a combined OR of 2.39 (95% CI 1.56 to 3.66).</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was fairly high for the primary analysis (67%). Moreover, findings were sensitive to the choice of statistical model and a random-effects model found no significant difference between the groups. Restriction to higher quality studies also found no significant difference between the groups, though this analysis included only 79 men and results bordered on statistical significance.</P>
<P>The present review suggests a benefit from treatment of varicocele for subclinical and clinical varicocele in subfertile men with normal and abnormal semen analysis and with otherwise unexplained subfertility. However, our findings are not conclusive as the overall quality of the evidence was very low.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-28 14:28:20 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies reported live birth, but the included studies did report pregnancy rates. There was discussion in the review team about the applicability of studies which included men with normal semen analysis and subclinical varicocele and a primary outcome other than live birth or pregnancy. For this reason we performed a subgroup analysis of studies which were restricted to men with clinical varicoceles, an abnormal semen analysis (azoospermia excluded) and pregnancy rate as the primary outcome. This subgroup analysis agreed with the findings of the main analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-05 07:23:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies and the small numbers should be taken into account, and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Moreover, our findings were sensitive to choice of statistical model, and were only of borderline significance when analysis was restricted to higher quality studies. This suggests that the benefit found for treatment of varicocele should be interpreted very cautiously. A funnel plot for the outcome of pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) was not suggestive of publication bias.</P>

<P>The decision to include studies which included normozoospermic men from infertile couples (<LINK REF="STD-Breznik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Breznik 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Unal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>) was disputable, but was based on their apparently representing a category of patients for whom varicocelectomy is deemed appropriate. Given their allocation by randomisation these men were evenly distributed between the experimental group and the controls. Also, the decision to include studies which accepted men with subclinical varicocele (<LINK REF="STD-Breznik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Breznik 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grasso-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grasso 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Unal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>) is disputable. The Americal Urology Association (AUA) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) state that normospermia and subclinical varicocele are no indication for surgical treatment. A literature search regarding the relationship between grade of varicocele and the response to varicocelectomy showed different outcomes, ranging from no improvement of semen analysis after treatment of subclinical varicocele to significant improvement. However, live birth or pregnancy rate were not outcomes in these studies. This was a reason to perform a subgroup analysis with the exclusion of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Breznik-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Breznik 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grasso-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Grasso 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Unal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>).</P>

The OR comparing counselling only or clomiphene citrate to no treatment for pregnancy rate was 1.27 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.32, P = 0.43, 445 men, 77 pregnancies), which was not significant.</P>

<P>This review covers a long period of time. Especially in the early years, study methodology was far from perfect. Addition of new, better studies to the review has allowed for performing a subgroup analysis of the higher quality studies. Although the findings of our previous meta-analysis were consistent with those of non-Cochrane reviews at the time (<LINK REF="REF-Cocuzza-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocuzza 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marmar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmar 2007</LINK>), the present updated review suggests that there might be some value in varicocelectomy in selected patients.</P>

<P>Surgical or radiological treatment of varicocele in subfertile men with clinical varicocele and abnormal semen analysis may be of benefit, but the evidence is not conclusive. The value of surgical or radiological treatment in subfertile men with subclinical varicocele and normal semen analysis is disputable, as the number needed to treat to benefit was 17.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-07 07:35:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ideal trial design would be to compare, in a randomised fashion, a sham operation with the actual procedure; any other design is potentially biased by the placebo effect of having had the operation performed; and surgery is a strong placebo indeed. However, for such a trial design it would be difficult to obtain ethical committee approval since it would put the control group at risk of surgical and anaesthetic complications without any possibility of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Hargreave-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hargreave 1997</LINK>). Since all studies included in the present review essentially considered invasive treatment, in none had the investigator, patient, or assessor been blinded to the procedure performed. However, the outcome measures of this review, live birth and pregnancy rate, were unambiguous. Therefore, apart from the placebo effect, no other negative factors of the lack of blinding were presumed to affect the conclusions drawn.</P>
<P>The studies included in the present review of varicocele treatment are heterogeneous. This indicates a need for a large, properly conducted RCT of varicocele treatment in men with varicocele and sperm defects, from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility. The authors realise, however, that it will become increasingly difficult to conduct such a study, since the introduction of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the fertility clinic will make many men reluctant to take the risk of being allocated to the no-treatment arm of such a study, when at the same time a robust treatment of proven effectiveness is readily available in the form of IVF/ICSI. The issue will be further compounded by the fact that many couples tend to delay their first pregnancy nowadays, and are likely to feel that they have not much time left to spend on expectant management once they have decided, in their mid- to late thirties, to seek professional help for their fertility problem.</P>
