<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Constraint-induced movement therapy in the treatment of the upper limb in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This therapy involves constraining the non-affected arm to encourage performance of therapeutic tasks with the affected arm, which children normally tend to disregard. Two clinical trials showed positive trends in support of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and Forced Use, whilst another demonstrated a positive treatment effect favouring modified CIMT as a treatment for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. This evidence is based on one small randomised controlled trial with methodological limitations, one trial with ambiguous methodology and reporting and one controlled clinical trial. There is a need for additional high quality research to adequately support the use of this therapy. <B>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy learn strategies to manage daily tasks (for example play) using one hand and often the affected limb is disregarded or not used. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is emerging as a treatment approach for use with children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. It aims to increase spontaneous use of the affected upper limb and thereby limit the effects of developmental disregard. CIMT is based on two fundamental principles: constraint of the non-affected limb and massed practice of therapeutic tasks with the affected limb.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of CIMT, modified CIMT or Forced Use in the treatment of the affected upper limb in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to August Week 4 2006), CINAHL (1982 to July Week 3 2006), EMBASE (1980 to August 2006), PsychInfo (1985 to August Week 4 2006) and reference lists of all relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing CIMT, modified CIMT and Forced Use with traditional services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy or no treatment were selected.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors extracted the data independently using standardised forms. Each trial was assessed for internal validity with differences in ratings resolved by discussion. Data were extracted and entered into Review Manager 4.2 where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three studies met the inclusion criteria. The results of one RCT showed a trend for positive treatment effect favouring CIMT using the Dissociated Movement subscale of the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST). Other outcome measures, that were without reported psychometric properties, showed significant treatment effects. A CCT demonstrated a significant treatment effect favouring modified CIMT at two and six months using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA). Another trial with inaccurate reporting and ambiguous methodology, showed a significant treatment effect at 6 weeks on the self care component of the WeeFIM using a Forced Use protocol. All other measures showed no significant treatment effect. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review found a significant treatment effect using modified CIMT in a single trial. A positive trend favouring CIMT and Forced Use was also demonstrated. Given the limited evidence, the use of CIMT, modified CIMT and Forced Use should be considered experimental in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Further research using adequately powered RCTs, rigorous methodology and valid and reliable outcome measures is essential to provide higher level support of the effectiveness of CIMT for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>
<I>Cerebral palsy</I>
</B> <BR/>Cerebral Palsy (CP) describes "a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain" (<LINK REF="REF-Bax-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bax 2005</LINK>, p.571). It is characterised by sensorimotor dysfunction as manifested by atypical muscle tone, posture and movement. cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of approximately 2 per 1000 children born in Australia and most developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Flett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2000</LINK>). It affects more than 20,000 people Australia wide (<LINK REF="REF-www.betterhealth.vic" TYPE="REFERENCE">www.betterhealth.vic</LINK>). </P>
<P>Hemiplegia, characterised by a clinical pattern of unilateral motor impairment, is a common type of cerebral palsy accounting for 36% of all cerebral palsy in Victoria, Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2005</LINK>), 15.3% in Ontario, Canada, 40% in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2005</LINK>) and 31.2% in North England, United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Jessen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jessen 1999</LINK>). Severity of impairment varies widely, depending on the site and severity of brain damage (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maegaki-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maegaki 1997</LINK>). Reduced upper limb function may result from sensory abnormalities, weak grasp, loss of fine-sequenced movements of the fingers, loss of speed of movement, loss of fine motor skills, associated and mirror movements, retention of grasp reflex and spasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 2000</LINK>). From an early age, children with a unilateral impairment will tend to use their non-affected hand as the dominant hand, even when the actual functional loss is mild (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 1998</LINK>). Over time these children learn to disregard the affected arm which has the potential to lead to further impairment including increased muscle tone, poor motor control, decreased active and passive range of motion of the joints of the limb, generalised weakness, and a delay in skeletal maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scrutton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scrutton 2004</LINK>)<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Learned non-use and developmental disregard</I>
</B>
<I> <BR/>
</I>Adults with hemiparesis following stroke are believed to exhibit a phenomenon termed learned non-use (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK>). In the acute phase of a neurological insult following stroke early attempts to use the affected limb are effortful, inefficient and result in clumsy movement. Future attempts to use the affected limb are therefore avoided or suppressed while compensation with the unaffected limb is quickly learnt in order to independently manage daily tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK>). Taub (1980) defines this behavioural phenomenon as a learned non-use and believes it has a significant effect on the recovery of the affected limb, as potential functional use is masked. </P>
<P>Similarly, as children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy grow and develop they learn strategies and techniques to manage daily tasks (for example play) with one hand. Performance of tasks is discovered to be more efficient and effective using the non-affected hand, even if there is only mild impairment in the affected limb (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhtz_x002d_Buschbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhtz-Buschbeck 2000</LINK>). Recently, <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> introduced the term developmental disregard to describe a child with hemiplegia who may disregard, or learn not to use, the affected limb during the development of motor function. Despite the similar behavioural mechanisms of reinforcement of the unaffected hand and suppression of the affected hand, as identified in adults, <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2003</LINK> suggested that the learned non-use may be a different phenomenon in children who sustain an early brain lesion. Unlike an adult who has had a neurological insult later in life, a child with hemiplegia has not had the experience of normal motor function of the limb. There is not the potential to unmask motor function that is inhibited. Therapy must, therefore, create the opportunity, experience and environment in which a child can learn how to use their affected limb. This experience must reverse the behavioural aspect of suppression of use of the affected limb and reward use of that limb in even the simplest tasks, such as stabilisation of an object. CIMT is proposed as a method of achieving this (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Another important factor which may contribute to a developmental disregard of the affected upper limb in a child with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is the presence of mirror movements. These occur when repetitive voluntary movements of one hand are accompanied by involuntary mirrored movements of the other hand (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhtz_x002d_Buschbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhtz-Buschbeck 2000</LINK>). Considered to be normal early in motor development, mirror movements are observed to be more pronounced or are prolonged with childhood hemiplegia. The results of a study by <LINK REF="REF-Kuhtz_x002d_Buschbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhtz-Buschbeck 2000</LINK> showed that mirror activity was associated with poor bimanual coordination. This is because the two hands perform asymmetrical actions in most activities of daily living and in these situations mirror movements disturb co-ordinated performance. In children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, mirror activity was stronger in the non-affected hand than in the affected hand. The authors suggested that mirror movements may, in fact, cause a decrease in the use of the affected hand as they interfere with the skilled performance of the non-affected hand (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhtz_x002d_Buschbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhtz-Buschbeck 2000</LINK>). Their findings may support a unilateral approach to treatment in some children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. The implication for therapists is the requirement of careful consideration of the effect of strong mirror movements when encouraging a bimanual approach to intervention. </P>

<I>Treatment of hemiplegia<BR/>
</I>
</B>Conventional management of the upper limb of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy has involved the use of modalities such as splinting, casting, passive stretching, the facilitation of posture and movement (for example through neuro-developmental therapy), spasticity medication such as Baclofen, surgery, and more recently the use of Botulinum toxin-A (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2004</LINK>). In general, the primary aim of these therapies is to reduce muscle tone and spasticity, increase range of movement of the affected limb, and improve functional use of the limb. In 2001, <LINK REF="REF-Boyd-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 2001</LINK> conducted a comprehensive systematic review on several upper limb management approaches and CIMT was presented as an emerging therapy in the management of the upper limb in cerebral palsy. There is growing literature on this approach that warrants critical review. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT)</I>
</B> <BR/>CIMT has its foundation in behavioural research with non-human primates, conducted by Taub and co-workers (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK>). The researchers surgically abolished somatic sensation in a single forelimb in a monkey using dorsal rhizotomy (de-afferentation). Following surgery, the forelimb was not freely used by the monkeys in usual activities despite intact motor function roots. After restricting the movement of the intact forelimb continuously for a period of days however, the monkey could be induced to use the de-afferented extremity (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK> reported that although the movements were not normal they were extensive and effective and the authors considered the intervention to have provided a substantial rehabilitation of movement. </P>
<P>Two different but linked mechanisms are considered to be responsible for increased use of the more affected extremities as a result of CIMT: overcoming learned non-use and inducing use-dependent cortical re-organisation (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>). CIMT is based on two fundamental principles: the constraint of the non-affected limb and massed practice of activities with the affected limb. CIMT attempts to change the contingencies of behavioural reinforcement so that the learned non-use of the more affected upper limb is "counter-conditioned or lifted" (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>, p20). The consequent increase in the use of the more affected limb is argued to "induce expansion of the contralateral cortical area controlling movement of the more affected limb" and to recruit new ipsilateral areas (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>, p20). It is proposed that this may serve as the neural basis for the permanent increase in use of the affected limb following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>CIMT has been used in several studies with adult populations including those with stroke, traumatic brain injury and focal hand dystonia (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1999</LINK>). Taub suggests that CIMT for the upper limb involves inducing use of the more-affected limb for a target of 90 percent of waking hours by using a sling or half glove (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-_x0026_-Wolf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub &amp; Wolf 1997</LINK>) over a period of two to three weeks. During this time, concentrated, repetitive training of the more affected limb is provided daily for six hours using a shaping technique (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1999</LINK>). The shaping procedure involved '(a) providing explicit verbal feedback and verbal reward for small improvements in task performance; (b) selecting tasks that were tailored to address the motor deficits of the individual patient; (c) helping the patient to carry out parts of a movement sequence, if they were incapable of completing the movement on their own at first; and (d) systematically increasing the difficulty of the task performed' (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>, p21). </P>
<P>Despite the conceptual difference in behavioural adaptation (learned non-use vs. developmental disregard) as a result of an acquired condition (for example stroke) compared with a congenital condition (for example cerebral palsy), the core components of a CIMT program including restraint and massed practice, aim to reverse the behavioural suppression of movement in the affected upper limb. As a result,<B> </B>CIMT is emerging as a treatment approach for children with cerebral palsy and it raises significant clinical practice issues for occupational therapists. Traditionally, therapists working with children with hemiplegia have attempted to encourage normal movement of the affected hand by utilising bimanual tasks or voluntary repetitive practice of unilateral activities. In order to engage in these activities, often verbal and physical prompting is required to encourage repeated practice with the affected hand. Such persistent prompting can become frustrating for a child when movements are clumsy and effortful and often do not result in a successfully completed task, as perceived by the child. Negative behaviours can occur in response to this persistent prompting. Forced Use of the affected limb through a CIMT program however, removes the need for persistent prompting and may be a more effective way of improving outcomes. It may, on the other hand, lead to the opposite effect if a child demonstrates adverse behavioural responses to the restraint.</P>

<P>Interventions that included the use of CIMT, mCIMT or Forced Use in the treatment of the affected upper limb compared with traditional treatments (that is occupational therapy or physiotherapy) or no treatment. </P>
<P>For the purpose of this review the following definitions, as described by <LINK REF="REF-Taub-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 2002</LINK>, were used. </P>
<P>Constraint-induced movement therapy: restraint of the unaffected upper limb is applied and more than three hours of therapy per day (massed practice) is provided for at least two consecutive weeks. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT):<B> </B>restraint of the unaffected upper limb is applied and less than three hours per day of therapy is provided to the affected limb. </P>
<P>Forced Use: restraint of the unaffected upper limb is applied but no additional treatment of the affected upper limb is provided. </P>
<P>Due to the vastly different intensity of treatment provided within each type of therapy these terms are not interchangeable and studies were therefore reviewed separately. Studies that used any treatment approach that provided massed practice of movement to the affected upper limb when the restraint device was worn (that is behavioural shaping or motor learning principles) were included and categorised according to the above definitions.<BR/>

<BR/>Quality assessment</I>
</B> <BR/>Study quality was assessed using an adaptation of the method outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>. The following characteristics were assessed. </P>
<P>
<I>Adequacy of the randomisation process: <BR/>
</I>A - adequate sequence generation is reported using random number tables, computer random number generator, coin tossing, or shuffling; <BR/>B - did not specify one of the adequate reported methods in (A) but mentioned randomisation method; <BR/>C - other methods of allocation that appear to be unbiased. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Adequacy of the allocation concealment process: <BR/>
</I>A - adequate measures to conceal allocations such as central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained convincing elements of concealment; <BR/>B - unclearly concealed trials in which the author either did not report an allocation concealment approach, or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A); <BR/>C - inadequately concealed trials in which method of allocation was not concealed such as alternation methods or use of case record numbers. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Potential for selection bias after allocation: <BR/>
</I>A - trials where an intention-to-treat analysis was possible and few losses to follow up were noted; <BR/>B - trials which reported exclusions (as listed in A but exclusions were less than 10%); <BR/>C - no reporting on exclusions, or exclusions greater than 10% or wide differences in exclusions between groups. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Level of masking (treatment provider, patient, outcome assessor): <BR/>
</I>A - double or triple blind; <BR/>B - single blind; <BR/>C - non-blind. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Data analysis</I>
</B>
<B> <BR/>
</B>We had planned to use a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies and to use a random-effects model when such heterogeneity was likely (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>); however, we decided that a combined analysis using pooled data was not appropriate due to the small number of studies located, inconsistency in outcome measures used and the variations in intensity of treatment. <BR/>
<BR/>We followed the Cochrane preferred method for handling continuous variables as outlined in the Cochrane Handook<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>) and as advised by the Movement Disorders Review Group. This approach assesses mean change scores (and standard deviation of the change) from baseline to time points following intervention, thus allowing for differences in baseline performance. In order to obtain the standard deviation of the mean difference authors were contacted where necessary<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>). <B> </B>This method of analysis was used only for primary outcome measures within studies. For all other outcomes, calculations were based on values at specific time points.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of 214 references were identified. Independent scrutiny of the titles and abstracts identified 26 potentially relevant articles. Of the 26, 23 were excluded because they were a mixture of abstracts, case reports, case series, narrative reviews or included children with diagnoses other than cerebral palsy. The remaining three trials met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of this review. These studies are described in full in the Characteristics of included studies table.</P>
<P>The small RCT conducted by <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> enrolled 18 children (13 males, 5 females, aged 7 to 96 months) who were randomised to CIMT (bivalved cast for 21 days and 6 hours/day shaping treatment) or traditional services. Outcome measures were reported to be obtained at baseline, three weeks, six weeks, three months and six months, however all outcomes were not fully reported, including data for the traditional services group at 3 and 6 month follow-up. Outcomes included the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test - Dissociated Movement subscale, Pediatric Motor Activity Log, Toddler Arm Use Test and Emerging Behaviours Scale. The trial was reported in an unpublished dissertation (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>) from the University of Alabama and later published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 2004</LINK>). Although the trial was reported as an RCT with a cross over design (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>), data from only one group (CIMT) were reported in the cross over period and the publication (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 2004</LINK>) omitted both the cross-over component of the trial and the QUEST data. As a result, the trial was reviewed as an RCT without the cross over component and results from both the unpublished dissertation and the publication are discussed in this review. <BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> compared a mCIMT protocol (mitt for 2 hours/day for 2 months and 2 hours/day motor control treatment) with traditional services in 41 children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, aged 18 months to 4 years of age (20 males, 21 females). Children were recruited by an open invitation to parents. The single outcome measure used was the Assisting Hand Assessment at baseline, two and six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> compared a Forced Use protocol (application of short arm cast for 6 weeks with no additional therapy) with traditional services in 31 children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (15 males, 16 females). Outcome measures obtained at baseline and six weeks, included the box and blocks test, Erhardt Developmental Prehension Assessment and the WeeFIM.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>A quality assessment instrument based on the <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK> criteria was used to evaluate the methodological quality of each trial. An additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) contains the consensus of the review authors. <BR/>

<I>
<BR/>Randomisation and adequacy of allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>The method of allocation concealment adopted by <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> involved folding a piece of paper, taped closed and drawn from a jar set up before the beginning of the participant enrolment. The method used to generate the random allocation sequence generation was not described. As <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> was a CCT, no randomisation procedures were undertaken. Children in the CIMT group were recruited by an open invitation to parents of children fulfilling the inclusion criteria who lived in the region of metropolitan Stockholm. The control group was mainly recruited from regional paediatric programmes. </P>
<P>Despite the abstract reporting <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> as a prospective case series, the main body of text reported random assignment of children to treatment or control group. This contradiction provides ambiguity regarding the true methodology of the trial. Due to the random assignment of children and a two group design, the study will be viewed as an RCT for the purposes of this review. A description of the randomisation and allocation concealment process or level of masking is not provided suggesting poor methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Participant baseline characteristics</I>
</B> <BR/>All trials enrolled children, aged between seven months and eight years, with cerebral palsy resulting in hemiplegia or substantially greater deficit in movement of one upper extremity in comparison to the other. <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> reported that no statistically significant differences were found at baseline between CIMT (n=9) and control groups (n=9) in terms of age, gender, severity of hemiparesis, prior treatment history or baseline scores on outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> matched children for age and degree of hand function (using the Assisting Hand Assessment) and there was no reported statistically significant difference between the groups (CIMT n=21, control n=20) on these variables. <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences were found at baseline between the Forced Use (n=18) and control groups (n=13) in terms of age, gender and baseline scores on outcome measures.</P>
<P>Despite random allocation (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>) and matching of children (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>), the clinical heterogeneity of children with cerebral palsy and small sample sizes means it is unlikely that baseline differences were likely to achieve statistical significance. There was however, the possibility of clinically important differences. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> the CIMT group demonstrated a mean pre-treatment QUEST score of 23.27(SD 18.02) while the control group had a mean score of 33.34(SD 29.07). This difference represents a 10% difference of the total scale (100) for the measure and is considered clinically important by the review authors. <BR/>
<BR/>The CIMT group in <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> demonstrated a mean pre-treatment Assisting Hand Assessment score of -2.86 logits (SD 3.36) and control group -2.22 logits (SD 3.14). This difference represents 3% difference in total score (20 logits) of the measure and is unlikely to be clinically important. </P>
<P>No clinically important differences were seen in baseline characteristics or mean pre-treatment scores reported by <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>. Mean pre-treatment scores for the Forced Use group and control group respectively were: Box and Blocks Test, 8.17 (SD 5.03) and 8.46 (SD 7.29); Erhardt Developmental Prehension Assessment, 6.86 (SD 1.40) and 7.02 (SD 1.43); WeeFIM - mean total score, 82.44 (SD 13.97) and 79.92 (29.59). <BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Blinding <BR/>
</I>
</B>The inherent nature of a CIMT protocol did not allow blinding of participants or therapists to the intervention. Therefore, double blinding was not possible. In <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> outcome assessors were blinded for one outcome measure only, the Toddler Arm Use Test. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> used an outcome assessor blinded to the intervention group. <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> did not report blinding of outcome assessors.<B>

<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> reported no drop-outs. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> reported that four children did not complete treatment in a sample of 45. No intention-to-treat analyses were performed. <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> did not refer to drop-outs in their trial, therefore it is unknown if any children did not complete treatment.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The three trials included in this review used different outcome measures and substantial variation in intensity of treatment so a combined analysis of pooled data applying statistical methods was not possible or appropriate. All results reported below were analysed by the review authors using RevMan and include the standard mean difference and 95% confidence interval of each outcome. Further details of these analyses can be viewed in the analysis section of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> did not demonstrate a significant treatment effect on the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (Dissociated Movement subscale) based on change scores from baseline level of performance to immediately post treatment at 3 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.91, 95% CI -0.08 to 1.89). However, a trend favouring the CIMT group was evident. QUEST data were not reported at the six week, three month or six month follow-up. Other outcome measures used, such as the Pediatric Motor Activity Log, Emerging Behaviours Scale and Toddler Arm Use Test were developed specifically for this trial however their psychometric properties have not been reported. Results from the Pediatric Motor Activity Log - Frequency of Use subscale (SMD 1.53, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.62) and Emerging Behaviors Scale (SMD 1.22, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.24), both parent rated questionnaire-based measures, indicated a significant treatment effect immediately after treatment (at 3 weeks). The treatment effect for the Pediatric Motor Activity Log - Frequency of Use subscale remained significant at six weeks (SMD 1.30, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.34), however the Quality of Use subscale did not show a significant treatment effect from post-treatment (SMD 0.72, 95% CI -0.24 to 1.69) or at the six week follow up (SMD 0.67, 95% CI -0.29 to 1.63).<I> </I>
<I> </I>The blindly rated measure, the Toddler Arm Use Test, showed no significant difference between groups as demonstrated in the ANCOVA analysis (F=1.42, p=.25) reported in the dissertation. Further analysis in the publication (<LINK REF="REF-Taub-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 2004</LINK>) reported significant between group differences after treatment in percent of items for which children use their more affected arm and overall quality of use.</P>
<P>Analysis of<I> </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> data demonstrated a significant treatment effect at two months (SMD 1.12, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.78) and at six months (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.37) based on change scores of the Assisting Hand Assessment. These outcomes support the conclusion that over a six month period mCIMT induced a rate of improvement in bimanual performance using the hemiplegic hand that is greater than with traditional services.</P>
<P>The Forced Use trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> demonstrated a significant treatment effect at 6 weeks on one outcome measure, the self care component of the WeeFIM (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03). All other measures at 6 weeks, including the Erhardt Developmental Prehension Assessment (SMD 0.57 95% CI -0.16 to 1.30), Box and Blocks Test (SMD 0.67 95% CI -0.07 to 1.40), motor component - WeeFIM (SMD 0.40 95% CI -0.32 to 1.12), cognitive component - WeeFIM (SMD 0.54 95% CI -0.19 to 1.27) and total score - WeeFIM (SMD 0.54 95% CI -0.19 to - 1.27) demonstrated a trend favouring Forced Use but no significant treatment effect. <BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), mCIMT and Forced Use are emerging as treatment approaches for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (cerebral palsy). Three trials, with varying methodological quality and sample sizes have addressed their effects (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>). The three treatment protocols varied significantly, particularly in relation to the intensity of treatment, from no increase in conventional treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>) to six hours a day for 21 consecutive days (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Results from <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> on the Dissociated Movement subscale of the QUEST, which was scored by blinded raters and the only outcome measure with known validity and reliability, showed no statistically significant treatment effect at 95% level of confidence. This is despite a 14.23 (SD 17.48) point change in the CIMT group compared with -1.74 (16.02) in the control group, indicating that the result may be clinically significant. This discrepancy is most likely due to the small sample size of the study (n=18) resulting in inadequate power to detect statistical difference between groups. Significant treatment effects favouring CIMT however, were found by <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK> on parent response questionnaires that were without reported psychometric properties (Pediatric Motor Activity Log - Frequency of Use subscale, Emerging Behaviors Scale). Results from the Toddler Arm Use Test, using raters blind to group allocation, were not significant. The clinical significance of these results are not known due to the lack of known validity and reliability of the measures. </P>
<P>Using the Assisting Hand Assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 2003</LINK>), a newly developed assessment with evidence of adequate reliability and validity (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-_x0028_in-press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde (in press)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmefur-_x0028_in-press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmefur (in press)</LINK>), the CCT (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>) demonstrated a significant treatment effect at the two and six month follow-up. Although these results (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>) could be influenced by the possibility of selection bias due to lack of randomisation, baseline characteristics of children were similar. The mean age of children in the CIMT group was 28.8 months (SD 8.2) and control group 30.8 months (SD 10.9) while degree of hand function, according to the first measure of the Assisting Hand Assessment, gave a mean of -2.86 logits (SD 3.36) in the CIMT group and -2.22 logits (SD 3.14) in the control group. Potential inequalities between groups were also not likely to have impacted on outcomes as the analysis method used took into account baseline performance. </P>
<P>The Forced Use trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK> reports statistically significant results on all outcomes using what is described as 'non-parametric paired and unpaired t tests' (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>, p. 2196). However, despite a trend for improvement favouring the Forced Use group, further analysis using RevMan indicates a significant treatment effect for only one outcome, the self care component of the WeeFIM. The clinical significance of this treatment effect is questionable with a mean difference between groups of one point out of a possible 56. The authors of the review strongly recommend the findings from this trial be viewed with caution given the ambiguity of its specific methodology, lack of methodological rigour and inaccurate reporting. <BR/>
<BR/>Several lower-level trials have been published (see Characteristics of excluded studies table); however, given their poor methodological rigour and susceptibility to several types of bias their results cannot be included in a systematic review. Despite this, the information obtained from these studies can be useful in contributing to the knowledge base of the new intervention technique. As a result, some information from these lower-level studies has been used to discuss the implications for research and clinical practice but study results have not contributed to the estimate of the effectiveness of CIMT in cerebral palsy. </P>
<P>CIMT is a multi-faceted intervention that can have several variations in its design ranging from: method of restraint; length of restraint (per day, number of weeks); type and duration of therapy; intervention environment (that is home, school, or clinic) and intervention provider (therapist, parent, or teacher). Attributes of the children may also impact on their ability to respond to treatment including age, diagnosis, severity of motor and sensory impairment, co-morbidities, presence and impact of mirror movements, cognitive abilities and behaviour. </P>
<P>Important issues underpinning the use of CIMT that warrant further investigation include the following. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Method of restraint<BR/>
</I>
</B>A broad range of techniques have been used to restrain the non-affected upper limb in the paediatric CIMT studies published to date. These range from holding a child's hand (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 2005</LINK>), to using a glove or mitt (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2002</LINK>), forearm splints (<LINK REF="STD-Crocker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crocker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glover-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 2002</LINK>), slings (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>), short arm casts (<LINK REF="STD-Willis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yakusawa-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Yakusawa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>) and long arm casts (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>). There is inconsistency in the time the child's non-affected limb is restrained, varying from one hour per day (<LINK REF="STD-Naylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2002</LINK>) to all day (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>), and for a period of 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>) to two months (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although the type of restraint technique is not considered the important factor in a CIMT program, it does have an effect on several important aspects of the intervention. The use of a technique such as casting is the most invasive with the greatest potential for difficulties and adverse side effects. Casts may cause skin breakdown, rashes and irritation, limit the ability to use the unaffected hand for protective extension when falling, limit the role of the restrained hand as an assister or stabiliser during play and may be tolerated less well than a mitt or glove. Unsupervised play may also expose the child to frustrating experiences when attempting to rely solely on their affected hand with commonly used toys and activities. On the other hand, use of a permanent device such as a cast significantly increases the intensity of constraint. Despite the perceived negative or potential effects, there is little support within the current literature that more invasive restraint devices result in higher levels of drop-out from CIMT treatment. Studies reporting drop-outs used a variety of restraints including a mitt (n=4) (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>), resting splint (n=1) (<LINK REF="STD-Crocker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crocker 1997</LINK>) and short arm cast (n=not specified) (<LINK REF="STD-Willis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willis 2002</LINK>). Reasons reported included general irritation and withdrawal from play activities when the restraint was worn. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> reported a useful strategy of abandoning the restraint (mitt) if the child was unable to tolerate it after one week of trying. </P>
<P>Promising outcomes have been found in several CIMT studies using a variety of restraint techniques. However, there is insufficient support for the use of a specific device or technique. Literature results suggest that restraint of a non-affected limb using any of a range of techniques facilitates intensive practice of daily tasks. This intensive practice may not be possible using traditional occupational therapy approaches. Researchers should be aware of the potential impact their choice of restraint technique will have on: intensity of practice; behaviour; development; family and school life; amount of supervision required to avoid frustration; potential for frustration and adverse side effects; safety during falls; ability to use the restrained hand as an assist or stabiliser during play; and ability to practice skills in bimanual play when the device is removed. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Frequency and intensity of practice</I>
</B>
<B> <BR/>
</B>As with the variety of restraint techniques used in paediatric CIMT studies, the intensity of therapist-guided training also varied significantly. Intensities ranged from adopting a Forced Use protocol in which there was no increase in routine occupational therapy or physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Crocker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crocker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2005</LINK>) compared with up to eight hours per day of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Glover-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 2002</LINK>). There is currently no support for improved outcomes using the extremely intensive treatment protocols (that is six to eight hours per day) adopted in some studies. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> reported that the amount of improvement on the Assisting Hand Assessment did not correlate with time spent wearing the restraining mitt. </P>
<P>The intensity of treatment is likely to continue to vary across studies due to financial and resource issues. Future studies of CIMT in children need to establish a level of treatment intensity that is effective, developmentally appropriate and clinically feasible. It is unlikely that a protocol which includes six to eight hours per day of therapist-guided intervention can be adopted in the majority of clinical environments. It is also questionable that a protocol for young children (that is less than four years of age) which involves six hours of therapist-guided intervention is developmentally appropriate. Evolution of paediatric CIMT may see the establishment of different treatment protocols for very young children compared with older children in order to account for differences in developmental and social factors impacting on young children and adolescents. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Intervention environment and social contexts</I>
</B> <BR/>Across all studies there has been variation in the environment in which CIMT treatment was provided, including home (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>), pre-school (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>), a day camp (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2003</LINK>), hospital or university clinic facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Glover-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naylor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2002</LINK>) or a combination of these settings. Researchers have argued for using the child's natural environment (home or preschool) to facilitate the learning process (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>) whilst others recommend avoiding the home as this disrupts family life and tasks can be better controlled and distractions minimised in a clinic environment (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>These issues have not been examined empirically and environmental considerations are important to define and potentially manipulate in future research. Provision of therapy in the home may be viewed as intrusive or disruptive to family life as suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK> or it may facilitate a more efficient and cost-effective method of implementing CIMT. The education and utilisation of family, teachers and carers in the provision of intensive home and school programs, alongside therapist-guided sessions, would significantly reduce the overall costs associated with a CIMT program. It may also encourage parents to be more involved and confident in their child's treatment. Such a methodology was recently adopted by <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> and the utilisation of parents, caregiver, undergraduate students and teachers to implement CIMT treatment appears to be an emerging model for CIMT (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is not only the physical environmental context that can be modified in a CIMT program but also the social context. Most studies have provided individual treatment programs to children, however, protocols involving groups of children have also been studied. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2003</LINK> adopted a summer day camp model with nine adolescent children aged 13 to 18 years. This methodology was seen by researchers as an effective program for adolescents as it enabled participants to support and collaborate with each other and provided moral support. <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK> also used a group model with children aged 4 to 14 years reporting that it allowed social interaction, modeling and encouragement. </P>
<P>The environmental and social variables within a CIMT protocol need to be carefully considered in future research and will influence how CIMT is introduced into traditional healthcare settings. The economic viability of CIMT may depend on utilising home or school environments to achieve the required intensity of treatment. These environmental and social considerations coupled with parents and caregivers providing training warrant further evaluation. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Intervention principles</I>
</B>
<B> <BR/>
</B>The trend in most recent paediatric CIMT literature appears to be away from the adult CIMT protocol where an operant movement-conditioning approach, using shaping, is advocated as the underlying movement therapy principle. Two major approaches are being adopted and the difference appears to be related to the background of professions involved in current CIMT research. These include psychologists utilising operant movement conditioning (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK>) and occupational therapists or physiotherapists adopting a motor learning and motor control approach where motivating tasks are repetedly practiced (<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although not supported by the results of <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Taub-_x0026_-Wolf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub &amp; Wolf 1997</LINK> suggested that it is possible that the intensity at which the chosen treatment is provided, rather than the treatment principle, that will impact on CIMT outcomes. This should be examined empirically in future research. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Individual characteristics</I>
</B>
<B> <BR/>
</B>Studies published to date have provided limited information for therapists to determine which individual characteristics are related to positive CIMT outcomes. Factors such as age, severity of sensorimotor impairment, cognition, behaviour, side of hemiplegia and site of lesion all have the potential to impact on CIMT outcomes. </P>
<P>The most comprehensive investigation of individual characteristics was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>. Interestingly, the older children in their study made larger improvements. These results challenge the belief that younger children have increased potential for functional change due to neural plasticity. Children with very poor hand function also improved more than those with mild hand function impairment, in contrast to Taub's findings in adults post-stroke. <LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK> found that, based on the Motor Activity Log, "the amount of improvement produced by CIMT appears to diminish as the initial motor ability of patients decreases" (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-_x0026_-Taub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris &amp; Taub 2001</LINK>, p20). <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> suggested their findings may be due to several reasons including: the ability of children with more severe sensorimotor impairment to benefit more from extensive practice; the sensitivity of their outcome measure, the Assisting Hand Assessment, to measure even very low abilities; or their adapted CIMT treatment approach of one to two hours of practice each day. This reduced practice time may be more ideally suited to children with poor hand function than the six hours a day of practice which is commonly recommended in other models. </P>
<P>It is imperative that future research explores the impact of severity of sensorimotor impairment on CIMT outcomes. It is also important to explore the possibility of adjunct therapies which may impact on the underlying impairment in preparation for involvement in a CIMT program. Use of Botulinum toxin-A (Botox) injections to reduce the limiting effects of sensorimotor impairment (spasticity) prior to commencing a CIMT program has recently been discussed as a potentially effective combination in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 2001</LINK>) and adults post-stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2003</LINK>). This combination of treatments requires further evaluation and is currently being investigated (<LINK REF="STD-Hoare-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoare 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is not yet possible to accurately define the individual characteristics of children who will benefit from CIMT. The literature to date supports the inclusion of children in CIMT studies from across the spectrum of impairment levels (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK>). Future trials that clearly specify inclusion criteria and utilise common outcome measures will assist with determining likely candidates for this protocol. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Outcome measures</I>
</B>
<B> <BR/>
</B>The need for reliable and valid outcome measures that are responsive to changes in the use of the affected limb is paramount. Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeLuca-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DeLuca 2003</LINK>) have reported results using assessment tools developed specifically for evaluating their CIMT programs (Pediatric Motor Activity Log, Emerging Behaviors Scale, Toddler Arm Use Test); however, there are typically no accompanying psychometric data to inform clinicians of the tools validity or reliability. <LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> accurately reported that none of the norm-referenced tests (for example Peabody Developmental Motor Scale) available at present measure "the functional use of the hemiplegic hand in bimanual tasks, which is the overall goal of improvement for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy" (p273). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2005</LINK> suggested a range of assessments to quantify changes in movement patterns. This is appropriate if the aim of CIMT is to improve movement patterns. However, if it is more important to improve the performance, and independence in, daily activities, regardless of the movement patterns used other outcome measures are needed. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eliasson 2005</LINK> used the newly developed Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) as the outcome measure in their CIMT trial. This tool has evidence of adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness to change (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmefur-_x0028_in-press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmefur (in press)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-_x0028_in-press_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde (in press)</LINK>). The AHA is a standardised, criterion-referenced test for use with children aged 18 months to 12 years who have a unilateral upper limb impairment impacting their ability to perform bimanual tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 2003</LINK>). The AHA was developed to measure how effectively a child uses his or her affected hand in bimanual play activities, using 22 items. When developing the AHA, consideration was given to the underlying principle that skilled hand use is always influenced by a number of complex components including motor, perceptual, cognitive and environmental aspects. Unlike other assessments it does not set out to capture these specific aspects individually but rather the synthesis of all these components, which is the actual behavior or functional use of the assisting hand when performing tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Krumlinde-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumlinde 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Future CIMT studies should use valid and reliable measures of the usefulness of the affected upper limb in bimanual tasks and participation of children in life situations. The use of uniform outcomes across studies will allow pooling of data in meta-analysis and the establishment of long-term effects of CIMT programs beyond completion of treatment. </P>
<P>Given the paucity of evidence, the use of CIMT in children with cerebral palsy should still be considered experimental. Further adequately powered RCTs, using valid and reliable outcome measures, are required to explore the effectiveness of CIMT for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Future research in CIMT should investigate the most efficient, cost-effective, least invasive and family-friendly treatment protocol that can be easily replicated in a clinical setting.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review found a significant treatment effect using modified CIMT in a single trial. A positive trend favouring CIMT and Forced Use was also demonstrated. It is recommended that the use of CIMT, mCIMT and Forced Use should remain within clinical trials until the evidence is clearer.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review highlights the need for further high level, good quality research into the use of CIMT, mCIMT and Forced Use in the treatment of hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Suggestions for future research include conducting appropriately powered studies, and utilising uniform and objective outcome measures which will allow pooling of data in future meta analyses. Valid and reliable outcomes which measure the usefulness of the affected upper limb in bimanual tasks (for example the Assisting Hand Assessment) and individual goal setting (for example the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and Goal Attainment Scaling) should be included. Investigations should pursue longer-term outcomes and examine the individual characteristics of children who experience positive CIMT outcomes. The impact of varying intensities of treatment and the environment or social context in which the treatment is provided should also be examined with a view to optimising treatment protocols and enhancing treatment outcomes.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Use of a fabric glove with a built in stiff volar plastic splint on the "dominant " unaffected hand, preventing finger flexion and thumb movement. 2 months of intervention 7 days per week. Children were expected to wear the glove for 2 hours per day which could be split into different sessions. Treatment took place in child's usual environment (home/pre-school). Parents and/or pre-school teachers were responsible for accomplishing the intervention on a daily basis with therapist supervision once weekly. The treatment programme was based on principles of motor learning, as well as the knowledge of motor control. Treatment sessions were guided by motivation, activities of an appropriate level of difficulty, and repetition. There was no attempt to facilitate specific movement patterns.</P>
