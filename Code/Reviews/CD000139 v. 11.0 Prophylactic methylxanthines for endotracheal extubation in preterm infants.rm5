<P>Using methylxanthines to help wean babies from mechanical ventilation might help some babies.</P>
<P>Methylxanthines are drugs (such as caffeine) that can help improve breathing in preterm babies (babies born early). They can be given to preterm babies when weaning from machine assisted breathing (extubation from mechanical ventilation) is planned. Importantly, methylxanthines appear to improve the chances of normal brain development in preterm babies coming off the ventilator.</P>

<P>Weaning and extubating preterm infants on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for respiratory failure may be difficult. A significant contributing factor is thought to be the relatively poor respiratory drive and tendency to develop hypercarbia and apnoea, particularly in very preterm infants.

<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:45:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven studies were identified for inclusion. Methylxanthine treatment results in a reduction in failure of extubation within one week (summary RR 0.48, 95%CI 0.32 to 0.71; summary RD -0.27, 95%CI -0.39 to -0.15; NNT 4, 95%CI 3 to 7; six trials, 172 infants). There is significant heterogeneity in the RD meta-analysis perhaps related to the large variation in baseline rate in the control groups (range 20 to 100%).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The CAP trial enrolled the largest number of infants, but did not report extubation rates. In the caffeine group, there were lower rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, PDA ligation, cerebral palsy and death or major disability at 18 to 21 months. Infants receiving caffeine had reduced postmenstrual ages at time of discontinuing oxygen therapy, positive pressure ventilation and endotracheal intubation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-11 18:00:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines increase the chances of successful extubation of preterm infants within one week of age. Important neurodevelopmental outcomes are improved by methylxanthine therapy. In any future trials, there is a need to stratify infants by gestational age (a better indicator of immaturity than birth weight). Caffeine, with its wider therapeutic margin, would be the better treatment to evaluate against placebo.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:52:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-10-08 22:18:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When preterm infants have been given intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for respiratory failure, weaning from support and tracheal extubation may be difficult. A significant contributing factor is thought to be the relatively poor respiratory drive and tendency to develop hypercarbia and apnoea, particularly in very preterm infants. At any given gestational age the tendency to develop apnoea decreases with increasing postnatal age (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Weaning from support may be prolonged or, even if extubation is achieved, frequent episodes of apnoea may occur in association with respiratory failure (hypercarbia, hypoxaemia and acidosis) of sufficient severity as to lead to reintubation and the use of IPPV. As a consequence, the use of IPPV is prolonged with associated costs for higher dependency care and a potential for morbidity from the intervention.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-11 18:02:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines, including caffeine, theophylline and aminophylline, might increase the drive to breath and reduce apnoea, thereby improving effective extubation from IPPV.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-09 11:52:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In non-intubated preterm infants, methylxanthines appear to increase respiratory drive, reduce the number of apneic episodes and the need for IPPV (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, there is some physiological evidence that methylxanthines increase the breathing response to carbon dioxide (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Harmful effects could include acute toxicity (excessive central nervous system excitation or tachycardia) or alterations in neurological development. One observational study has suggested that administration is associated with higher rates of cerebral palsy, but better scores of psychometric testing in very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-10-08 22:24:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis of all randomised trials evaluating prophylactic methylxanthine used to limit the duration of mechanical ventilation provides good clinical instruction. This update includes a new large trial (<LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK>) that contributes new evidence regarding neonatal outcomes and neurodevelopment in infancy.</P>

Details of each study are described in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>Treatment consisted of aminophylline or theophylline in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barrington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1985</LINK>), and caffeine in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1991</LINK>) there was a control group and two treatment arms, one caffeine and one theophylline (see table 'Characteristics of included studies') and the results of these latter two were combined for this review.</P>
<P>Although all trials had the aim of improving the chances of successful extubation, protocols differed considerably. In three studies, the infants were extubated at a set time and then the need for reintubation within five days (<LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>), seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Barrington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 1993</LINK>) or at any time (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>) evaluated.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-11-09 12:14:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven trials are included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Barrington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1985</LINK>). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1985</LINK>) found significant reductions in failure of extubation within one week of commencing treatment.</P>
<P>Overall analysis of the six trials that reported on extubation failure showed that methylxanthine treatment results in a reduction in the incidence of failed extubation [summary RR 0.48 (95%CI 0.32 to 0.71)]. Overall there is an absolute reduction of 27 % in the incidence of failed extubation [summary RD -0.27 (95%CI -0.39 to -0.15)]. There is significant heterogeneity in the RD meta-analysis (p = 0.007, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 68.6) possibly related to the large variation in baseline rate in the control group (range 20 to 100%).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>) found that aminophylline treatment was effective in reducing failed extubation in those born at less than 1000 g and who were less than one week old [RR 0.40 (95%CI 0.16 to 0.95)]. In the other small prespecified subgroups in this trial, infants older than one week and those of birth weight 1000 to 1250 g who had failed extubation once, no significant benefit could be shown. Infants of less than 1000 g were followed and their neurodevelopmental status at 30 months and there was no significant difference between caffeine and no treatment (reported in an abstract by Piecuch in 1989).</P>
<P>Two trials reported side effects of methylxanthine treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1985</LINK> found 2/18 of the treatment group and 0/20 of the control infants had tachycardia or agitation leading to cessation of treatment. The other small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>) reported an increase in mean heart rate in infants treated with caffeine, but treatment was not withheld in any infant. The number of infants with reported side effects was small and the differences not significant.<BR/>
<BR/>Three trials reported rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD was defined as oxygen use at 28 days in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1991</LINK>) and undefined in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Muro-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muro 1992</LINK> there were no cases in either group; in <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1991</LINK> it occurred in 8/31 in the methylxanthine group and 5/14 in the placebo group; in <LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK> it occurred in 7/14 in the methylxanthine group versus 12/18 in the control infants of less than 1000 g who were extubated in the first week. Author clarification is required before these results can be combined.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK> trial did not report rates of extubation failure. In the subgroup of 717 infants given caffeine to facilitate extubation, the rate of PDA ligation in the neonatal period was significantly lower in the caffeine group [RR 0.32 (95%CI 0.20 to 0.52)]. There was a significantly reduced rate bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Chronic Lung Disease) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age in the caffeine group [672 infants, RR 0.81 (95%CI 0.70 to 0.93)].The mean postmenstrual age (PMA) at the last use of a number of therapies were significantly shorter in the caffeine group [oxygen therapy, 666 infants, MD -1.50 (95%CI -2.25 to -0.75)], endotracheal tube [668 infants, MD -0.90 (95%CI -1.42 to -0.38)], positive pressure ventilation [667 infants, MD -1.10 (95%CI -1.64 to -0.56)]. A reduction in cognitive delay at 18 to 21 months in the caffeine group was not statistically significant [612 infants, RR 0.83 (95%CI 0.68 to 1.01)]. The rate of cerebral palsy was lower in the caffeine group [644 infants, RR 0.54 (95%CI 0.32 to 0.92)] as was the rate of death or major disability by 18 to 21 months of age [676 infants, RR 0.85 (95%CI 0.73 to 0.99)].</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1985</LINK> trial a significantly higher lung compliance was found in treated infants at six hours after commencing theophylline.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barrington-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Barrington 1993</LINK>) examined respiratory occlusion pressures as a measure of respiratory drive before and after trial entry and found no significant difference between infants in the treatment and control group.</P>
<P>Postextubation nasal CPAP was used routinely in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1985</LINK>), but subgroup analysis suggests that the effects are similar whether or not it is used. Caffeine was more effective than control in their 25 routine CPAP infants (RR, 0.39, 95%CI 0.19 to 0.81).</P>

<P>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK>) reported neurodevelopmental status at follow-up. The large number of infants enrolled and high follow-up rates of the <LINK REF="STD-CAP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAP 2006</LINK> trial provides reassurance of the safety of methylxanthine therapy.</P>
<P>Postextubation nasal CPAP, which reduces the failure rate when extubating preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003a</LINK>) might have modified the response to methylxanthines. Subgroup analysis based on very small numbers of infants suggests that this does not account for any differences in results between trials.</P>

<P>Subgroup analysis in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Durand-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Durand 1987</LINK>) suggests that the only benefit might be found in infants born at less than 1000 g and extubated in the first week. No placebo was used in this trial and this is a potential source of bias. There is also caution warranted in interpreting this one study as there were more losses to follow up in the control (six) than the treatment group (one).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-25 06:06:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Other Cochrane reviews evaluate other interventions to assist extubation. There are insufficient trial data to evaluate the use of Doxapram (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2000</LINK>). Dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>) is effective in some infants. Low rate IPPV is more effective than CPAP via endotracheal tube prior to extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003a</LINK>) .</P>
<P>The effects of varying dosage of methylxanthines have not been assessed in this review. One randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Steer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 2003</LINK>) has assessed dosage of caffeine for extubation and shows that higher doses have more effect than standard doses. Dosage of methylxanthines needs more analysis in a review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-11 18:19:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines increase the chances of successful extubation of preterm infants within one week of commencing treatment. One trial suggests that this benefit is principally in infants of extremely low birth weight extubated in the first week. Methylxanthines also reduce the need for oxygen therapy and ventilator support and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infancy.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-09 02:00:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In any future trials there is a need to stratify infants by gestational age (a better indicator of immaturity than birth weight). Caffeine, with its wider therapeutic margin (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1998</LINK>) would be the better treatment to evaluate against placebo. </P>
