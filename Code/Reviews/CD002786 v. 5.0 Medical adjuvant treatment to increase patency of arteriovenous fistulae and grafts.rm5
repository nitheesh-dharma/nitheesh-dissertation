<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-16 08:06:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with advanced kidney disease (end-stage renal disease) need dialysis to perform kidney functions. In haemodialysis, blood is filtered through a machine. To allow a large enough passage for blood to flow between the person and the machine, an artery and a vein can be surgically joined (to form an arteriovenous fistula) or an artificial graft (a substitute for a vein) is used to join the artery to the vein. These access points might last for years but can become blocked or infected. This review investigates if additional medical therapy can keep these dialysis access points functioning.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors found 15 randomised controlled trials (evidence current to March 2015) with a total of 2230 participants, of anti-platelet drugs (such as ticlopidine, aspirin, dipyridamole and clopidogrel) or anti-thrombotic and other drug treatments used to prevent blockages in the artery and vein access points for dialysis. Where possible, similar studies were pooled. Pooled data from three trials (339 participants) comparing ticlopidine (a platelet aggregation inhibitor) with placebo, showed improved blood flow at one month. There was insufficient evidence of an effect on blood flow from pooled data from three trials comparing aspirin with placebo (175 participants) or from two trials using fish oil for 12 months (220 participants). Three studies assessed the effect of human type I pancreatic elastase (PRT-201) with placebo in 306 participants. Overall the trials showed there was insufficient evidence of an effect on blood flow between active treatment (PRT-201) and placebo. Two trials compared clopidogrel with placebo in 959 participants and again showed there was insufficient evidence of an effect between the treatments. Single trials involving 16 to 36 participants compared dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin or sulphinpyrazone (a uricosuric drug) with placebo. The estimated effects were compatible with both benefits and harm. One trial comparing warfarin with placebo (107 participants) was terminated early because of major bleeding events in the warfarin group. Only two studies reported on related interventions (surgical or radiological); there was insufficient evidence of an effect on related interventions between placebo and treatment. No studies reported on the length of hospital stay and information on complications of treatment was limited and, if reported, varied from study to study. Most had a short follow-up period so that any benefits in the longer term are not clear.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was low due to short follow-up periods, small number of studies for each comparison, and differences between the studies (in follow-up time and dosages used). In addition the methodological quality of the studies was moderate due to incomplete reporting.</P>

<P>For this update, the two review authors (NCT, ADS) independently assessed trial quality and one review author (NCT) extracted data. Information on adverse events was collected from the trials. The primary outcome was the long-term fistula or graft patency rate. Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay, complications and number of related surgical interventions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, an additional six studies were deemed suitable for inclusion, making a total of 15 trials with 2230 participants. Overall the quality of the evidence was low due to short follow-up periods, heterogeneity between trials and moderate methodological quality of the studies due to incomplete reporting. Medical adjuvant treatments used in the trials were aspirin, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin, warfarin, fish oil, clopidogrel, sulphinpyrazone, and human type I pancreatic elastase (PRT-201). Where possible, the included studies were pooled into similar medical adjuvant groups for meta-analyses.</P>
<P>All included studies reported on graft patency by measuring graft thrombosis. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency in studies comparing aspirin versus placebo (three RCTs, 175 participants) (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 2.25; P = 0.30). The meta-analysis for graft patency comparing ticlopidine versus placebo (three RCTs, 339 participants) favoured ticlopidine (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82; P = 0.009). There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency in studies comparing fish oil versus placebo (two RCTs, 220 participants; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95; P = 0.18); and studies comparing clopidogrel and placebo (two RCTs, 959 participants; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; P = 0.10). Similarly, there was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency in three studies (306 participants) comparing PRT-201 versus placebo (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; P = 0.31); in one trial comparing the effect of dipyridamole versus placebo (42 participants; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.94, P = 0.29) and dipyridamole plus aspirin versus placebo (41 participants; OR 0.64, CI 0.16 to 2.56, P = 0.52); in one trial comparing low-dose warfarin with placebo (107 participants; OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.99, P = 0.17); and one trial (16 participants) comparing sulphinpyrazone versus placebo (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.03 to 5.98, P = 0.53). The single trial evaluating warfarin was terminated early because of major bleeding events in the warfarin group. Only two studies published data on the secondary outcome of related interventions (surgical or radiological); there was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in related interventions between placebo and treatment groups. No studies reported on the length of hospital stay and data reporting on complications was limited and varied between studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:07:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analyses of three studies for ticlopidine (an anti-platelet treatment), which all used the same dose of treatment but with a short follow-up of only one month, suggest ticlopidine may have a beneficial effect as an adjuvant treatment to increase the patency of AV fistulae and grafts in the short term. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency between placebo and other treatments such as aspirin, fish oil, clopidogrel, PRT-201, dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin, warfarin, and sulphinpyrazone. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to short follow-up periods, the small number of studies for each comparison, heterogeneity between trials and moderate methodological quality of the studies due to incomplete reporting. It, therefore, appears reasonable to suggest further prospective studies be undertaken to assess the use of these anti-platelet drugs in renal patients with an arteriovenous fistula or graft.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-16 08:06:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients continue to die prematurely despite continuing advances in our knowledge on dialysis. Renal patients on long-term haemodialysis require either an autologous (using the individual's own tissue) arteriovenous (AV) fistula (when an artery is connected to a vein) or an AV interposition prosthetic shunt (when an artery is connected to a vein through an artificial graft) for access. These access sites should ideally have a long life and a low rate of complications (for example thrombosis, infection, stenosis, aneurysm formation and distal limb ischaemia). Currently, there is no access type that fulfils all these criteria. However, long-term (up to four or five years) patency rates demonstrate that autologous AV fistulae have the best outcomes with fewer surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metha-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metha 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pisoni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisoni 2002</LINK>). Complications from haemodialysis access result in frequent hospitalisation of patients with ESRD and often require further intervention.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:07:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although some of the complications may be unavoidable, any adjuvant technique or medical treatment aimed at decreasing complications would be welcome. It is recognised that up to 85% of cases of vascular access failure may be due to thrombosis caused by myointimal hyperplasia (proliferation of the cells lining the blood vessel), particularly in prosthetic grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Kanterman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanterman 1995</LINK>). There is already some evidence suggesting that the formation of an autologous AV fistula may be preferable to prosthetic material and that graft surveillance programmes lead to improvements in long-term graft patency rates (National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative) (<LINK REF="REF-DOQI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOQI 1997</LINK>). However, there is also some accumulating evidence that drug manipulation for patients with ESRD and autologous AV fistula (<LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK>), and those with prosthetic interposition AV shunts (<LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2002</LINK>), may confer additional benefits in terms of long-term patency and fewer complications.</P>

Quality was assessed using the 'Risk of bias' tool as described in section 8.5 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This assesses various domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and &#8216;other bias&#8217;) and determines the level of bias for each domain, namely 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias.

<P>Three trials had unit of analysis issues which required further evaluation by the review authors.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK> study had a non-standard design as it allowed people who had an initial failed AV fistula formation to re-enter the study after a three week 'washout period'. In addition, the published results had to be carefully interpreted as there was confusion between the number of participants within the study compared to the number of operations (i.e. AV fistulae formed), and participants who died were excluded from the published analysis. Overall analysis for this review was undertaken using the number of operations performed on an 'intention-to-treat' basis.</P>
<P>The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK> study had to be carefully assessed by the review authors as the original data were not analysed on an 'intention-to-treat' basis, but analysed by the number of participants who completed the trial.</P>

<P>Three of the trials compared the effect of aspirin versus placebo and included a total of 175 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Harter 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK>). The follow-up time and the dosage of aspirin given were different in each of the trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK>, 39 participants undergoing insertion of a new arteriovenous (AV) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft were followed up for 18 months over a period of six years. Twenty participants received aspirin 325 mg once daily and the remainder received placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK> included 92 participants undergoing Brescia-Cimino fistula formation. Of these, 45 participants received aspirin 500 mg once daily whereas the other 47 participants were given placebo. The total follow-up period was 28 days. Finally, the Harter trial included 44 participants undergoing AV shunt formation between the radial artery and the cephalic vein using silastic (silicone rubber) material with a Teflon adapter (<LINK REF="STD-Harter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Harter 1979</LINK>). Nineteen participants received a single dose of 160 mg once-daily aspirin and 25 participants received placebo. The follow-up period was approximately five months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK> also examined the effects of dipyridamole versus placebo with a total number of 42 participants in a parallel group trial over a six-year period. Twenty-three participants received dipyridamole at a dose of 75 mg three times a day; the other 19 received the equivalent placebo. All participants were followed up for 18 months.</P>
<P>In a separate arm of the trial, <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK> studied the effect a combination of dipyridamole and aspirin had versus placebo. Forty-one participants were involved (22 receiving dipyridamole 75 mg with 325 mg aspirin daily; 19 participants taking placebo).</P>
<P>Only type I participants (participants requiring a new AV expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft) were included in all analyses of this review. Additional data on type II participants (participants with an ePTFE graft which had thrombosed requiring thrombectomy or additional PTFE jump graft) was provided but not included for analysis as it was decided this cohort was high risk for thrombosis and did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Three trials compared ticlopidine with placebo, with a total number of 339 participants undergoing AV fistula formation or graft interposition (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK>). There were no separate data for participants undergoing either fistula formation or graft interposition. Each participant was given either 250 mg of ticlopidine twice daily or the equivalent placebo. All participants were followed up for one month in all three trials.</P>
<P>Two trials examined the effects of fish oil (4 g once daily) versus placebo, and included a total of 220 participants undergoing graft formation with a follow-up time of 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2002</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2002</LINK> trial 24 participants were enrolled (12 participants received fish oil and 12 received an equivalent dose of a control oil). The primary outcome was graft thrombosis, but the authors did not state how patency was assessed. The <LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK> trial included 196 participants (99 participants received fish oil and 97 received a placebo oil capsule). The primary outcome was loss of native patency, which was defined as the graft having a primary event of thrombosis or requiring radiological or surgical intervention to maintain patency or promote maturation. However, they did provide separate data on graft thrombosis and this was included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2002</LINK> compared the effects of low intensity warfarin treatment (variable dose but a target international normalised ratio (INR) for prothrombin time of 1.4 to 1.9) with placebo. A total of 107 participants were randomised (56 to warfarin and 51 to placebo); all had newly placed PTFE grafts. How the authors assessed patency was not clear in that graft thrombosis was described as the "inability to dialyse or the need for immediate intervention to allow dialysis". This study was terminated early due a high rate of serious adverse events in the treatment arm.</P>
<P>Two trials compared the effects of clopidogrel versus placebo and included a total of 959 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK> assessed 866 participants for patency failure six weeks after native arteriovenous fistula formation. A total of 436 participants received a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel on postoperative day one followed by 75 mg daily; and 430 received matching placebo daily. <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK> compared 46 participants who received 75 mg clopidogrel daily with 47 who received placebo. Treatment was initiated 7 to 10 days prior to formation of a native arteriovenous fistula and continued for six weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome was fistula failure at eight weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Michie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Michie 1977</LINK> compared the uricosuric drug sulphinpyrazone (200 mg four times daily) with placebo. Sixteen participants were randomised (eight to each group). There was heterogeneity across the treatment groups (six participants had AV fistulae and two had bovine interposition grafts in both groups). Participants were followed up for approximately three months or until 33 dialysis sessions had been undertaken.</P>
<P>Two trials from the same investigational group assessed the effect of a recombinant type I pancreatic elastase (PRT-201) applied directly to the adventitia of the inflow and outflow blood vessels of newly-created radiocephalic or brachiocephalic fistulae (<LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK>). The phase 1 trial compared 45 participants who received a variety of different doses of PRT-201 to 21 participants who received placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK>). The phase 2 trial compared 51 participants receiving placebo to 51 participants who received 10 &#956;g, and 49 participants who received 30 &#956;g, of PRT-201 (<LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK>). All participants in both trials were followed up for 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Dwivedi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dwivedi 2014</LINK> also investigated the effect of PRT-201 on AV grafts. This compared 28 participants who received placebo compared to 61 participants who received varying doses of PRT-201 applied directly to the vein-graft anastomosis and the adjacent outflow vein at the time of AV graft construction. All participants were followed up for 12 months.</P>
<P>In most studies, patency of AV shunts and grafts was assessed by detecting the presence of fistula or graft thrombosis. In the <LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK> studies, fistula clotting was detected by palpation (touch) and auscultation (listening with a stethoscope). In addition to those parameters, <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK> also included the presence of thrombus that was noticed during introduction of the dialysis needle into the graft, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Dwivedi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dwivedi 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK> studies added the use of Doppler technique to confirm the presence or absence of blood flow. The Harter study documented thrombosis by physical removal of thrombi from either the venous or arterial limbs of the shunt when dialysis was initiated (<LINK REF="STD-Harter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Harter 1979</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2002</LINK> study defined graft thrombosis as an inability to dialyze or a need for immediate intervention to allow dialysis; and the earlier <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1985</LINK> study documented patency by simply stating that each fistula was assessed at regular intervals. The <LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK> study monitored participants biweekly and performed an angiogram if decreasing dialysis flow rates indicated stenosis. <LINK REF="STD-Michie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Michie 1977</LINK> used Doppler, ease of cannulation, palpation and auscultation to assess patency; there was no documentation of how patency was assessed in the Fiskerstrand or Schmitz studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Thirteen published studies were reviewed as they appeared to meet the review inclusion criteria, but the study designs did not incorporate a placebo-controlled group (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhomi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhomi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ayala-2008" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ayala 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malovrh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malovrh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trimarchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Trimarchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yuto 2012</LINK>); or were not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Janicki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Janicki 2003</LINK>). These were therefore not deemed suitable for inclusion in the review. <LINK REF="STD-Trimarchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Trimarchi 2006</LINK> had been included in previous editions of this Cochrane review but on repeat evaluation it was concluded that the study did not meet inclusion criteria as there was no placebo-controlled arm to the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Malovrh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malovrh 2009</LINK>, evaluating the effect of blood volume expansion during surgery, did not use a suitable randomisation method or have placebo-controlled groups, and was deemed not to meet review criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Rouzrokh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rouzrokh 2009</LINK> presented unclear results which included an assessment of fistula patency, but the timeframe of treatment or assessment was not documented. These data could not therefore be included for analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Wasse-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wasse 2014</LINK> provided data on the percentage of participants who were successfully using their AV fistula or AV graft at six months but did not provide data to calculate the number of thromboses and therefore patency. There are multiple reasons why a fistula may not be used after creation besides loss of patency, therefore this study was excluded. A Dutch randomised placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of fish oil and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-De-Fijter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">De Fijter 1995</LINK>). However the trial outcomes did not include fistula patency and participants included both those on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. A single study examining the effect of sulphinpyrazone versus placebo was also considered (<LINK REF="STD-Kaegi-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Kaegi 1975</LINK>). Some of the participants also received warfarin either at the start or during the trial and, as the method for randomisation was not clearly concealed, this study was not included in this review. We excluded the <LINK REF="STD-Kooistra-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kooistra 1994</LINK> trial because long-standing (more than 6 weeks old) AV fistulae were assessed, and concurrent initiation of recombinant human erythropoietin with antiplatelet agent was studied, which we deemed a confounding factor. Another considered study analysed the effects of clopidogrel and aspirin versus placebo on rates of thrombosis in PTFE grafts (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 2003</LINK>). However, the total number of thrombotic episodes in each group could not be determined from the results and so the study was excluded. A further trial examined the effects of pentoxifylline versus placebo on rates of thrombosis in external AV fistulae (<LINK REF="STD-Radmilovic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Radmilovic 1998</LINK>). As this method of fistula formation is now obsolete, the authors felt that including this study would be inappropriate. One trial sought to assess the effects of CJC-1004 (a locally acting anti-thrombotic agent) on graft occlusion (<LINK REF="STD-Dulude-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dulude 2001</LINK>). However, this was published as an abstract and, despite a literature search, no follow-up paper could be found. Similarly, no relevant data were published by <LINK REF="STD-Alexopoulos-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alexopoulos 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krasinski-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krasinski 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taber-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Taber 1992</LINK>. One further reference to a study that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria was retrieved (<LINK REF="STD-Mileti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mileti 1995</LINK>). The reference described the rationale and design of an ongoing study. No results have been published.</P>

A total number of 39 complications were recorded in participants taking placebo. There were four deaths in the placebo group and two in the ticlopidine group.</P>
<P>The Crowther study also included information on bleeding complications for participants receiving warfarin (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2002</LINK>). Six major bleeds occurred in five participants: three upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, one cerebral haematoma after a road traffic accident, and one femoral artery injury after coronary angiography. All five of the participants were also taking anti-platelet therapy at the time of the bleeding event. A further 18 participants (7 allocated to placebo) experienced a minor bleeding event, however according to the study authors there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.30). There were five deaths in the treatment group and seven in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK> also reported data on bleeding complications and mortality occurring within 30 days of completion of study medications for participants taking clopidogrel and placebo. Overall, bleeding events were similar for both groups (2.9% versus 2.8% respectively, P = 0.84) as was all-cause mortality (0.9 in both groups) as reported by the study authors.</P>
<P>The Ghorbani study evaluating the effects of clopidogrel included information on bleeding and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK>). GI bleeding was reported in 2.1% of the treatment group and 3.2% of the placebo group (P = 0.31), and non-GI tract bleeding in 5.3% and 4.3% respectively (P = 0.63). There were two mortalities in both groups. There was no severe bleeding during the active treatment period and no deaths were attributable to bleeding.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK> stated that 34 participants experienced adverse events which resulted in discontinuation of study medication (combination of dipyridamole, aspirin or placebo). These participants were considered to have completed the study protocol however. The most common adverse events were GI bleeding and nausea across all study groups. There were also seven mortalities during the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK> did include data on mortality, reporting that 16 participants died (8 in each group) after starting the study medication but before 12 months of follow-up were completed.</P>
<P>The only adverse event reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 1984</LINK> was the development of a rash in a single participant treated with ticlopidine. No data on mortality were stated.</P>
<P>The Andrassy study comparing aspirin and placebo reported a greater risk of gastric pain and epistaxis (11% aspirin: 4% placebo) for participants but the risk of GI bleeding or wound hematoma was the same in both groups (4% in both arms) (<LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK>).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Dwivedi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dwivedi 2014</LINK> study comparing various doses of PRT-201 versus placebo calculated the rate of all procedures required to restore or maintain patency as a mean number per participant per year.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:09:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All but three (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK>) of the 14 included studies revealed a beneficial effect with the active drug. However, there may be an element of bias due to clinical heterogeneity with the dose and length of follow-up in the aspirin trials. In addition, one of the aspirin trials was conducted over 40 years ago with a relatively high dose of aspirin (500 mg/once daily) (<LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK>). It should be noted that there was a marked discrepancy between results in the aspirin versus placebo trials, with <LINK REF="STD-Sreedhara-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sreedhara 1994</LINK> favouring placebo and the <LINK REF="STD-Andrassy-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Andrassy 1974</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Harter 1979</LINK> studies favouring treatment. The authors in the Sreedhara study postulate several possible biochemical and pharmacological actions of aspirin that may have worsened its results.</P>
<P>The results in the ticlopidine trials clearly favoured anti-platelet treatment, using a dose of 250 mg twice daily, although the follow-up time was only one month (<LINK REF="STD-Fiskerstrand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fiskerstrand 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Crowther study, comparing warfarin against placebo, had the longest follow-up at 37 months (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2002</LINK>). Despite this, there was no beneficial effect on the group of participants treated with warfarin. This study was stopped prematurely due to serious side effects. Therefore, the risk-benefit does not favour anticoagulation unless there is another established indication.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lok-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 2012</LINK> studied the effect of fish oil on graft patency and both trials favoured treatment. However, there was statistically significant heterogeneity between the trials (despite the same dose and length of follow-up) and the random-effects meta-analysis showed no difference between the treatments.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Michie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Michie 1977</LINK> appears to show a benefit in terms of reducing graft thrombosis in participants treated with sulphinpyrazone. However, this study was conducted over 30 years ago with relatively small participant numbers and over a short follow-up period (three months). Again, there is insufficient evidence from a single trial to recommend its use.</P>
<P>The clopidogrel versus placebo trials showed a beneficial effect in favour of 75 mg/day clopidogrel but the random-effects meta-analysis showed no difference between treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK>). There was statistical heterogeneity and the weighting of the meta-analysis was biased towards the much larger Dember trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dember-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dember 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dwivedi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dwivedi 2014</LINK> studied the effect of PRT-201 versus placebo. The <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK> studies were phase 1 and phase 2 trials using a variety of active treatment doses (range 3.3 &#956;g to 9000 &#956;g) on AV fistulae. The follow-up for both trials was 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Peden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peden 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hye-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hye 2014</LINK> did not find a difference between treatment and placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Dwivedi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dwivedi 2014</LINK> looked at AV grafts but again used a variety of treatment doses (0.01 mg to 9.0 mg). Outcomes were reported after 12 months, and showed a non-significant benefit in favour of treatment. The overall meta-analysis of the three studies showed there was insufficient evidence of, and effect on, graft patency between PRT-201 and placebo.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that at least in the short term anti-platelet drugs such as ticlopidine may have some clinical advantages compared with placebo. No trials with follow-up longer than 36 months demonstrated a beneficial effect of anti-thrombotic or anti-platelet treatment to increase patency of arteriovenous fistulae and grafts, thus their long-term effect remains unclear.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:09:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limitations of this meta-analysis deserve to be mentioned. Firstly, some of the trials are not recent (the most recent was from 2014 but three are 30 or more years old). Additionally, most of the trials had a short period of follow-up and many of the comparisons included only one or two studies. The methodological quality of the trials was moderate mainly due to the variation in detail provided in the study reports. Finally, there is evidence of heterogeneity in the aspirin, fish oil and clopidogrel trials. Therefore the overall quality of the evidence within this review is classed as low.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A thorough search for potential studies was performed.</P>
<P>For three trials unit of analysis issues were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1998</LINK> study had a non-standard design as it allowed participants who had an initial failed AV fistula formation to re-enter the study after a three week 'washout period'. According to the study authors 25 participants re-entered the trial (12 in placebo and 13 in ticlopidine group). In addition the published results had to be carefully interpreted as there was confusion between the number of participants within the study compared to the number of operations (i.e. AV fistulae formed), and participants who died were excluded from the published analysis. Overall analysis for this review was undertaken using the number of operations performed on an 'intention-to-treat' basis. In total 258 participants were randomised with a total of 285 operations.</P>
<P>The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Ghorbani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ghorbani 2009</LINK> study had to be carefully assessed by the review authors as the original data was not analysed on an 'intention-to-treat' basis, but analysed by the number of participants who completed the trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grontoft-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Grontoft 1985</LINK> also published their analysed results based on the number of participants who completed the trial, not on an 'intention-to-treat' basis. As review authors it was not possible to use the intention-to-treat numbers because insufficient data regarding the original randomisation groups were provided. We therefore used the numbers of participants who completed the trial.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome 'graft patency', the numbers recorded for analyses were the number of grafts that occluded during the specified time period as reported by the study authors. This should be kept in mind when interpreting the presented data.</P>

<P>A meta-analysis published by <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2010</LINK> found a beneficial effect of antiplatelet agents in reducing thrombosis in arteriovenous fistulae but not with grafts. There is significant cross-over with our review however, as <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2010</LINK> included 10 studies in total in their meta-analysis, and 8 of these studies are also included within our review. For our review <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 2009</LINK> was deemed not suitable for inclusion as there was cross-over between participants who were prescribed aspirin prior to the trial; and <LINK REF="STD-Kooistra-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kooistra 1994</LINK> assessed participants who had concurrent administration of recombinant human erythropoietin and aspirin, so this was deemed to be confounding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:09:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analyses of three studies for ticlopidine (an anti-platelet treatment) which all used the same dose of treatment but with a short follow-up of only one month, suggest ticlopidine may have a beneficial effect as an adjuvant treatment to increase the patency of AV fistulae and grafts in the short term. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency between placebo and other treatments such as aspirin, fish oil, clopidogrel, PRT-201, dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin, warfarin, and sulphinpyrazone. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to short follow-up periods, the small number of studies for each comparison, heterogeneity between trials, and moderate methodological quality of the studies due to incomplete reporting. It therefore appears reasonable to suggest further prospective studies be undertaken to assess the use of these anti-platelet drugs in renal patients with an arteriovenous fistula or graft.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-14 09:09:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clearly there is a lack of evidence confirming the long-term effects of anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic drugs. Further randomised controlled trials with at least one or two years' follow-up are required to address these clinical issues.</P>
