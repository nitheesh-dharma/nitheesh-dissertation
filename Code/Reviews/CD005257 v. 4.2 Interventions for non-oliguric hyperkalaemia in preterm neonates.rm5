<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-10 20:28:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Elevated levels of potassium (an important salt for normal body functions) are common in infants born very preterm or with birth weight less than 1500 g. High potassium levels in the blood may lead to irregular or rapid heart rate that may result in bleedings in the brain and/or sudden death. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for this serious condition. Two studies enrolling 52 infants that assessed the use of a combination of insulin and sugar to reduce the blood levels of potassium were identified. This combination reduced the duration of high blood levels of potassium and the risk for bleeds in the brains of the infants. One study that enrolled 19 patients reported on the use of albuterol (a medication that helps to move potassium from the blood to the body cells). Albuterol lowered the blood levels of potassium both at four and at eight hours after the treatment had started. Because of the few infants enrolled in the studies to date, no firm recommendations for the treatment of too high blood levels of potassium in neonates can be made. Further research is needed.</P>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-03-27 11:55:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia [for the purpose of this review defined as serum potassium &gt; 6.0 mmol/L (the clinical setting in which interventions would likely be introduced prior to reaching a grossly abnormal level) and urine output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/hour] in preterm or VLBW infants during their first 72 hours of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-27 11:59:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2006) was searched to identify relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. The following data bases were searched in June 2006; MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982. Search updated in June 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-03-27 12:01:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials conducted in preterm and/or VLBW neonates with a diagnosis of non-oliguric hyperkalaemia. Interventions included were those aimed at redistributing serum potassium (sodium bicarbonate or insulin and glucose) or increasing the elimination of potassium from the body [diuretics (any type) or ion exchange resins (any type), or exchange transfusion, or peritoneal dialysis, or salbutamol, or albuterol] or counteracting potential arrhythmias from hyperkalaemia (calcium) versus placebo or no intervention; or comparing any two of these interventions. Primary outcome measure was 'All cause mortality during initial hospital stay'. Secondary outcomes included common adverse outcomes seen in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-10 20:13:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Two authors assessed all studies identified as potentially relevant by the literature search for inclusion in the review. Statistical methods included relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) for dichotomous and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed effect model for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I squared (I<SUP>2 </SUP>) statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-10 21:18:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three randomised trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia. Urine output was ascertained in only one study (<A HREF="Hu 1999">Hu 1999</A>). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (<A HREF="Malone 1991">Malone 1991</A>), 19 (<A HREF="Singh 2002">Singh 2002</A>) and 40 infants enrolled (<A HREF="Hu 1999">Hu 1999</A>). The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; <A HREF="Hu 1999">Hu 1999</A>).</P>
<P>One study (<A HREF="Malone 1991">Malone 1991</A>), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09 to -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1 to 5)]. In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage &#8805; grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 to 13).</P>
<P>Albuterol inhalation versus saline inhalation changed serum K+ from baseline at four hours [WMD -0.69 mmol/L (95% CI -0.87 to -0.51)] and at eight hours [WMD -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.78 to -0.40)] after initiation of treatment. No differences noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (<A HREF="Singh 2002">Singh 2002</A>).</P>
<P>No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation. Other interventions listed in our objectives have not been studied to date.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-26 13:07:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made. It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants. Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study. The two interventions could possibly be tested against each other. The effectiveness of other potentially effective interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia (diuretics, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis and calcium) have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.</P>

<I>Definition: </I>The normal range for plasma (serum) potassium in the neonate is 4.5 to 6.5 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-Lackmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chevalier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chevalier 1998</LINK>). Reversible hyperkalaemia in preterm infants, first reported by Usher in 1959 (<LINK REF="REF-Usher-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usher 1959</LINK>), is now referred to as non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Gruskay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruskay 1988</LINK>). Plasma potassium levels depend on the balance between potassium intake, intracellular/extra cellular distribution and renal and fecal excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Chevalier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chevalier 1998</LINK>). Non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the newborn is defined as a plasma potassium level &gt; 6.5 mmol/L in the absence of acute renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Gruskay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruskay 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>). As interventions to decrease plasma potassium levels would most likely be introduced in the clinical setting prior to reaching &gt; 6.5 mmol/ L, a plasma (serum) level of &gt; 6.0 mmol/L was chosen as the cut-off for the definition of hyperkalaemia for this review.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Burden of illness: </I>Hyperkalaemia is a common complication in the first 48 hours of life in very low birth weight (BW &lt; 1500 g) and/or very preterm newborns (&lt; 32 weeks gestational age). Omar (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2000</LINK>), quoting studies published between 1988 and 1997, reported that non-oliguric hyperkalaemia affected 30% to 50% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. In a cohort of 32 infants with birth weight &lt; 800 g who survived at least 24 hours, 16 (50 %) developed hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>). All infants of less than 25 weeks' gestation developed hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>). The incidence of hyperkalaemia (defined in this study as two successive serum potassium measurements of &gt; 7.5 mmol/L) in an unselected cohort of 200 VLBW infants was 3.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Shortland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortland 1987</LINK>). Hyperkalaemic infants have a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias (60%), impaired renal function (50%) (based on abnormal serum urea or creatinine concentrations) and changes on cerebral ultrasonography (88%) (<LINK REF="REF-Shortland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortland 1987</LINK>). A temporal association between hyperkalaemia, cardiac arrhythmias and periventricular leukomalacia suggests a causal association (<LINK REF="REF-Shortland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortland 1987</LINK>). Among seven infants with cardiac arrhythmias secondary to hyperkalaemia, only one survived (<LINK REF="REF-Sychlowy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sychlowy 1990</LINK>). In a descriptive review of perinatal mortality in a regional perinatal centre in Canada between 1980 to 1984, 11 of 89 (12%) early neonatal deaths in infants with a BW &lt; 1000 grams were associated with hyperkalaemia and cardiac arrhythmia (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1987a</LINK>). In 2002, 17 neonatal intensive care units reported that one or more deaths related to non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the preterm infant had occurred in their units (<LINK REF="REF-Mildenberger-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mildenberger 2002b</LINK>). Antenatal maternal corticosteroid treatment may prevent non-oliguric hyperkalaemia in extremely low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uga-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uga 2003</LINK>). With an increased use of antenatal steroids especially in the very early gestations the incidence of non-oliguric hyperkalaemia may now be lower than previously reported. With the high rates of mortality, cardiac arrhythmias and need for emergency measures associated with non-oliguric hyperkalaemia, it is likely that many of the common morbidities of VLBW infants (intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, adverse long-term outcomes) would be influenced by the condition and possibly reduced by interventions for its treatment.</P>
<P>
<I>Pathophysiology: </I>Non-oliguric hyperkalaemia in VLBW infants is not a result of increased potassium intake or decreased potassium excretion. It is due mainly to a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space associated with a decrease in the erythrocyte Na+, K+ - ATPase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Stefano-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefano 1993</LINK>). Non-oliguric hyperkalaemia of the preterm infant is unrelated to leakage of potassium from cell disruption associated with bruising, intracranial haemorrhage, or haemolysis, perinatal asphyxia or acidosis, glucose tolerance and catabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Gruskay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruskay 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brion-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stefano-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stefano-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefano 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sato-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mildenberger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mildenberger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<I>Treatment: </I>Postnatal therapeutic measures aim to redistribute potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, to remove potassium from the body and/or to decrease the arrhythmogenicity of hyperkalaemia.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Bicarbonate therapy has been recommended for the acute treatment of neonatal hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Brion-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1989</LINK>), as acidosis decreases the renal excretion of potassium and increases the arrhythmogenicity of hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Perkin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkin 1980</LINK>). Both insulin and glucose decrease serum potassium by facilitating potassium transport into the intracellular space. The use of insulin for hyperkalaemia has been documented in one case report (<LINK REF="REF-Heyman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyman 1989</LINK>) and two retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sychlowy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sychlowy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lui 1992</LINK>). Of the diuretics, furosemide exerts the most pronounced kaliuretic effect and its use to treat hyperkalaemia has been reported in one preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Gruskay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruskay 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potassium elimination can be enhanced by ion resins, but hyperkalaemic neonates have developed gastro-intestinal obstruction and/or perforation following oral or rectal administration of exchange resins (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sychlowy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sychlowy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grammatikopoulos-03" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grammatikopoulos 03</LINK>).<I> </I>Exchange transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Setzer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setzer 1984</LINK>) and peritoneal dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Shortland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shortland 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>) provide treatment options after failure of other interventions. <I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>The effect of salbutamol on transmembrane potassium flux has been studied in neonatal red blood cells under hyperkalaemic conditions and resulted in a 50% increase in net transmembrane potassium flux (<LINK REF="REF-Angelopoulous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelopoulous 1996</LINK>). Salbutamol infusion (but not inhalation) for hyperkalaemia has been reported in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dilmen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dilmen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Avenarius-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenarius 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm infants commonly experience hypocalcaemia during their first 24 to 48 hours of life, at a time when non-oliguric hyperkalaemia occurs, and case reports support the administration of intravenous calcium for cardiac arrhythmias secondary to hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kilbride-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilbride 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1996</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-04-10 21:01:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by each review author using the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration, focusing on concealment of allocation, blinding of the intervention, completeness of follow-up and blinding of the outcome assessors.</P>
<P>The review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the following criteria: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk. </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We characterised the methods used for blinding as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations): For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Selective reporting bias: For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Other sources of bias: For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.  </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Overall risk of bias [described in Table 8.5c in the Handbook] </LI>
</OL>
<P>We made explicit judgements regarding whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses (see 'Sensitivity analysis' below).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-26 21:29:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, only 74 preterm infants have been enrolled in trials of interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia and outcome data have been reported for 71 of these infants. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1999</LINK>) fulfilled all our inclusion criteria. We chose to include the other two studies as the populations were likely to be representative of infants with non-oliguric hyperkalaemia during the first few days of life. In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. In only one trial was a sample size calculation performed, but the study was terminated after only 22 of the 40 infants had been enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2002</LINK>). The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Malone-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1991</LINK>), 19 (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2002</LINK>) and 40 infants enrolled (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1999</LINK>). The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1991</LINK>). For some of the outcomes, there were discrepancies in statistical significance between the results for RR and RD. Thus, the results of these meta-analyses have to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose may provide benefits compared to rectal cation-resin (Kayexalate) with statistically significantly reduced RD or WMD for all cause mortality, treatment failure, duration of hyperkalaemia and IVH (grade &gt; 2). However, the RR was statistically reduced only for duration of hyperkalaemia and IVH. The results should be interpreted with caution as the statistical significance changed with the use of two different statistics (RR and RD). The results could be classified as of borderline statistical significance.</P>
<P>Albuterol inhalation when compared to placebo (saline inhalation), changed (decreased) serum K+ from baseline at four and eight hours after initiation of treatment.</P>
<P>No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation.</P>
<P>Other interventions listed in our objectives have not been studied to date. These include interventions aimed at increasing the elimination of potassium from the body (diuretics, exchange transfusion and peritoneal dialysis) and interventions aimed at counteracting potential arrhythmias from hyperkalaemia (calcium).</P>
<P>Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation appear to be promising interventions and deserve further study.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-26 13:25:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made. Until further evidence is ascertained from larger well designed and executed randomised controlled trials, it appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin intervention for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants.</P>

<P>Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study in well designed and executed randomised controlled trials. The two interventions could be tested against each other. Other interventions that have not been studied to date include interventions aimed at increasing the elimination of potassium from the body (diuretics, exchange transfusion and peritoneal dialysis) and interventions aimed at counteracting potential arrhythmias from hyperkalaemia (calcium).</P>

<P>Prakash Vemgal (PV) and Arne Ohlsson (AO) contributed equally to all sections of the protocol for this review. The literature search of databases was developed with the help of an experienced librarian. Both authors identified potentially eligible studies from the printouts and agreed on which trials to include. Quality assessments were conducted and data were abstracted by both authors independently and compared. One author (AO) entered the data into RevMan and the other author (PV) checked for accuracy. One author (AO) wrote the sections of the full review and the other author (PV) read and made changes. Changes were made by both authors following feedback from the editors of the review group.</P>
<P>The May 2011 update was conducted centrally by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group staff (Yolanda Montagne, Diane Haughton, and Roger Soll).  This update was reviewed and approved by PV and AO.</P>
