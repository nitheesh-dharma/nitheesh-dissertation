<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Bile acids may improve liver biochemistry of patients with hepatitis B or C, but there is insufficient evidence about long-term beneficial effects</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Viral hepatitis causes significant morbidity and mortality. Based on this Cochrane systematic review, bile acids may decrease serum transaminase activities in patients with acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, or chronic hepatitis C. However, bile acids have no effects in eradicating viral markers. There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute effects on the long-term outcomes that include hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and/or liver related mortality. </P>
<P>No clinical trials have evaluated bile acids for patients with hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. Accordingly, bile acids should first be evaluated in adequately sized and adequately conducted randomised trials before clinical use is considered.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Trials have assessed bile acids for patients with viral hepatitis, but no consensus has been reached regarding their usefulness.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were performed in <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (July 2007), <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2007), <I>MEDLINE</I> (July 2007), <I>EMBASE</I> (July 2007), Science Citation Index Expanded (July 2007), and <I>Chinese Biomedical Database</I> (July 2007). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of bile acids versus placebo or no intervention for viral hepatitis were included, irrespective of language, publication status, or blinding. Co-interventions were allowed in the included randomised clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors extracted the data independently. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated with respect to generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up. The outcomes were presented as relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 29 randomised trials of bile acids for hepatitis B or C; none were of high methodological quality. We were unable to extract data from two trials. In one trial, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) versus placebo for acute hepatitis B significantly reduced the risk of hepatitis B surface antigen positivity at the end of treatment and serum HBV DNA level at the end of follow-up. In another trial, UDCA versus no intervention for chronic hepatitis B significantly reduced the risk of having abnormal serum transaminase activities at the end of treatment. Twenty-five trials compared bile acids (21 trials UDCA; four trials tauro-UDCA) versus placebo or no intervention with or without co-interventions for chronic hepatitis C. Bile acids did not significantly reduce the risk of having detectable serum HCV RNA (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), cirrhosis, or portal and periportal inflammation score at the end of treatment. Bile acids significantly decreased the risk of having abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase activity at the end of treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90) and follow-up (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98). Bile acids significantly increased the Knodell score (WMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31) at the end of treatment. No severe adverse events were reported. We did not identify trials including patients with hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Bile acids lead to a significant improvement in serum transaminase activities in hepatitis B and C but have no effects on the clearance of virus. There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute effects on long-term outcomes including hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and liver related mortality. Randomised trials with high methodological quality are required before clinical use is considered.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:02:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Viral hepatitis is liver inflammation that can be caused by hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E virus (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfram 1999</LINK>). All of these viruses can cause an acute disease lasting several weeks including jaundice, dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Zuckermann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuckermann 1993</LINK>). After acute hepatitis, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis D virus (which can only infect patients already infected by hepatitis B virus) also cause chronic infection, which may develop into hepatic cirrhosis and/or liver cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fattovich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fattovich 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brechot-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brechot 1996</LINK>). Viral hepatitis is considered prevalent disease associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and socio-economic loss (<LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 1994</LINK>). It has been estimated that more than 350 million have chronic HBV infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000a</LINK>) and 170 million persons are chronically infected with HCV (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current treatment of acute viral hepatitis is based on supportive measures, relief of symptoms, and avoidance of further liver injury (<LINK REF="REF-Maddrey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddrey 1980</LINK>). At present, antiviral agents are not advocated for patients with typical acute viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 1995</LINK>) apart from the use of interferon for acute hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>). For chronic viral hepatitis, treatment recommendations vary with the viruses. Interferon or lamivudine are used for chronic hepatitis B (<LINK REF="REF-Liaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lok 2001</LINK>). Combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin is recommended for patients with chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Interferon can induce good biochemical responses in patients with chronic hepatitis D, but in the great majority of responders there is relapse after discontinuation of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfram 1999</LINK>). Interferon exerts a direct antiviral effect and enhances the immunomodulatory response of the host (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaw 1999</LINK>). Unfortunately, only a limited number of patients with chronic viral hepatitis are suitable for interferon therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002b</LINK>). Even the most effective therapy available, pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, leads to a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients with genotype 1 virus, the major genotype for chronic HCV in western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fried-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 2002</LINK>). New options to treat viral hepatitis have been explored and bile acids have been investigated for the possible effects on viral hepatitis. Moreover, treatment is costly and entails a high rate of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Renault-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renault 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Effective, well tolerated, and economic drugs for the treatment of viral hepatitis are needed.<BR/>
<BR/>Bile acids include chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (<LINK REF="REF-Fuchs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchs 1999</LINK>). In the course of cholestasis, intrahepatic accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid is thought to induce liver damage (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1972</LINK>) due to their detergent activity, which appears to dissolve phospholipid and cholesterol in cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Sholmerich-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sholmerich 1984</LINK>). The hepatocyte toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids has been observed both in animals and human beings (<LINK REF="REF-Jaeschke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeschke 2002</LINK>). These effects can be prevented by the addition of UDCA, which modifies the bile acid pool, resulting in an increase of the hydrophilic fraction, and stabilises cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1982</LINK>). The mechanisms of UDCA action include reduction of toxic endogenous bile acids, membrane stabilising activity, and an immunomodulatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>). Another bile acid, tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), has also been used for 'liver protection' (<LINK REF="REF-Podda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Podda 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>UDCA and TUDCA have been used for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>), primary sclerosis cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2002</LINK>), and other chronic cholestatic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Larghi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larghi 1997</LINK>). Several randomised clinical trials have shown that UDCA improves the serum biochemical indexes of cholestasis and cytolysis in patients with chronic liver diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>). Moreover, there is some evidence that UDCA, used alone or in combination with interferon, is able to improve liver enzyme levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1995</LINK>). TUDCA has physiochemical and metabolic properties, which favour its use as an alternative to UDCA for chronic cholestatic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 1993</LINK>). TUDCA may prove of benefit also for necroinflammatory liver diseases, especially for HCV-related chronic hepatitis in which bile duct damage is frequently seen (<LINK REF="REF-Fallon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallon 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane systematic review represents an update of our previous review, in which we found moderate beneficial effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis in trials with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives were to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis caused by one or more of the hepatotrophic viruses (A to E) based on the results of randomised clinical trials.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised clinical trials were included irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. Quasi-randomised trials (eg, using date of birth) and observational studies were excluded. However, for the evaluation of rare, serious adverse events, we also considered large cohort studies and previous meta-analyses/systematic reviews, as such events are rarely captured in randomised clinical trials due to their sample size.</P>

<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>The data were extracted by WC and JL independently. The data were validated by CG. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following characteristics were extracted from each trial: primary author, number of patients randomised, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, methodological quality, sample size calculation, intention-to-treat analysis, intervention regimens, mean age, proportion of males, proportion of patients with cholestasis, proportion of patients with cirrhosis, proportion of virus genotypes, number of outcomes, and number and type of adverse events in the intervention and the control group. Further information was sought by correspondence with the principal investigators of the included trials in case the relevant data were not published.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>The analyses were performed in Review Manager 4.1. The analyses for binary outcomes included all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up ('intention-to-treat') using the last reported observed response ('carry forward'). The analyses for continuous outcomes included only the patients with available data. We used both random-effects (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and fixed-effect models (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) in the meta-analyses. When we did not find a difference between the results of the two methods, we only reported the results of the fixed-effect model. Evidence of publication bias was analysed by funnel plot analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Binary outcome measures were analysed by relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcome measures by weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CI.</P>
<P>In our protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2001</LINK>), we planned to perform sensitivity analyses according to the (1) methodological quality of the included trials (adequate compared to inadequate); (2) dose and duration of treatment with bile acid; (3) treatment with or without co-intervention; and (4) publication status. The trials included in our review were of low methodological quality; the dosages of UDCA applied in the trials were in the range of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day; and we were unable to identify any unpublished trials. Accordingly, sensitivity analyses were only performed according to the duration of treatment with bile acids. The outcome measures used for sensitivity analyses were the risk of having serum HCV RNA at the end of follow-up and the risk of abnormal serum ALT at the end of treatment and follow-up.</P>
<P>We planned to do meta-regression if a sufficient number of trials were identified to explore the effect of patient characteristics, intervention regimens, and methodological quality of the trials on the virological response at the end of treatment. However, we decided not to perform such analyses due to the general low quality of the included trials in this review.</P>

<P>Our initial searches identified 174 studies; 154 from the electronic searches and 20 from the handsearches. After reading titles and abstracts, 124 of these articles were excluded because they were duplicates, non-clinical studies, or had study objectives different from our review. A total of 50 articles published in three languages (English, Chinese, and Italian) were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, 17 studies were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion are listed in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>The remaining 33 publications were randomised clinical trials that reported the random allocation of patients with viral hepatitis to bile acids versus control, including four double publications (<LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Puoti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Puoti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabbri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fabbri 2000</LINK>). Accordingly, the searches identified 29 trials that met all pre-specified inclusion criteria. These trials are listed in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. Twenty-four trials were published in English and five in Chinese. Ten trials were from Italy, five from China, five from Japan, four from France, two from Argentina, and one each from the Czech Republic, USA, and Turkey.</P>
<P>We were unable to supplement our electronic searches and handsearches with additional data from personal communications. Only one author replied and this author was not able to supply the information because the original data were lost. No responses were received from pharmaceutical companies (Axcan Pharma Inc and Dr. Falk Pharma).</P>
<P>
<B>Patients' origin and sample size</B>
<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Galsk_x00fd_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Galský 1999</LINK>) included in-patients, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Puoti-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Puoti 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdelmalek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelmalek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabbri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fabbri 2000</LINK>) included out-patients, and the other 25 trials did not specify the origin of the patients. The average size of the trial was 69 patients (range 31 to 167 patients).</P>
<P>
<B>Diagnoses</B>
<BR/>Inclusion criteria were explicit viral hepatitis diagnosed by virological markers, clinical manifestations, and biochemical variables. Thirteen trials confirmed the diagnosis by liver biopsy. Galský1999 included patients with acute hepatitis including A, B, and/or C. <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1995</LINK> included patients with chronic hepatitis B. Twenty-five trials included patients with chronic hepatitis C. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Qing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Qing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 2003</LINK>) included patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. We were unable to extract data on the respective diagnostic groups, nor did we receive a reply from the authors when requested for separate data on the patients with hepatitis B and C. Accordingly, outcome data from these two trials could not be included in this review. However, they are listed in the table 'Characteristics of included studies' and the section regarding the methodological quality of the included studies. No trials were found evaluating bile acids for hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, acute or chronic hepatitis D, or hepatitis E.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:02:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We identified only two trials evaluating UDCA for acute or chronic hepatitis B. However, we identified a large number of trials evaluating UDCA or TUDCA for chronic hepatitis C. We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trials evaluating bile acids for hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, acute or chronic hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. None of the included trials could be considered of high methodological quality with low risk of bias, ie, having adequate generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, the findings of our review must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the observed effects of bile acids were small and affected only surrogate outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). We have no evidence that these effects can be translated into meaningful clinical outcomes for patients. However, our findings suggest that UDCA may normalise or decrease serum transaminase activities in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. One single trial observed beneficial effects of UDCA on HBV markers in patients with acute hepatitis B. Further, a subgroup analysis of the trials evaluating long-term UDCA treatment of chronic hepatitis C suggested a beneficial effect on clearance of HCV RNA. However, we need large randomised clinical trials conducted with adequate methodology to confirm these observations. We were mostly unable to identify data on mortality, liver related morbidity (ie, hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease), quality of life, or cost-effectiveness. Bile acid treatment appeared safe; no serious adverse events were reported. Most of the adverse events which caused withdrawal of patients, such as depression, weight loss, and severe flu-like syndrome, probably arose from co-intervention with interferon (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Bile acids for hepatitis B</B>
<BR/>One trial in patients with acute hepatitis B reported that UDCA significantly reduced the risk of having positive HBsAg at the end of treatment (but not the end of follow-up) and significantly decreased HBV DNA levels at the end of follow-up (but not the end of treatment). This observation requires replication for several reasons. First, UDCA had no consistent effects on serum enzyme activities at the end of treatment or follow-up. Second, generation of the allocation sequence and allocation concealment were considered inadequate in this trial. Third, although the trial used placebo, we cannot be sure that this resulted in adequate blinding. Since trials involving bile acids may be difficult to blind sufficiently (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>), it cannot be excluded that the trial may have been biased. Therefore, the observations of Galský1999 need confirmation before any therapeutic recommendation can be made.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 1995</LINK>) compared UDCA versus no intervention for patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this trial, UDCA significantly decreased the risk of abnormal serum ALT and serum ALT activities at the end of treatment. However, the trial did not provide evidence for an effect of UDCA on serum viral markers or clinical or histological outcomes. Therefore, we also need more trials to investigate the effects of UDCA for chronic hepatitis B.</P>
<P>
<B>Bile acids for chronic hepatitis C</B>
<BR/>Overall, bile acids did not significantly affect the risk of being HCV RNA positive at the end of treatment or at the end of follow-up. In a sensitivity analysis considering treatment duration, bile acid treatment for 12 months or more was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of having HCV RNA at the end of follow-up, but not at the end of treatment. Before considering therapeutic actions based on this finding, one should consider the following. First, why should bile acids, which are quickly metabolised (<LINK REF="REF-Fuchs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchs 1999</LINK>), affect HCV RNA levels at the end of follow-up, but not at the end of treatment? Second, subgroup results, particularly when post hoc in nature, should be evaluated cautiously (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2000</LINK>). Third, due to the low methodological quality of the trials, significant overestimation of intervention effects cannot be excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Our observation should lead to proper assessment of bile acids in large scale randomised trials using adequate methods to control bias. The quest for such trials is further supported by the significant effects of bile acids on transaminase activities, whether analysed at the end of treatment or at the end of follow-up.</P>
<P>Although we observed significant effects of UDCA on biochemical variables such as ALT, AST, and GGT, we could not find evidence to prove that the improvement of these variables could be translated into meaningful improvement of clinical outcomes such as mortality, incidence of cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In clinical practice, some physicians continue to base therapeutic decisions on surrogate measures such as the biochemical variables mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). The results of our present review are comparable to two Cochrane systematic reviews on the effect of bile acids for primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, which reported significant improvement of biochemical variables, but not on 'hard' outcomes, such as mortality and liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>). A new trial to investigate the effects of UDCA on meaningful clinical outcomes seems to be needed. Quality of life is another very important aspect that needs to be studied in patients with viral hepatitis. None of the included trials in our review assessed quality of life specifically.</P>
<P>Chronic hepatitis C infection can be characterised by histological changes, which run from relatively mild hepatic inflammatory activity and a low degree of fibrosis to full blown cirrhosis with liver failure. Hepatic lesions may be accompanied by bile duct damage, intraportal lymphoid aggregates, steatosis, or a combination of these manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Mihm-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihm 1997</LINK>). The pathological changes of the bile duct system caused by viral hepatitis contribute the formation of cholangitis and accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 2000</LINK>). Therefore, one possible explanation for the liver biochemistry improvement obtained by administering UDCA would be that it replaces the more hydrophobic human bile acids, which cause liver cell damage (<LINK REF="REF-Batta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batta 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chretien-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chretien 1989</LINK>). The protection of UDCA may also result from stimulation of hepato-biliary secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, recent data from basic research demonstrate that bile acids, including UDCA, appear to affect both 'death receptors' (Caspase 8/10) and 'cell survival cascades' (UDCA-epidermal growth factor-mitogen activated protein kinase) (<LINK REF="REF-Guicciardi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guicciardi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiao 2002</LINK>). The beneficial effects of UDCA on liver biochemistry variables suggest that in patients with viral hepatitis (the present review), primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>), UDCA's stimulus of the 'cell survival cascades' seems to overpower UDCA's stimulus of the cell 'death receptors'. However, beneficially affecting cell death of, for example hepatocytes, may not be important enough to arrest or slow down the progression of these liver diseases. From the meta-analyses in our review, we observed that UDCA did have significant effects on improving the biochemical variables such as ALT, AST and GGT, which may result from the mechanisms of UDCA mentioned above. However, in this present review and another review on UDCA for primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>), we found that bile acids may worsen liver histology. More evidence regarding this finding is needed.</P>
<P>As indicated, the reported methodological quality of the reviewed trials was low and in some trials we had difficulties extracting the relevant data. In order to get detailed data on the trials, 17 letters were sent to the first authors. Only one author replied and this author could not supply the information because the original data were lost. In the future, trials ought to report more fully on clinically relevant outcomes and follow recommended guidelines for the reporting of trials (CONSORT - Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials: www.consort-statement.org).</P>
<P>We did not observe any therapeutic advantage of using TUDCA instead of UDCA. We therefore advocate that UDCA should be the bile acid being evaluated for patients with viral hepatitis, as this bile acid has been most widely used. Accordingly, we know the adverse event profile of this bile acid best. If it turns out to be possible to demonstrate beneficial clinical effects with UDCA, it may then become worthwhile considering 'head-to-head' comparisons of UDCA versus TUDCA in randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>UDCA is still being used for primary biliary cirrhosis, although the evidence for its clinical effects have been questioned in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>) and in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>). In primary biliary cirrhosis, UDCA compared to placebo/no intervention leads to a decrease in serum bilirubin of about 10 µmol/L and a decrease of serum ALT of about 48 IU/L (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>). These decreases are similar to those observed in the present review in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C considering the dosage administered and the duration of treatment. Bile acids do not seem to differ regarding the lack of significant clinical effects in both primary biliary cirrhosis and viral hepatitis. It is, therefore, a question why we as clinicians are not more consistent as UDCA is often used for primary biliary cirrhosis and it is very seldom that UDCA (or other bile acids) are used for viral hepatitis.</P>
<P>This review demonstrates the necessity to search for trials in databases that are not normally included in Cochrane Reviews and other reviews. We identified five Chinese trials by searching the Chinese Biomedical Database. Although the methodological quality of Chinese clinical trials is generally low (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>), the rising activity in performing randomised clinical trials in China must be considered in the West.</P>
<P>In the above meta-analyses we have disregarded the risks of random errors in meta-analysis. Evidence shows that much errors may be substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2007</LINK>). If these risks were taken properly into consideration, several of our significant findings are likely to come out insignificant (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2007</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is not significant evidence to support or refute beneficial effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis. UDCA or TUDCA may improve liver transaminase activities, but there is no compelling evidence showing that these bile acids beneficially affect viral markers, mortality, cirrhosis development, need for liver transplantation, or liver histology in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. We have no knowledge about the potential beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>
<B>Acute hepatitis B</B>
<BR/>Due to the potential beneficial effect of UDCA on viral markers in acute hepatitis B, it seems worthwhile to test this in randomised placebo controlled clinical trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up after the end of treatment. If such trials should show positive results, further trials addressing clinical effects seem warranted.</P>
<P>
<B>Chronic hepatitis B</B>
<BR/>Due to the potential beneficial effect of UDCA on viral markers in acute hepatitis B and on liver biochemistry in chronic hepatitis B, it seems worthwhile to test if similar effects could be observed in chronic hepatitis B patients included in randomised placebo controlled clinical trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up after the end of treatment. Co-intervention in both arms of the trial could be used. If such trials should show positive results on viral markers, further trials addressing clinical effects seem warranted.</P>
<P>
<B>Chronic hepatitis C</B>
<BR/>Due to the potential beneficial effect of bile acids on viral markers in chronic hepatitis C with co-intervention of interferon, it seems worthwhile to test this potential effect in randomised placebo controlled clinical trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up after the end of treatment. Co-intervention in both arms of the trial could be pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. If such trials should show positive results, further trials addressing clinical effects seem warranted. </P>
<P>
<B>Other types of viral hepatitis </B>
<BR/>We suggest that trials on bile acids for other forms of viral hepatitis should await the results of trials demonstrating clear virological and/or clinical effects of bile acids for patients with hepatitis B and/or C.</P>
<P>
<B>General aspects</B>
<BR/>We do not have any data examining the potential advantage of using TUDCA instead of UDCA. However, before such 'head-to-head' comparative trials are considered, the beneficial clinical effects of UDCA ought to be established.</P>
<P>Researchers wishing to examine the effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis ought to use adequate trial methodology and follow the guidelines for reporting of trials (CONSORT - Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials: www.consort-statement.org).</P>
<P>Detrimental effect of bile acids on liver histology cannot be excluded. Therefore, an independent Data Monitoring and Safety Committee should effectively monitor such trials, including the results of liver histology.</P>

<P>According to the advice from the latest workshop on how to edit systematic reviews, we performed the following change in this review.</P>
<P>We used both a random-effects (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and fixed effect-model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) in the meta-analysis. We reported the results of the fixed-effect model if there was no difference in the results of the two models. Otherwise, we would have reported the results produced by both models.</P>
