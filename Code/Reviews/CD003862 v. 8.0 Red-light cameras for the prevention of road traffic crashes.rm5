<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-11 21:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Road crashes are a leading cause of death and injury. One common place for these to happen is at junctions (intersections) controlled by traffic signals. 'Red-light cameras' are now widely used to identify drivers that jump ('run') red lights, who can then be prosecuted. This review looked for studies of their effectiveness in reducing the number of times that drivers drive through red lights and the number of crashes. Very little research has been done and much of it has not allowed for the statistical problems that occur when recording this kind of information. However, five studies in Australia, Singapore and the USA all found that use of red-light cameras cut the number of crashes in which there were injuries. In the best conducted of these studies, the reduction was nearly 30%. More research is needed to determine best practice for red-light camera programmes, including how camera sites are selected, signing policies, publicity programmes and penalties.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Road crashes are a prime cause of death and disability and red-light running is a common cause of crashes at signalised intersections. Red-light cameras are increasingly used to promote compliance with traffic signals. Manual enforcement methods are resource intensive and high risk, whereas red-light cameras can operate 24 hours a day and do not involve high-speed pursuits.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the impact of red-light cameras on the incidence and severity of road crashes and casualties, and the incidence of red-light violations. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: TRANSPORT (NTIS, TRIS, IRRD,TRANSDOC), Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Australian Transport Index. We checked the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted research and advocacy organisations.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-controlled trials and controlled before-after studies of red-light cameras. For crash impact evaluation, the before and after periods each had to be at least one year in length. For violation studies, the after period had to occur at least one year after camera installation. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data on study type, characteristics of camera and control areas, and data collection period. Before-after data were collected on number of crashes by severity, collision type, deaths and injuries, and red-light violations. Rate ratio was calculated for each study. Where there was more than one, rate ratios were pooled to give an overall estimate, using a generic inverse variance method and a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No randomised controlled trials were identified but 10 controlled before-after studies from Australia, Singapore and the USA met our inclusion criteria. We grouped them according to the extent to which they adjusted for regression to the mean (RTM) and spillover effects. <I>Total casualty crashes: </I>the only study that adjusted for both reported a rate ratio of 0.71 (95% CI to 0.55, 0.93); for three that partially adjusted for RTM but failed to consider spillover, rate ratio was 0.87 (95% CI to 0.77, 0.98); one that made no adjustments had a rate ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.12). <I>Right-angle casualty crashes</I>: rate ratio for two studies that partially addressed RTM was 0.76 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.07).<I> Total crashes</I>: the study addressing both RTM and spillover reported a rate ratio of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.05); one study that partially addressed RTM had a rate ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.15); the pooled rate ratio from the five studies with no adjustments was 0.74 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.03). <I>Red-light violations</I>: one study found a rate ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.66).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Red-light cameras are effective in reducing total casualty crashes. The evidence is less conclusive on total collisions, specific casualty collision types and violations, where reductions achieved could be explained by the play of chance. Most evaluations did not adjust for RTM or spillover, affecting their accuracy. Larger and better controlled studies are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-14 15:58:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Road crashes are a leading cause of death and disability. The most common victim is a man in the prime of life, most likely with family dependants. Road deaths and injuries are expected to increase for at least the next two decades and, by 2020, road traffic injury is predicted to become the third greatest cause of death and disability in the world. Traffic injury will then follow heart disease and depression &#8722; conditions as slow in their development as injury is sudden (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Motorisation is increasing even faster than road death and injury (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2000</LINK>). Many low-income countries have experienced rapid growth in their motor vehicle fleet, especially in motorcycles, the most vulnerable of all motorised modes. With motorisation comes the need for traffic control and signalisation of junctions. Drivers running ('jumping') red lights are a leading cause of crashes at signalised junctions. While most of these crashes are 'damage only', many can be serious, as speed and side impacts are often involved (<LINK REF="REF-TRB-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRB 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Red-light cameras are increasingly used to enforce compliance with traffic signals. Traditional manual enforcement methods are both resource intensive and high risk, whereas red-light cameras have the advantage of operating 24 hours a day and do not involve high-speed pursuits. Red-light cameras, unlike the police, are also immune from charges of discrimination, as they detect only those vehicles that have violated a traffic signal. The prevention of right-angle collisions is regarded as the prime target in red-light cameras programmes, as other crashes (i.e. rear-end collisions) carry a lower risk of causing serious injury. </P>
<P>Red-light cameras have been in use since the early 1970s and much has been written on their operation. Nevertheless, several recent syntheses and meta-analyses of red-light camera programmes have commented on the methodological weaknesses of the evaluations of their effectiveness that have so far been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-ICBC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICBC 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-TRB-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRB 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Retting-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Retting 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Flannery-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flannery 2002</LINK>). This review analyses the evidence available on the safety benefits of red-light cameras. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the impact of red-light cameras on the incidence and severity of road crashes and casualties, as well as on the incidence of red-light violations. </P>

<P>The included studies were assessed on whether they had adjusted for two key and common weaknesses: regression to the mean (RTM) and spillover effects.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>RTM is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when there is non-random, biased selection of sites. As most safety engineering remedial measures are introduced at sites with the highest number of collisions, these locations can be expected to experience lower collision rates in the after period, even without the introduction of a safety measure, due to the natural tendency to regress towards the mean. RTM can be avoided by using a randomised trial or adjusted for with a statistical method, e.g. the empirical Bayesian method.</LI>
<LI>As red-light camera programmes involve publicity campaigns and warning signs, behaviour in general may be influenced, with drivers inclined to obey red lights at all signalised junctions thus reducing the risk of collisions at non-camera sites. To control for this spillover effect, control sites should be located away from red-light camera sites and the associated publicity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Three basic categories were used: adjusted studies that addressed both RTM and spillover effects; partially adjusted studies that addressed RTM but not spillover effects; and the remaining studies that did not adjust for either of these factors.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-09-11 21:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A weighted intervention effect was calculated across trials, using the statistical facility in Cochrane's RevMan software. The results for dichotomous outcomes were expressed as rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The rate ratio is the ratio of event rates post and pre-intervention in the intervention area divided by the corresponding post to pre-intervention ratio in the control area. Assuming that any changes to the population at risk in the intervention area is the same as that in the control area, the rate ratio shows the reduction in the incidence rate in the intervention area to that predicted from the rates in the control area. Thus a rate ratio of 0.7 indicates a 30% reduction in events compared to that predicted from the rates in the control area.</P>
<P>Standard errors for logarithms of rate ratios, and hence 95% CIs for rate ratios, were calculated assuming that the number of events in each area in each period followed a Poisson distribution. The generic inverse variance method was used with a random effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using a chi-squared test; there was considered to be significant heterogeneity when P was less than or equal to 0.05.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The initial searching identified 599 published articles but not all referred to red-light cameras for traffic enforcement. After further screening, 30 studies were considered in detail but 20 were subsequently excluded. No randomised controlled trials were found but there were 10 controlled before-after studies that met the inclusion criteria. </P>
<P>Despite the increasing use of red-light cameras, very few controlled before-after evaluations of red-light cameras were identified. There were, for example, none from the UK, where red-light cameras were introduced in 1991. The first four studies were from Australia and Singapore. The first three were in Australia (1988 to 1994) and involved the rotation of red-light cameras among camera sites (<LINK REF="STD-South-Melbourne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">South Melbourne 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillier-Sydney-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hillier Sydney 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-Adelaide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mann Adelaide 1994</LINK>). The Singapore study evaluated fixed red-light cameras, with some of the junctions having cameras assigned to multiple approaches (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-Singapore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ng Singapore 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>After 1997, the only studies found were from the US, where red-light cameras were first introduced in 1993. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Retting-Fairfax-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Retting Fairfax 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Retting-Oxnard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Retting Oxnard 2002</LINK>) included a comparison with non-cameras sites within the same locality, as well as a comparison with other nearby cities that did not have red-light cameras. The California Bureau of State Audit recently reviewed red-light camera programmes and compared red-light camera junctions to all other intersections within the locality (<LINK REF="STD-CA-SA-LA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CA SA LA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-SA-Oxnard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CA SA Oxnard 2002</LINK>; CA SA S'mento 2002; <LINK REF="STD-CA-SA-San-Diego-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CA SA San Diego 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Nine studies evaluated the impact on crashes, while one reported red-light violations (<LINK REF="STD-Retting-Fairfax-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Retting Fairfax 1999</LINK>). Crash statistics were collected from official databases based on police reports, while violations were monitored by video camera and red-light camera. No studies reported on fatal or serious injury collisions but five studies investigated the effect on total casualty crashes (<LINK REF="STD-South-Melbourne-1988" TYPE="STUDY">South Melbourne 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillier-Sydney-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hillier Sydney 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-Adelaide-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mann Adelaide 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-Singapore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ng Singapore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Retting-Oxnard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Retting Oxnard 2002</LINK>), which include fatal, serious and slight injury crashes. </P>

<BR/>A controlled before-after study in Oxnard, California, USA of the impact of red-light cameras on road crashes, where four red-light cameras were rotated on single approaches at 11 of the 125 signalised intersections. The before period of 29 months and an after period of 20 months were separated by a two-month gap. Camera sites were chosen on the basis of red-light related crash data, technical suitability, and informal input. The impact was measured in terms of all signalised junctions in Oxnard, which avoided the problem of RTM. Comparison was made with the non-signalised junctions in Oxnard and three other cities in California of varying proximity (one 40 miles and two 100 miles away) in order to adjust for any spillover effect. These cities all had approximately the same number of crashes as did Oxnard. Results were reported on total crashes (including property damage) and total casualty crashes at both signalised and non-signalised junctions, excluding those intersections that were signalised during the survey period.</P>

<BR/>A controlled before-after study conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with a three-year before and three-year after period. The worst 100 signalised junctions (in terms of total right-angle and right-angle casualty crashes during 1977 to 1981) were divided into treatment and control sites. Camera and control sites were alternated on major roads. Adjacent intersections were not included in the trial and sites were allocated so that, where possible, treatment sites were located next to control sites. Control sites were chosen to be as similar as possible, in terms of high collision rates, speed limits and junction configuration, (e.g. single-lane and double-lane approaches, intersections with medians, tram lines, different speed limits). While all camera sites had warning signs posted, only a minority were active at any one time with between seven and ten red-light cameras rotated among the 46 camera sites. Results were reported separately on casualty crashes (including total, right-angle, rear-end, right-angle turning, right-against, and rear-end turning) and total casualties.</P>

<BR/>A controlled before-after study in Sydney, Australia with a two-year before and two-year after period, separated by a gap of 18 months. Camera sites (16) were allocated into two groups: 'most-used' and 'least-used', according to the amount of red-light camera allocation time. Little information was provided on the rotation of the six cameras used. All camera sites were signed. Two control groups were chosen on the basis of crash history, traffic volume and junction configuration, although the least used control site group was dropped after it received other interventions. Results were reported separately for casualty and total crashes, including damage-only (total, right-angle, rear-end), as well as for fatal and injury crashes.</P>

<BR/>A controlled before-after study in Singapore, where 42 camera junctions were compared with 42 control junctions. A three-year before and a three-year after period were used. Camera sites were chosen on the basis of the incidence of high occurrence of collisions and/or violations, hazards from heavy traffic flows, and complaints by pedestrians. Warning signs were installed at camera sites. Singapore has a high number of red-light cameras with cameras at one-fifth of all signalised junctions. Some junctions had cameras on as many as three approaches. Control sites were selected on the basis of a high collision record and similar layout. Difficulties in identifying control sites were reported. Traffic volumes and mixes were assumed to be similar and so were not taken into consideration. Results were presented on casualty crashes only (total, right-angle, rear-end, head-on/sideswipe and other crashes).</P>

<BR/>A controlled before-after study in Fairfax, Virginia, USA of the impact on red-light violations by five (single-approach) red-light cameras. The before survey was conducted immediately before the red-light camera warning period. After surveys were taken three and 12 months afterwards (daytime hours only at control sites). The number of exposure hours in each of the before-after periods ranged from 113 to 117 hours for the camera sites and 71 to 72 hours for the control sites outside of Fairfax. Camera sites were selected on the basis of collision history, and included three cameras installed in 1997 and two in 1998. Control sites were chosen both within Fairfax and in near-by counties, to control for such factors as weather, seasonal variability, traffic pattern and a spillover effect. The comparison between Fairfax and the nearby counties is reported in this review.</P>

</B>A controlled before-after study in Adelaide, Australia with five red-light cameras rotated amongst 15 junctions, chosen on the basis of their crash record and high traffic flows. Control sites included 14 signalised junctions, selected on the basis of high traffic volumes, similar geometrics, and a similar share of inner city sites. The before and after periods were five years each. Warning signs were posted at all approaches to camera junctions and the amber phase was increased from three to four seconds at the start of the red-light camera programme. Results were reported separately for casualty and property damage-only collisions (total, right-angle, rear-end and right-turn crashes).</P>
<P>The following four studies were all reported in a recent California State Audit Bureau report. As required by state law, all red-light camera sites had to have a public hearing, public notice and 30-day warning period before camera enforcement began. California is also the only US state where running a red light is a criminal offence instead of a civil offence.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Red-light cameras have been shown to be effective in reducing total casualty crashes. The strongest evidence comes from a study that used gateway signing and did not install warning notices at camera sites, and whose evaluation included a comparison with nearby cities in order to adjust for spillover effects. This was the only study that accounted for both regression to mean and spillover effects.</P>
<P>The limited evidence available is less conclusive as to whether red-light cameras are able to reduce right-angle or rear-end casualty crashes or total crashes (including property damage only crashes) and traffic violations. The pooled rate ratios show that an overall reduction was achieved in these studies but the confidence intervals include the value 1.0, so the result could be explained by the play of chance. This is partially due to sample size as seen with the findings for total casualty crashes, where the pooled rate ratio of the three partially adjusted studies was reduced to 0.98. A meta-analysis is useful for comparing 'like with like' and, while the study findings for the three groups have been reported and thus can be compared, they have not been pooled to produce an overall estimate.</P>
<P>Although red-light cameras have been used for over 20 years, there have been very few studies meeting our inclusion criteria and the majority of these suffered from lack of adjustment for regression to mean and spillover effects. Included studies came from only three countries none of them in Europe, where red-light cameras have been used extensively. The most recent seven studies were from the US, six of which reported on total collisions only. This limits the strength as well as the transferability of the findings. Red-light cameras are beginning to be introduced in middle and low-income countries. The findings of studies from high-income countries cannot be assumed to apply to low and middle-income countries, especially as vehicle registration systems will be less developed, and owners and drivers less likely to be identified and have sanctions imposed.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews have reported the difficulty of identifying intervention evaluations in road safety. The same problem was encountered in conducting this review. Many of the included studies, even those several years old, came from websites and from reading related material, and not from the literature search of the transport and public health databases. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results show red-light cameras are effective in reducing total casualty crashes at signalised intersections. Policies on warning signs and camera site selection should aim to maximise the casualty reduction impact, including that at nearby non-camera sites, which may benefit from spillover effects.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Only ten evaluations met the inclusion criteria and their results were limited by methodological weaknesses with insufficient adjustment for regression to mean and spillover. Trials are needed which account for both these key factors and evaluate the impact of different signing policies (camera site specific or gateway approaches) and camera site selections (hazardous locations only or other concerns including geographic dispersion). Red-light camera approval procedures should also include proper monitoring and evaluation requirements.</P>
