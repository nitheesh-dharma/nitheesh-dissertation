<P>Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhoea) are caused by cramps in the uterus (womb). One of the non-drug options for dysmenorrhoea is spinal manipulation (using the hands to put pressure on certain parts of the back bone). This procedure is sometimes offered by physiotherapists, osteopaths or chiropractors. As dysmenorrhoea may be caused by restricted blood flow, manipulating the lower spine could improve blood flow to the pelvic area. The review of trials found no evidence that spinal manipulation relieves dysmenorrhoea.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-23 15:45:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea (occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin) is a common gynaecological condition. The character of pain from musculoskeletal dysfunction can be very similar to gynaecological pain by presenting cyclicly and being altered by hormonal changes associated with menstruation. Medical treatment for dysmenorrhoea usually comprises anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, or surgical intervention. Spinal manipulation is a non-medical intervention. It has been suggested that manipulation of the vertebrae may increase spinal mobility thus improving pelvic blood supply and facilitating pain relief.</P>

<P>Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including spinal manipulative interventions (for example chiropractic, osteopathy, or manipulative physiotherapy) versus each other, placebo, no treatment, or another medical treatment were considered.

<P>Two trials of high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation and one trial of the Toftness technique were included.

<P>Results from HVLA manipulation suggested that the technique was no more effective than sham manipulation for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. One small trial indicated a difference in favour of HVLA manipulation however the one trial with an adequate sample size found no difference between HVLA and sham manipulation. There was no difference in adverse effects. The Toftness technique appeared more effective than sham treatment in one small trial but no conclusions could be made due to the size and other methodological limitations of the trial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-23 16:27:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-23 16:12:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin. It is a common gynaecological condition that can affect as many as 50% of women, 10% of these women suffer severely enough to render them incapacitated for one to three days each menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1990</LINK>). This situation not only has a significant affect on quality of life and personal health but also has a global economic impact. In the US alone it is estimated that the annual economic loss is 600 million work hours and two billion dollars (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is commonly defined under two subcategories. When the pelvic pain is associated with an identifiable pathological condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts, it is considered to be secondary dysmenorrhoea. In contrast, menstrual pain without organic pathology is considered to be primary dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Lichten-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichten 1987</LINK>). The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhoea is usually at or shortly after (six to 12 months) menarche, when ovulatory cycles are established. The pain duration is commonly eight to 72 hours and is typically associated with the onset of menstrual flow. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhoea is more likely to occur years after the onset of menarche and can occur premenstrually as well as during menstruation.</P>
<P>There are many methodological problems associated with quantifying and grading the pain of dysmenorrhoea. Assessment instruments used in quantifying dysmenorrhoea are based on women's self reporting, which may be subject to bias. Simple numerical rating scales (that is, one to five) or verbal rating scales (that is, mild, moderate, or severe) are common tools in rating pain such as with dysmenorrhoea. A similar tool that is more sensitive is the visual analogue scale (VAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Huskisson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huskisson 1983</LINK>). The VAS is a commonly used scale in pain assessment due to its simplicity and reliability; however, it is only a uni-dimensional measure and is, therefore, limited in application (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1994</LINK>). Multi-dimensional scales such as the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Moos-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moos 1968</LINK>) and the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Chesney-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesney 1975</LINK>) have also been developed; however, both have been criticised for being based on unrepresentative samples and for problems with validity (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1983</LINK>83). Generally speaking, if a woman seeks relief from pain a diagnosis of dysmenorrhoea may be justified regardless of the grading system used to assess her level of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ylikorkala-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylikorkala 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea has been the source of considerable debate and is still not completely certain. Experimental and clinical research has identified the overproduction of uterine prostaglandins as a substantial contributing factor to the painful cramps that are the major symptom of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenwaks-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenwaks 1980</LINK>). Overproduction of vasopressin, a hormone that stimulates contraction of muscular tissue, has also been identified as a contributing factor to dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Stromberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stromberg 1984</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-09-23 16:20:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are common therapies for dysmenorrhoea as they both act by reducing myometrial activity. Surgical interruption of the sympathetic pelvic nerve pathways is also used as treatment to diminish uterine pain (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1990</LINK>). The efficacy of conventional treatments such as NSAIDs is considerable however the failure rate can still be as high as 20% to 25%, and there are also a number of associated adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henzl-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzl 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many women seek alternatives to conventional medical treatments. The use of complementary or alternative therapy has become popular with both consumers and mainstream medical practitioners. Their definition is deliberately broad as what are considered complementary practices in one country could be conventional therapies in another. Studies suggest that between 30% to 50% of the adult population in industrialised nations use some form of complementary therapy to prevent or treat health-related problems (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physical or manipulative treatments have some of the highest rates of physician referral and practice among the many forms of complementary therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 1998a</LINK>). One popular treatment modality is spinal manipulation therapy. There is controversy about its use to treat visceral conditions (conditions related to the internal organs) such as dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Jamison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamison 1992</LINK>). A case study of treatment with spinal manipulation has demonstrated effective management of dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Liebl-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebl 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Toftness technique is a 'low-force' chiropractic technique. The basic premise is that the nervous system has an electromagnetic energy associated with normal function. When the nervous system is not functioning normally, that is when there is a subluxation, the electromagnetic energy is abnormal. The chiropractor aims to identify the subluxation and remove it through adjustment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-09-23 16:26:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several rationales for the use of musculoskeletal manipulation to treat dysmenorrhoea. The parasympathetic and sympathetic pelvic nerve pathways are closely associated with the spinal vertebrae, in particular the second to fourth sacral segments and the 10th thoracic to the second lumbar segments (<LINK REF="REF-Jamison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamison 1992</LINK>). One hypothesis is that mechanical dysfunction in these vertebrae causes decreased spinal mobility. This could affect the sympathetic nerve supply to the blood vessels supplying the pelvic viscera (internal organs) leading to dysmenorrhoea as a result of vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels). Manipulation of these vertebrae increases spinal mobility and may improve pelvic blood supply through an influence on the autonomic nerve supply to the blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Hitchcock-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hitchcock 1976</LINK>). Another hypothesis is that dysmenorrhoea is referred pain arising from musculoskeletal structures that share the same pelvic nerve pathways. Referred pain from the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hips may be responsible for the pelvic pain and other symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea; vertebrae, joint capsules, ligaments, discs and muscle groups are all structures supplied by the pelvic nerve roots (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1993</LINK>). The character of pain from musculoskeletal dysfunction can be very similar to gynaecological pain and can present as cyclic pain as it can also be altered by hormonal influences and the changes associated with menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The value of any treatment is also dependent on the possible adverse effects associated with the treatment. Severe adverse reactions including death and paralysis can occur with spinal manipulation (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 1996</LINK>) however these extreme effects are usually related to cervical spinal manipulation and occur at the rate of one in one million cervical spine manipulations (<LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 1996</LINK>). Manipulation of the lower spine, the area that would commonly be targeted in dysmenorrhoea, is associated with much lower risks; fractures and cauda equina syndrome (nerve compression) are the most serious reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 1996</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-09-23 16:27:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Perceived efficacy is the most salient factor in a person's decision to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as spinal manipulation, yet this efficacy is usually based on word of mouth or single case studies (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 1998b</LINK>). This systematic review aims to compare all randomised controlled trials of spinal manipulative interventions as treatment for dysmenorrhoea to determine their safety and efficacy.</P>

<P>The main planned analyses were comparisons between different types of spinal manipulation; spinal manipulation versus placebo, control, or no treatment; and spinal manipulation versus other medical treatments. It was later decided to evaluate the data from different manipulative techniques separately as the authors deemed it inappropriate to combine data when treatments were dramatically different. One included trial used the Toftness technique as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1996</LINK>). This technique was considerably different from the high velocity, low amplitude manipulative techniques used in the other three trials, therefore the two treatments were considered separately in the analysis.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. It was the intention of the review authors to pool the outcomes, where possible. Due to the lack of trials no data were pooled. For dichotomous data (that is, outcomes that are either present or not, such as pain relief) the data were summarised as the number of people who experienced the event or outcome in each comparison group and the total number in each group.</P>
<P>For continuous data (for example, pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS)) the data were summarised as the number of people in each group, the mean value for the outcome in each group and the standard deviation for each mean. No meta-analysis could be conducted as there was only one trial for each outcome.</P>
<P>For one study, standard errors were converted to standard deviations (standard error x square root of n (where n = group sample size)) for the outcome of mean change from baseline for 100 mm VAS pain scores so that a mean difference (MD) could be calculated (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>). </P>

<P>Three trials followed a strict parallel-group design in which one group received manipulative treatment and the other group a sham or control treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the trials took place in chiropractic and osteopathic clinics and all were performed in the United States. Two studies mentioned the source of their participants: two used local advertisements (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>), and one also used referrals from practitioners (chiropractors) or gynaecologists (<LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included participants in the trials had dysmenorrhoea. The trialist's specifically mentioned primary dysmenorrhoea in addition to the exclusion of pelvic pathology (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1996</LINK>). One trial mentioned the use of both a gynaecological and chiropractic examination to confirm the diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>). Common exclusion criteria were pre-existing back trauma or pain, pelvic abnormality or pathology, and the use of an IUD or oral contraceptives. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 45 years.</P>
<P>Two of the included trials used similar high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) rotation manipulation techniques. These treatments involved multiple level manipulations in the sideline position with joints manipulated in the physiological end range (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>). One trial used a very different technique, the Toftness system, which involved a sensometer and spinal adjustment using a hand pressure applicator (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1996</LINK>). The trials compared the manipulative treatment to some type of sham manipulative procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1996</LINK>).</P>

<I>Treatment</I>: following pretreatment with superficial effleurage (massage) for three to five minutes, spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) using high velocity, short-lever, low amplitude (greater than 750 N) thrust to vertebral levels from the 10th thoracic vertebrae to the fifth lumbar vertebrae (T10 to L5) and the sacroiliac joints (the joints between the hip and sacrum). Participants were positioned lying on their side with their bottom leg straight and their top hip and leg flexed.<BR/>
<I>Control</I>: a low-force mimic (LFM) manoeuvre intended as a sham procedure as it appeared very similar to SMT. Sham manipulation was delivered to the left lumbar second to third vertebral level. A high velocity, short-lever, low amplitude thrust (of not more than 400 N) was administered however the posture of the participant (both hips and both knees flexed) was such that the mechanical effect of the manipulation was substantially reduced.<BR/>
<I>Duration and timing</I>: cycle one was the baseline; treatment was performed on day one of cycle two for one treatment; three treatments were performed seven to 10 days preceding menses for cycles three and four, treatment was also performed on the first day of menses in cycles three and four.</P>

<I>Treatment</I>: high velocity, low amplitude manipulation to clinically relevant vertebral levels from the 10th thoracic vertebrae to the fifth lumbar vertebrae, the sacral curve (T10 to L5-S1) and the sacroiliac joints (the joints between the hip and sacrum). Participants were positioned lying on their side with their bottom leg straight and their top hip and leg flexed.<BR/>
<I>Control</I>: sham manipulation to midline base of the sacrum. A high velocity, short-lever, low amplitude thrust was administered however the posture of the participant (with both hips and knees flexed), the offsetting of the leg movement to the thrust, and the midrange position of the joint was such that the mechanical torque of the manipulation was substantially reduced.<BR/>

<I>Treatment</I>: Toftness system of chiropractic adjusting, a low force technique which uses a sensometer to detect abnormal electromagnetic radiation to determine which sites to adjust. Adjustment was delivered using a metered, hand-held pressure applicator.<BR/>
<I>Control</I>: used the same basic procedure as the treatment group however adjustments were made at sites distinct from sites identified by the sensometer, otherwise the same contact and amount of force was used.<BR/>
<I>Duration</I>: three consecutive cycles, adjustments began on day one of menstrual flow and were received daily until the last day of menstrual flow. No more than 27 adjustments were allowed in the 90-day treatment period. Women were monitored for three months after treatment.

<BR/>Four chiropractic doctors delivered the majority of treatments, however a total of 14 clinicians delivered treatments. Initially all clinicians were trained in both procedures and retraining occurred at regular intervals throughout the study although how often was not specified. The sham treatment used was a very similar procedure to the experimental treatment and all other factors of the procedure were kept consistent (the only difference was posture and the force applied). The authors suggested that their sham procedure may have been too similar to the treatment to elicit an adequate comparison. Overall, the consistency of treatment appeared adequate however the number of clinicians delivering treatments seems high.</P>

<BR/>All participants were treated only once, on day one of their cycle. No information was presented regarding consistency of treatment. The trial reported that the clinically relevant vertebral levels would be manipulated; however, no information was presented on how this differed among participants. The measurement of outcomes occurred directly after treatment, therefore, no information was reported on whether the treatment effects lasted longer than one hour post-treatment. The sham treatment used was the same as that used in the Hondras trial and appeared to be adequate. This sham treatment was perhaps too similar to the manipulative treatment and the amount of force used may still have had a therapeutic effect.</P>

<B>High velocity, low amplitude spinal manipulation</B>
<BR/>Two of the included trials used high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation as treatment. The outcome of pain intensity or pain relief was reported in a different way by each of the trials therefore it was not possible to combine the results of the trials. One small trial comparing HVLA manipulation with sham treatment (n = 44) expressed pain as a 10 cm VAS pain intensity score (with high scores representing more pain) after one treatment and one cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>). This trial indicated a significant difference between active and sham treatment in favour of HVLA manipulation (MD -1.41, 95% CI -2.55 to -0.27). The second trial (n = 137) reported pain data as the mean change in 100 mm VAS pain scores from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-09-23 22:45:33 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of spinal manipulation for the treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea. Despite the popularity of complementary therapies, especially chiropractic treatment, there is a general lack of well-designed research to evaluate the effectiveness of manipulation for specific conditions.</P>
<P>Three trials of spinal manipulation were identified. High velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation, a common manipulative technique, was the subject of two trials with a combined total of 183 participants. The Toftness technique, a little known technique that utilises a metered, hand-held pressure applicator was the subject of one trial with 30 participants. A meta-analysis combining results from all the trials was not feasible due to differences in the measurement, timing and reporting of pain outcomes and because only one trial was available for each outcome. Therefore results were reported with dichotomous, continuous or descriptive data separately.</P>
<P>HVLA manipulation was shown to be no more effective than sham manipulation (one trial, n = 44) although both treatments reduced the level of pain experienced. While the smaller trial indicated a difference in pain relief in favour of HVLA manipulation, the one trial with an adequate sample size (n = 137) and the best methodological rating found no difference between HVLA and sham treatments.</P>
<P>Results showed no significant differences in the adverse effects experienced by participants in the HVLA and sham treatment groups after one cycle of treatment. Overall there were few withdrawals from treatment but reporting of adverse events was not considered by most of the studies and it was not clear that the data presented in the studies reflected a comprehensive assessment of adverse events.</P>
<P>The Toftness technique was shown to be more effective than sham treatment at six months follow up, by one small trial, however three months following treatment the sham group had less pain. No strong conclusion can be made due to the small size of the single trial and other methodological considerations. There was a large difference in pain scores between the treatment and sham groups at baseline that may have had an impact on the results.</P>
<P>Additional outcome measures were reported by some of the included trials. Two trials reported a decrease in the circulating plasma levels of prostaglandin F2 alpha (<LINK REF="STD-Hondras-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hondras 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kokjohn-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kokjohn 1992</LINK>). Over production of this prostaglandin has been shown to be a substantial contributing factor to the painful cramps associated with dysmenorrhoea. The decrease occurred in conjunction with a decrease in pain and at the same rate in both the HVLA and sham manipulation treatment groups, with no difference in prostaglandin levels between the two groups.</P>
<P>These outcomes were used by the authors of the trials as an attempt to provide an objective measure of the efficacy of spinal manipulation. Although these measures add to our overall knowledge about the effects of spinal manipulation, physiological measures are not necessarily related to the pain levels experienced by dysmenorrhoeic women and are surrogate endpoints.</P>

To be successful in maintaining blinding, the participants entering the trial need to be naive to the treatment being offered. This is especially the case for spinal manipulation where the sham treatment differs intrinsically from the real treatment in order to avoid a therapeutic effect. Therefore, single blinding (of the participant) is considered difficult with the use of sham manipulation as a control and infeasible if the control is a different type of treatment, for example spinal manipulation versus a placebo pill.</P>
<P>Double blinding (blinding of both the participant and the treatment provider) in physical therapies is also generally considered impossible as the treatment provider needs to physically deliver the treatment or placebo. Spinal manipulation involves correction of the alignment of and restoration of mobility to select spinal vertebrae chosen for therapeutic effect and therefore needs to be performed by a skilled practitioner. As a result, it is probably impossible to perform a true double-blind trial of spinal manipulation although blinding of the participant and outcome assessors should be used, if possible.</P>

<P>
<B>Standardisation of treatment</B>
<BR/>Treatment providers perform physical therapies with variations. Treatment is often individually tailored to each participant's set of symptoms. Even if this is not the case different therapists vary the duration of treatment, the exact placement of manipulation along the spine, the force of manipulation, the types of manoeuvres, the frequency of treatments, timing of treatments in the cycle, and the number of treatments performed. These are all factors that make it difficult to assess the overall efficacy of spinal manipulation. The impact of these factors on treatment outcomes is not clear as these types of variations between practitioners of spinal manipulation can also be found in conventional medicine.</P>
<P>
<B>Use of sham manipulation</B>
<BR/>A difficult issue in all randomised controlled trials of physical therapies is what to use as a control or placebo treatment. To adequately control for all the factors that may contribute to the treatment effect, a comparable placebo treatment rather than a waiting list control or a no-treatment control is preferable. Study designs based on a sham treatment effectively control for any influence associated with the doctor-patient interaction as the procedures can be performed through use of an identical protocol, in the same clinical setting, and by the same practitioner.</P>
<P>There are a number of techniques used as placebo for spinal manipulation. The main principle is to use a non-therapeutic level of torque in the sham treatment. Therefore, peak forces delivered to the participants during sham manipulation thrust are substantially less than the peak forces delivered during true spinal manipulation therapy. Two common techniques for sham manipulation are where thrust is administered but the posture of the participant is such that the mechanical torque of the manipulation is substantially reduced; or through the use of an activator-adjusting tool which can make spinal adjustments using spring recoil, where the spring is set so no force is exerted.</P>
<P>There is no guarantee that using sham manipulation will have no effect. The activator-adjusting tool has been criticised as being an inadequate sham technique as force is still delivered even when the spring is set to zero (<LINK REF="REF-Harman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harman 2000</LINK>). The Hondras trial also acknowledged that their technique of sham manipulation (different patient position to lessen torque) may not have been an adequate placebo. In the attempt to ensure blinding of the participants, it is possible the sham manipulation techniques used by the trials included in this review may have had an unintended therapeutic effect. In most cases sham manipulation occurred in a slightly different area or with less force applied but it is unknown if these were sufficient differences for the intended sham treatments to be ineffective in relieving pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Other methodological issues</B>
<BR/>In the trials included in this review there were many differences in treatment schedules. Some treatments were scheduled during menses; however one trial also used pre-emptive treatment carried out at another time in the menstrual cycle. These different approaches could affect the outcome measures.</P>

<P>Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. In the one trial detailing adverse effects there was no greater risk of these effects with spinal manipulation than there is with sham manipulation.</P>
<P>Although the nature of physical therapy makes it difficult to blind participants to the intervention, future trials should maintain blinding for all outcome assessments. In addition, future trials should incorporate participants who are naive to spinal manipulation and should assess at the end of the trial the degree of participant blinding that occurred. Because trials involving sham manipulation may underestimate the actual benefit of spinal manipulation therapy, future trials should consider including a third arm, a no-treatment control group.</P>
<P>Another important aspect is the use of standardised outcomes (that is, VAS pain scales) and adequate reporting of these measures. Baseline characteristics should be reported along with standard deviations (for continuous variables) and the number of participants in each category (for categorical variables), and for every follow up measure.</P>
