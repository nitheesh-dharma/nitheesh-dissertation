<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-09-03 05:34:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Do speed cameras reduce road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-07 15:57:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and disability. The speed at which a vehicle travels is an important determinant of injury; the faster the vehicle is travelling, the greater the energy inflicted on the occupants during a crash, and the greater the injury.</P>
<P>Excessive speed (driving faster than the posted limit or too fast for the prevailing conditions) has been found to contribute to a substantial number of crashes. It is predicted that, if the number of speeding drivers is reduced, both the likelihood and severity of a crash will be lowered. Therefore, interventions aimed at reducing traffic speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries and deaths. The enforcement of safe speeds with speed cameras and associated automated devices is one such measure.</P>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of speed cameras, the authors examined all eligible studies, that is, studies that met pre-set standard criteria. We analysed the effect of speed cameras on speeding, road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths by comparing what was happening in road areas before the introduction of speed cameras and after their introduction, and also by analysing what was happening in comparable road areas where no speed cameras were introduced during the study period.</P>
<P>The authors accepted a total of 35 studies for review which met the pre-set criteria. All studies reporting speed outcomes reported a reduction in average speeds post intervention with speed cameras. Speed was also reported as either reductions in the percentage of speeding vehicles (drivers), as percentage speeding reductions over various speed limits, or as reductions in percentages of top end speeders. A reduction in the proportion of speeding vehicles (drivers) over the accepted posted speed limit, ranged from 8% to 70% with most countries reporting reductions in the 10 to 35% range.</P>
<P>Twenty eight studies measured the effect on crashes. All 28 studies found a lower number of crashes in the speed camera areas after implementation of the program. In the vicinity of camera sites, the reductions ranged from 8% to 49% for all crashes, with reductions for most studies in the 14% to 25% range. For injury crashes the decrease ranged between 8% to 50% and for crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries the reductions were in the range of 11% to 44%. Effects over wider areas showed reductions for all crashes ranging from 9% to 35%, with most studies reporting reductions in the 11% to to 27% range. For crashes resulting in death or serious injury reductions ranged from 17% to 58%, with most studies reporting this result in the 30% to 40% reduction range. The studies of longer duration showed that these positive trends were either maintained or improved with time.</P>
<P>The quality of the included studies in this review was judged as being of overall moderate quality at best, however, the consistency of reported positive reductions in speed and crash results across all studies show that speed cameras are a worthwhile intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths. To affirm this finding, higher quality studies, using well designed controlled trials where possible, and studies conducted over adequate length of time (including lengthy follow-up periods) with sufficient data collection points, both before and after the implementation of speed cameras, are needed. As none of the studies were conducted in low-income countries, research in such settings is also required. There is a greater need for consistency in methods, such as international standards for the collection and reporting of speed and crash data and agreed methods for controlling bias in studies. This would allow more reliable study comparisons across countries, and therefore greater ability to provide stronger scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of speed cameras.</P>

<P>Despite the methodological limitations and the variability in degree of signal to noise effect, the consistency of reported reductions in speed and crash outcomes across all studies show that speed cameras are a worthwhile intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-07 16:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The pandemic of road traffic deaths and injuries continues unabated. Each year almost 1.2 million people die and between 20 and 50 million people are injured or disabled worldwide as a result of road traffic crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>). For people under 44 years, road traffic crashes are a leading cause of death and disablement second only to HIV and AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>). The continuing advance of motorisation in many developing countries is likely to further exacerbate the problem. It is estimated that by 2020 road traffic crashes will have moved from ninth to third in the world ranking of burden of disease, as measured in disability adjusted life years (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). In 2003, the annual cost of road traffic crashes to Australia for example, was more than $17 billion per annum, or approximately 2.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (<LINK REF="REF-Connelly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connelly 2006</LINK>). This finding is consistent with other recent reviews of the costs of road traffic crashes in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-G-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs G 2000</LINK>) in which the mean costs have commonly been found to be in the order of 2-3% of GDP. Thus, the identification of effective strategies for the prevention of road traffic injuries is of public health and public finance importance globally.</P>
<P>The relationship between speeding and crash rate, and speeding and injury rate has been examined in many studies and reviewed by the US Transportation Research Board (<LINK REF="REF-US-TRB-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">US TRB 1998</LINK>). The relationship between speeding and the likelihood of crashing should be logical; increasing speed increases the reaction distance (the distance travelled while the driver is reacting to a situation) and the braking distance. In reality, the relationship between speeding and crash rate is not simple, but it is consistent across studies. In two-car crashes, the greater the deviation in speed from the average, the higher the rate of crashes. This relationship is thought to be due to increased interactions between vehicles when travelling at different speeds. In single-vehicle accidents, the higher the speed, the greater the risk of crashing. Whilst studies demonstrate that motorists travelling at both significantly higher and significantly lower than average speeds have a greater crash risk, it has also been highlighted that the relationship with lower speeds was due mainly to crashes involving turning and slowing vehicles (<LINK REF="REF-US-TRB-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">US TRB 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aarts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarts 2006</LINK>). The relationship between speeding and injury rate is straightforward; the faster the vehicle is travelling, the greater the energy absorbed by the occupants during the rapid change in velocity that occurs during a crash.</P>
<P>Speed limits on roads are used to regulate traffic speed and thus promote road safety by establishing an upper limit on speed, and by reducing the variance ('dispersion') of the speed of vehicles. As injury severity increases non-linearly in relationship to speed, curbing 'top-end' speeders should also reduce the number of deaths and severe injuries in those crashes that do occur. Speed limits are usually assigned by category, type, and design of the road (<LINK REF="STD-Chin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 1999</LINK>). The main purpose of speed limits is to regulate driving speeds to achieve an appropriate balance between travel time and risk (<LINK REF="REF-US-TRB-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">US TRB 1998</LINK>). Many countries provide some type of enforcement to ensure that drivers obey the posted speed limits.</P>
<P>In Australia, during 2002, there were 1715 fatal crashes, of which 562 were identified as involving excessive speed (defined as driving faster than the posted limit or too fast for the prevailing conditions), using data obtained from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (<LINK REF="REF-ATSB-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATSB 2003</LINK>). This finding is consistent with a 2004 report on fatality data from the United States which suggests that excessive speed likewise defined, is implicated in about 30% of all fatal crashes there (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-Department-of-Transportation-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. Department of Transportation 2004</LINK>). It is predicted that, if the number of drivers who are speeding is reduced, both the likelihood and severity of a crash will be lowered (<LINK REF="REF-Pilkington-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilkington 2002</LINK>). The enforcement of speed limits must be sufficient to ensure that drivers believe that if they speed, they will be caught. Police cannot be present on all roads at all times and therefore, in many countries, there is increasing use of automatic speed enforcement, using detection devices (speed cameras) that may be manned or unmanned, mobile or fixed, as well as overt or covert. Most of the older speed camera systems rely upon 35 mm wet film, which necessitates regular extraction from the units, while the newer systems employ digital and video cameras and transmit the information over data networks. Most speed cameras use a low-powered doppler radar speed sensor that triggers the camera to photograph vehicles and capture the licence plate number of vehicles travelling above a preset speed. Automated speed enforcement cameras take single spot or average vehicle speeds over several measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Decina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decina 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Automatic speed enforcement has the capability of being a substantial net revenue-raising activity. This blurs the line for the public as to whether governments use the device for safety or for fiscal reasons, and may harden attitudes towards their use. Some people view the introduction of speed cameras as a violation of their civil liberties. Legal issues, such as whether the owner or the driver of a vehicle is responsible for the speeding violation, also arise. The arguments for and against speed cameras have been highlighted in British Columbia, Canada. The trial by (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>) concluded that the introduction of cameras had reduced speeding, with a corresponding decrease in crashes, injuries and fatalities. Nevertheless, in June 2001, the speed camera program was discarded by the incoming government. However, most countries that have introduced speed cameras have tended to expand their use over time. This is particularly noticeable within the United Kingdom and Australia.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether the use of speed detection devices reduces the incidence of speeding, crashes, injuries and deaths. A secondary consideration was to examine the relative effectiveness of covert versus overt cameras, halo effects, and mean and actual speeds. Little empirical evidence currently exists for the relative effectiveness of covert detection devices versus devices that can be seen. It is thought that while overt cameras should reduce speeds at road crash 'black spots' (also called 'hotspots'), covert cameras should reduce speeds over a wider area (<LINK REF="REF-Keall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keall 2001</LINK>). Likewise, other questions that need to be answered centre upon the so-called 'halo' effects. For example, the length of time an effect of enforcement is present after detection devices have been removed is known as the time-halo. The distance-halo is the distance from the point of speed enforcement that the decrease in speed continues. Regarding speed, speed cameras may lower the mean (relative) speed on the road (for example, the mean speed could fall from 110 km/h to 107 km/h in a 100 km/h zone), or they may lower the top speeds (absolute) on the road (for example, the top speed may be 150 km/h pre camera and 130 km/h post camera in a 100 km/h zone). This review considered both types of speed reduction.</P>
<P>To ensure the highest possible level of evidence available, in the absence of randomised controlled trials, studies selected for this review included only before-after trials with control or comparison areas and interrupted time series studies. This is in contrast to the only other systematic review of speed cameras (where standardised calculated results were reported) which included both controlled and uncontrolled before-after studies (<LINK REF="REF-Pilkington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilkington 2005</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 21:37:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were five stages of the review process.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage 1: Identification of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>One author (CW) initiated the original search for trials. A second author (CMW) continued the search, finding titles, abstracts and landmark reports in the road safety research literature. Based on potential relevance deduced from reading abstracts, full studies were obtained and short-listed if appropriate for assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage 2: Selection of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>Relevant studies selected from the process in stage one were independently assessed against the inclusion criteria by three authors (CMW, CW, RLB). Investigators were contacted where possible for any additional information regarding trials that potentially fulfilled the inclusion criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage 3: Data Extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were independently extracted from the included studies by four of the authors (CMW, CW, JH, RLB) using a standardised form, which was piloted before use. Data were extracted on the following key elements:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>study design;</LI>
<LI>study length and data collection details;</LI>
<LI>setting of the study and nature of the roads;</LI>
<LI>types of interventions used;</LI>
<LI>characteristics of intervention and control sites;</LI>
<LI>measures of exposure and outcomes;</LI>
<LI>description and treatment of bias and confounding;</LI>
<LI>analyses and results.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Following data extraction, any differences or disagreements between reviewers were resolved by detailed discussion leading to consensus (CMW, CW, JH, RLB, NB). Where necessary and possible, additional information was sought from study authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage 4: Quality Assessment</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of the quality of non-randomised trials is problematic. Controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) are acknowledged as methodologically weaker than randomised controlled trials, and few if any validated quality assessment instruments exist for non-randomised studies. Having perused the literature for validated tools, and discussed the issue at length with experts in the field, we decided to use a quality assessment process based on the Data Collection Checklist described by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality assessment and scoring was performed independently by three authors (CMW, CW, RLB). The process was based on four of the seven criteria used for the quality assessment for CBA designs, and the two additional criteria for ITS designs, used by EPOC. The criteria chosen were those that are relevant to community trial designs and specifically determine the appropriateness of baseline measurements, characteristics of the control site, protection against contamination between sites, and reliability of the outcome measures, including; objectivity of measurement, results being reported with random variability and p-values, important potential confounders and risk of bias described and controlled for, and discussion of study generalisability. ITS studies were also scrutinised against the EPOC quality criteria of a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred, and at least three data collection points before and after the intervention. All disagreements were resolved by consensus. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> in the 'Additional Tables' section provides a list of the included studies with their individual quality grade.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage 5: Syntheses of results</HEADING>
<P>In order to facilitate the comparison of studies as well as to capture the effect of intervention(s) and relate them to control (non-intervention) data, a standardised and well-defined summary measure was devised. These summary measures were calculated where possible i.e. if required information was reported or adequate data was available for calculation. The tool selected was based on relative effects, rather than difference in effect, where the outcome after intervention is divided by that before intervention as an expression of the proportional change in the outcome.<BR/>Unadjusted data provided by study authors in their tables, text or on graphs was used to present results in relation to speed, numbers speeding, crashes, injuries and fatalities.</P>
<P>In addition to study traits and outcome data in the 'characteristics of included studies' table, the results and further information were also presented in the Summary of CBA studies - Crash Outcomes and Summary of CBA studies - Speed Outcomes tables. These tables show the outcomes reported by the study authors' and also those calculated by our review author JH which consisted of standardised calculated results where possible and the study information that the latter were based on. Studies that reported both speed and crash results were highlighted with an asterisk in the tables. The Summary of ITS studies table consists of the study authors' results, the outcome(s) analysed, statistical method, standardised calculated results where necessary (calculated by review author JH) and information that the latter were based on as well as quality grade.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">CBA studies</HEADING>
<P>The following descriptive summary statistics were used as the outcomes (speed and crash outcomes) for CBAs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Speed</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Relative speed ratio (RSR)</HEADING>
<P>RSR = (average speed post intervention ÷ average speed pre intervention) ÷ (average speed post control ÷ average speed pre control)<BR/>When expressed as a percentage, RSR measures the relative percentage change in speed after intervention i.e. relative to control.</P>
<P>
<I>Percentage Speeding Relative Rates Ratio (PSRRR)</I>
<BR/>PSRRR = (speeding rate post intervention ÷ speeding rate pre intervention) ÷ (speeding rate post control ÷ speeding rate pre control)<BR/>When expressed as a percentage, PSRRR measures the relative percentage change in speeding rates after intervention i.e. relative to control.</P>
<P>This applied to the percentage of vehicles speeding or percentage of speeders who were speeding in excess of a speed threshold.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Crashes (all crashes, injurious crashes and fatal crashes)</HEADING>
<P>
<I>Relative Crashes Ratio (RCR)</I>
<BR/>RCR = (crashes post intervention ÷ crashes pre intervention) ÷ (crashes post control ÷ crashes pre control)<BR/>When expressed as a percentage, RCR measures the relative percentage change in crash numbers after intervention i.e. relative to that for control. It is the same as the odds of crashing after intervention relative to the same odds if there were no intervention i.e. an odds ratio.</P>
<P>
<I>Percentage Crashes Relative Risks Ratio (PCRRR)</I>
<BR/>PCRRR = (crash risk post intervention ÷ crash risk pre intervention) ÷ (crash risk post control ÷ crash risk pre control)<BR/>When expressed as a percentage, PCRRR measures the relative risk of crashing post intervention, compared with pre-intervention, relative to that for control.</P>
<P>This applies to the percentage of vehicles crashing.</P>
<P>95% confidence intervals (CI) were included in parentheses. For all descriptive summary statistics, values less than 1 indicate a relative reduction, i.e. relative to control result. This reduction can be expressed as a percentage improvement using (1-summary statistic) x 100%.</P>
<P>In the case where the above descriptive statistics or CI were not supplied by the studies, but where there was sufficient other information, these were calculated. Statxact was used if data required exact methodology.</P>
<P>Weighted averages across strata were calculated unless weights were not supplied, in which case crude averages are used. Mean ratios were calculated using geometric means.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ITS studies</HEADING>
<P>Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ES-Barcelona" TYPE="STUDY">ES Barcelona</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Cambridge" TYPE="STUDY">GB Cambridge</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB Nationwide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NZ-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Nationwide</LINK>). The statistical analytical method used for ITS studies ranged from simple monthly averages pre and post intervention to more advanced methods such as ARIMA or multivariate regression using generalised linear models. Within a study, these analyses were performed for different outcomes and for different constructs or strata. For both speed and crashes, most ITS studies reported a calculated or estimated percentage change in the outcome after intervention, which they commonly defined as,<BR/>(Post intervention estimate - Pre intervention estimate) x 100 ÷ Pre intervention estimate.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis was not appropriate for this review due to pronounced heterogeneity and consequently we could not test for publication bias. For the same reason, we were unable to perform any reasonable subgroup analyses on the various types of SEDs e.g. overt versus covert camera issues.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-11-05 15:34:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>After full text review of all potentially relevant studies, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were observational in nature of which, 29 were controlled before-after trials (CBAs) incorporating a distinct control or comparison group(s) and six were interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with a comparison group(s). Seven studies had associated studies, which were subsumed in each of the seven primary studies. No randomised controlled trials were found.</P>
<P>As heterogeneity was widespread across studies we have included examples of variations in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> in the 'Additional Tables' section of this review, to make it easier for the reader to note differences between studies.</P>
<P>Because several studies emanated from the same country and some studies had one or more main authors in common, it was decided that naming studies according to the official country codes of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO-3166) was the clearest naming option.</P>
<P>Nineteen studies reported both speed and crash outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-3" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-Vancouver-B.C."

Nine studies reported only crash outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-AU-QLD-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU QLD 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-QLD-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU QLD 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-3" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ES-Barcelona" TYPE="STUDY">ES Barcelona</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Cambridge" TYPE="STUDY">GB Cambridge</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Norfolk" TYPE="STUDY">GB Norfolk</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-South-Wales" TYPE="STUDY">GB South Wales</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-West-London" TYPE="STUDY">GB West London</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NO-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NO Nationwide</LINK>) and seven studies reported only speed outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-South-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">AU South Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-Toronto" TYPE="STUDY">CA Toronto</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NO-Oslo" TYPE="STUDY">NO Oslo</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Arizona-2" TYPE="STUDY">US Arizona 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">US Maryland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Washington-DC" TYPE="STUDY">US Washington DC</LINK>). Of the included studies, six studies reported halo effects, with three studies describing time halo effects (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-Toronto" TYPE="STUDY">CA Toronto</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NO-Oslo" TYPE="STUDY">NO Oslo</LINK>) two studies reported distance halo effects (<LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FI-Finland" TYPE="STUDY">FI Finland</LINK>) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>) reported both time and distance halo effects.</P>
<P>
<I>Outcome measures</I> in the studies differed considerably and included various definitions and measures of speed, crashes, injuries and deaths. For some studies, results for 'all crashes' may be inclusive of property damage crashes, and it should be borne in mind that injury crashes are not always necessarily a subset of those that are speed related (assuming such crashes can actually be defined). Most studies analysed crash numbers rather than rates and only a few studies provided data on the aggregate (over crashes) of the number of fatalities and number of people, who sustained at least one injury.</P>
<P>
<I>Types of interventions</I> varied between studies. Speed enforcement detection devices (SEDs) were described according to whether they were overt or covert, whether they were operated from a fixed or mobile position on the road, or any combination of these four elements. For the purposes of this review, fixed SEDs were defined as speed cameras operating from a fixed mounted position on permanent poles and did not include speed cameras operating from patrol cars or working on temporarily installed poles. The latter, although stationary for a period were often moved from place to place. Seventeen studies assessed the effect of fixed cameras, of which, 16 studies had overt SEDs and one study had both overt and covert SEDs. Fifteen studies assessed the effect of mobile camera interventions. Of these, eight studies had overt and three had covert SEDs. Four studies had both a mixture of overt and covert SEDs. Two studies reported the effects from a combination of both fixed and mobile overt SEDs, and one study reported the effects of a combination of fixed, mobile, overt and covert SEDs. Studies also varied considerably in both the number and duration of intervention events. Interventions were continuous in only two of the studies. Continuous operation was defined as SEDs operating continuously at all experimental sites and did not include SEDs operating continuously at some sites on a random alternating basis.</P>
<P>All included studies took place in high income countries, with one study each from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong and Spain, two each from the Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway, three from Canada, five from the United States of America, six from the United Kingdom and 10 from Australia. Thirteen studies were conducted within an urban setting, six in a rural setting, seven occurred in a rural and/or a semi-rural location and nine studies were conducted within a mixed urban/rural/semi-rural environment. This diversity of study locations corresponded with a range of urban, semi-rural and rural speed limits within studies, that varied from 40 kilometres per hour (km/h) through 60 km/h, 80 km/h, 100 km/h and 110 km/h to corresponding speed limits in miles per hour (mph) in the UK and USA. Only eight studies described their criteria for speed limit compliance, above which traffic infringement notices were issued.</P>
<P>All included studies were published between 1984 and 2009, with study periods ranging from nine weeks to thirteen years; twelve trials had study periods of less or equal to 24 months, seven had study periods of 25 to 48 months (2+ to 4 years), nine had study periods of 49 to 72 months (4+ to 6 years), one of 73 to 96 months (6+ to 8 years), three of 97 to 120 months (8+ to 10 years) and three of equal or greater than 120 months (10 years plus). The major focus for studies of the shortest duration was the measurement of halo effects.</P>

<P>Four of the seven criteria outlined in the data collection checklist described by the Cochrane EPOC Review Group were used to establish the methodological quality of the included controlled before-after studies:</P>
<OL>
<LI>availability of baseline measurements;</LI>
<LI>appropriate choice of control;</LI>
<LI>protection against contamination between intervention and control site;</LI>
<LI>reliability of outcome measures.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition to criteria 1) and 4) above, two other criteria as described by EPOC were used to assess the methodological quality of ITS studies, which were, a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred, and at least three data collection points before and after the intervention.</P>
<P>The criteria for CBAs provided twelve key indicators in total, and the criteria for ITS studies provided a total of nine key indicators. The outcomes for the scoring method used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies can be viewed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. CBA studies were marked as either done, not clear, not done (as described by EPOC) for each of the twelve indicators, and again ITS studies were marked as either done, not clear, or not done for each of the nine indicators.<BR/>For studies to be then classified as high quality, moderate or low quality, the scoring was as follows;</P>
<P>CBA studies: High = (Done = 10, Not clear = 2, Not done = 0), Moderate = (Done = 8, Not clear = 2, Not done = 2), Low = (&lt; 8 Done).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Speed</HEADING>
<P>All studies reporting speed outcomes reported an absolute reduction in average speeds post intervention. Reductions were reported either as mean speeds, 'average speeds' or as median speeds. Most studies, thirteen in total, reported mean speeds (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-3" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-Vancouver-B.C."

The reduction in mean speeds ranged from 1.3km/h in New Zealand to 5.8 km/h in New South Wales, with most countries showing reductions in the 2 to 4 km/h range. For countries expressing speed in miles per hour, the mean speed reduction ranged from 6% in the United Kingdom nationwide to 14% in Washington D.C. Average speeds were reported by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NL-Netherlands" TYPE="STUDY">NL Netherlands</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NO-Oslo" TYPE="STUDY">NO Oslo</LINK>) and showed speed reductions ranging from 0.9km/h to 5 km/h. Median speeds were reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-AU-South-Australia" TYPE="STUDY">AU South Australia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DE-Germany" TYPE="STUDY">DE Germany</LINK>) with the former reporting a speed reduction of 5km/h and the latter recording reductions in median speeds of 40km/h and 28 km/h in car lanes, and a 23km/h reduction in the truck lane on the motorway after 10 years of continuous automated enforcement.</P>
<P>The standardised summary statistic relative speed ratio (RSR) that is, the relative percentage change in average speed after intervention i.e. relative to control could be calculated for nine of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NL-Friesland" TYPE="STUDY">NL Friesland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NL-Netherlands" TYPE="STUDY">NL Netherlands</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NZ-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Nationwide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">US Maryland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Arizona-2" TYPE="STUDY">US Arizona 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-North-Carolina" TYPE="STUDY">US North Carolina</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Washington-DC" TYPE="STUDY">US Washington DC</LINK>). From these studies, fourteen RSR results could be calculated which ranged from 0.85 to 0.99, indicating that relative post-pre reductions were an improvement on 'control' i.e. control arm(s) by between 1% to 15%. For eight of the RSRs, there was insufficient information to calculate confidence limits (CL). Of the remaining six RSRs, using CL as an indication of statistical significance, two RSRs were significant and four non-significant (Summary of CBA studies - Speed Outcomes <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Percentage speeding</HEADING>
<P>Speed was also reported as either absolute reductions in the percentage of speeding vehicles, as percentage speeding reductions over various speed limits, or as reductions in percentages of top end speeders. Eight standardised summary statistic percentage speeding relative rates ratio (PSRRR) could be calculated for eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FI-Finland" TYPE="STUDY">FI Finland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NL-Friesland" TYPE="STUDY">NL Friesland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NL-Netherlands" TYPE="STUDY">NL Netherlands</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NZ-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Nationwide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">US Maryland</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Washington-DC" TYPE="STUDY">US Washington DC</LINK>) and ranged from 0.35 to 0.86, indicating reductions of 14% to 65% relative to controls. For five of the PSRRRs there was insufficient information to calculate confidence limits (CL). Of the remaining three PSRRR's, using CL as an indication of statistical significance, two RSR's were significant and one non-significant (Summary of CBA studies - Speed Outcomes table).</P>
<P>An absolute reduction in the proportion of speeding vehicles (drivers) over the accepted posted speed limit, ranged from 8% in Finland to 70% in New South Wales, with most of the twelve countries reporting this outcome, in the 10 to 35% range.</P>
<P>For the proportion of vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph, an 82% absolute reduction was reported in the (<LINK REF="STD-US-Washington-DC" TYPE="STUDY">US Washington DC</LINK>) study. The calculated PSRRR was 0.35 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.40) indicating that the reduction was a significant improvement over that for controls. The Maryland study (<LINK REF="STD-US-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">US Maryland</LINK>) reported a 70% reduction; PSRRR 0.52 (CI incalculable) and the North Carolina study (<LINK REF="STD-US-North-Carolina" TYPE="STUDY">US North Carolina</LINK>) saw a 55% reduction (PSRRR incalculable) (<LINK REF="STD-GB-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB Nationwide</LINK>) reported a 43% reduction for vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 mph. For countries reporting in kilometres per hour the reduction for vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/h ranged from 4.5% in Denmark to an 88% reduction in New South Wales. Hong Hong reported a reduction of 65% for those exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 km/h and Victoria (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 2</LINK>) saw a 76% reduction in vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 30 km/h post implementation of the speed camera program.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Halo effects</HEADING>
<P>Two important measures of the local effect of automated enforcement on the speed distribution are the time halo and distance halo. The effect of the distribution of speeds at and around the site of enforcement whilst the enforcement takes place is known as the distance halo. The time halo is the effect on the distribution of speeds after the enforcement activity has been terminated. As the characteristics of studies, where a primary focus was the reporting of halo effects varied in terms of location, duration of intervention, data collection and measurement, a brief overview of each of the six studies that reported these halo effects is as follows:</P>
<P>New South Wales (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 1</LINK>) - Outcome = Time halo of at least two days.<BR/>Study period from February 1982 for a period of nine weeks.<BR/>Two experimental sites with police car stationed at both sites. The primary survey point was 300 metres downstream at site two where the experiment was covert. The secondary point was 200 metres upstream at site one, where the experiment was overt. The sites were in two lane sub-arterial urban roads with a 60km/h speed limit. Enforcement symbol in place and enforcement period was for one hour in the morning 8.00am to 9.00am and one hour in the afternoon 2.00pm to 3.00pm in February and March 1982.</P>
<P>Oslo (<LINK REF="STD-NO-Oslo" TYPE="STUDY">NO Oslo</LINK>) - Outcome = Time halo up to eight weeks during daylight hours, in 80 km/h zones three out of five measured time intervals showed a time halo effect of six weeks.<BR/>Study period August 1991 to December 1991.<BR/>Five patrols each consisting of one marked vehicle and two police officers, average nine hours of enforcement per day (388 hours of enforcement in six weeks). Continuous speed measurement for 24 hours every day during the sixteen week study period. Experimental road was a 35 km stretch of undivided two lane road in a semi-rural area divided into six sections for the experiment (control similar).</P>
<P>Toronto (<LINK REF="STD-CA-Toronto" TYPE="STUDY">CA Toronto</LINK>) - Outcome = Three day time halo for one dose of enforcement.<BR/>At least six days time halo for five consecutive doses of enforcement.<BR/>Study period October 1979 to December 1979; five week study. Data collection by 2.5 hours per day on weekdays of five consecutive weeks for each location. Automatic speed traffic data recorders were used. Four experiments are described. The four experiments differed in the number of days of enforcement. Each experiment consisted of measuring speed of vehicles before, during and after enforcement took place. Each of the four experimental sites had an 'upstream' enforcement and a 'downstream' measurement site (latter was 1km to 2.5 km from the site of enforcement). In experiment 1 the police van was visible in advance. In experiment 2 to 4 the police vehicle was visible to the driver only 200 to 300m before passing the speed sensors.</P>
<P>New South Wales (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>) - Outcome = Time halo at least one day after enforcement, distance halo up to 14 km downstream.<BR/>Study period December 1986 to March 1987 for speed.<BR/>Thirty-two sites of enforcement, aerial speed surveillance. From the 32 rural sites in place by December 1986, 10 experimental sites were chosen. Five matched control sites were selected.<BR/>
<BR/>Tasmania (<LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>) - Outcome = Distance halo up to 22 km.<BR/>Total study length was two years between December 1984 to December 1986.<BR/>Single overt police car, random scheduling low intensity enforcement for two hours per day, seven days per week at sites. Location was three rural or main roads with a 110 km/h speed limit divided into one km sections.</P>
<P>Finland (<LINK REF="STD-FI-Finland" TYPE="STUDY">FI Finland</LINK>) - Outcome = Distance halo 3 km upstream to two km downstream. Study period April 1990 to December 1993. Cameras rotated randomly between 12 camera poles at a distance of 1.5 km to 7 km from each other in one direction of enforcement. Duration of surveillance from 8 to 36 hours (operation time 8065 hours from April 1992 to December 1993).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Crashes</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported a reduction in road traffic crashes and crashes resulting in injury post speed camera intervention. The magnitude of this effect in crash outcomes varied considerably across studies. Crash outcomes were reported by twenty eight studies in total, of which, localised effects (that is, at or in the vicinity of camera sites) were reported by eleven studies. Twenty studies reported on generalised effects and three of the twenty eight studies reported both localised and generalised effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Localised crash effects</HEADING>
<P>The result for 'all crashes' showed pre/post percent reductions ranging from 8% in Victoria (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK>) to about 49% in Arizona (<LINK REF="STD-US-Arizona-1" TYPE="STUDY">US Arizona 1</LINK>) with all other studies reporting this outcome showing reductions in the 14% to 25% range. For crashes resulting in deaths or serious injuries pre/post percent average reductions of 11% at or less than 500m distance and 13% at or less than 1km distance were reported by (<LINK REF="STD-GB-30mph-Roads-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB 30mph Roads Nationwide</LINK>), reductions of 11.5% were seen in Victoria (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 2</LINK>) and reductions of 38%, 42% and 44% were reported by (<LINK REF="STD-AU-QLD-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU QLD 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB Nationwide</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GB-Norfolk" TYPE="STUDY">GB Norfolk</LINK>) respectively. Whilst a pre/post reduction of 22% in personal injury crashes at camera sites was found in one large study in (<LINK REF="STD-GB-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB Nationwide</LINK>) no significant reduction in injury crash frequency or severity was found within one km of camera sites, either in urban or rural areas, in another sizeable study in Victoria (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK>) as a result of camera site operations. However in this latter study a localised effect of 8.4% in pre/post injury crash reduction was found for all urban roads as a result of the influence of receipt of traffic infringement notices (TINs). A reduction of about 50% in injury crashes was reported by South Wales (<LINK REF="STD-GB-South-Wales" TYPE="STUDY">GB South Wales</LINK>) and the Cambridge study (<LINK REF="STD-GB-Cambridge" TYPE="STUDY">GB Cambridge</LINK>) reported a pre/post 45.74% reduction in injury crashes within 250m from camera sites and a lesser but significant 20.86% reduction inside a 2 km radius from the camera.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generalised crash effects</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes reported were pre/post reductions in 'all crashes' ranging from 9% in Christchurch (<LINK REF="STD-NZ-Christchurch" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Christchurch</LINK>) to 35% in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-NL-Netherlands" TYPE="STUDY">NL Netherlands</LINK>), with all other studies reporting reductions in the 11% to 27% range. For crashes resulting in death or serious injury pre/post percent reductions ranged from 17% in British Columbia (<LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>) to 58% in Tasmania (<LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>) with all other studies reporting this outcome in the 30% to 40% reduction range. For injury crashes pre/post percent reductions ranged from 17% in British Columbia (<LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>) and New Zealand (<LINK REF="STD-NZ-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Nationwide</LINK>) to 23% reductions for Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-DK-Denmark" TYPE="STUDY">DK Denmark</LINK>) and Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-HK-Hong-Kong" TYPE="STUDY">HK Hong Kong</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the outcome 'all crashes' 14 relative crash ratio (RCR) could be calculated for 12 studies and ranged in value from 0.53 (95% CI = 0.39-0.73) in Arizona (<LINK REF="STD-US-Arizona-1" TYPE="STUDY">US Arizona 1</LINK>) to 0.95 (95% CI = 0.73-1.22) in Vancouver (<LINK REF="STD-CA-Vancouver-B.C." TYPE="STUDY">CA Vancouver B.C.</LINK>) denoting reductions of 5% to 47% for 'all crashes' relative to controls. Using CL as an indication of statistical significance, eight RCRs were significant and six were non-significant. The RCR could be calculated for 11 studies reporting 'injury crash' results and ranged from 0.57 (95% CI = 0.32-1.03) in Arizona to 0.86 (95% CI =0.42-1.02) in Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-HK-Hong-Kong" TYPE="STUDY">HK Hong Kong</LINK>), of which two were significant and nine non-significant. For the few studies (4) where the RCR could be calculated for 'fatalities', the result ranged from 0.00 (95% CI =0.00-0.35) in New South Wales (<LINK REF="STD-AU-NSW-2" TYPE="STUDY">AU NSW 2</LINK>) to 0.72 (95% CI = 0.36 -1.08) in Tasmania (<LINK REF="STD-AU-Tasmania" TYPE="STUDY">AU Tasmania</LINK>). In the (<LINK REF="STD-GB-30mph-Roads-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB 30mph Roads Nationwide</LINK>) study both fatal and serious injury crashes were reported together. The RCR in this latter study, for at or less than the 500km distance was 0.69 (95% CI = 0.57-0.69) with an RCR 0.73 (95% CI = 0.53-0.93) calculated for &#8804; 1km distance from camera sites. Using CL as an indication of statistical significance, three of the five RCRs were significant and two non-significant. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-DE-Germany" TYPE="STUDY">DE Germany</LINK>) gave enough information to calculate the summary statistic percentage crash relative rates ratio (PSRRR), which was 0.44, CI incalculable. In summary, of the 30 RCRs calculated, 13 were significant and 17 were non-significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interrupted time series studies</HEADING>
<P>Interrupted time series analyses in this review were reported with both speed and crash outcomes for six countries (<LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK>) Phase I and II; state-wide and metropolitan); (<LINK REF="STD-ES-Barcelona" TYPE="STUDY">ES Barcelona</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Cambridge" TYPE="STUDY">GB Cambridge</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GB-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB Nationwide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NZ-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">NZ Nationwide</LINK>) with the British Columbia study (<LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK>) also reporting some time series data. The statistical analytical method used ranged from simple monthly averages pre and post intervention to more advanced methods like ARIMA or multivariate regression using generalised linear models. Within a study, these analyses were performed for different outcomes and for different constructs or strata. Most studies reported results as estimated percentage changes in the outcome after intervention and the results can be viewed further in Table 1. Times series analysis was also used to analyse the head-count of crash victims. <LINK REF="STD-CA-British-Columbia" TYPE="STUDY">CA British Columbia</LINK> estimated a drop in crash victims of -31 to -140, while NZ estimated percentage changes in casualties, compared with control, of -19% and -31%. It was noted in <LINK REF="STD-AU-VIC-1" TYPE="STUDY">AU VIC 1</LINK> (Phase 2), the ratio of fatal plus serious crashes to minor crashes (severity), was analysed using a multiplicative model. Significant reductions in crashes were reported (p&lt;0.01) on a log scale linked to increases in traffic infringement notices (TINs) issued and increased publicity, whilst significant reductions in severity were attributable to increases in TINs issued and hours of speed camera operation.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-09 21:37:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research conducted to date consistently shows that speed cameras are an effective intervention for reducing road traffic injuries and deaths. The methodological quality of the included studies in this review was at best moderate. Only twelve of the thirty five studies reviewed were categorised as being of high quality (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) in the 'additional tables' section. A previous systematic review also noted the 'weak level of evidence available' (<LINK REF="REF-Pilkington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilkington 2005</LINK>). However it was noted in this review that, in general, some of the more recent studies were conducted with greater methodological rigour.</P>
<P>Whilst randomised controlled trials offer the highest level of evidence, we found no studies using this study design. In an effort to account for local variation, we only included studies in this review that also had control or comparison areas with acceptable before and after study periods. With the exception of studies of short duration, whose outcome focus was the evaluation of speed and/or halo effects, all the included studies collected at least one year of 'before 'data and one year of 'after' data, with fourteen studies having at least two years of 'before' data and a follow-up period of at least two years.</P>
<P>Assessment of the quality of non-randomised controlled trials is problematic. After an extensive review of the quality tools available, we decided a modified version of the quality assessment process, as developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group best suited the evaluation of the studies under review. It is well known that the number of potential confounding variables in road safety evaluation studies is very large. Although we looked for how studies controlled or adjusted for any confounding variables, in regards to risk of bias and potential confounders, our main focus was on three variables known to be particularly important in road safety evaluations i.e. regression to the mean, long term trends and changes in traffic volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Hauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauer 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Random fluctuations in recorded number of crashes occur in the long-term. Speed cameras are most frequently introduced at sites based on their more recent history of high rates of speed related crashes. However, it is possible that these crash frequencies were at the high end of naturally occurring random fluctuations, and that in due course crash numbers would regress back to the mean. We checked whether studies had controlled for regression to the mean (RTM) and for those which did not take it into account, we assessed where possible, if it was likely to be an important source of bias. Only ten studies out of a probable twenty four studies, where RTM may have been a sizeable factor, either described and/or controlled for its effects. Some of these ten studies used Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical methods to control for RTM, and this procedure has been suggested as the ideal standard method that future studies should employ (<LINK REF="REF-Hauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Decina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decina 2007</LINK>). Likewise, only a small number of studies controlled for other long term trends in crash rates and changes in traffic volumes. For example, the examination of possible traffic or crash migration to non-enforced routes is important. This is more likely to occur with fixed overt speed cameras. There is a need for better vehicle exposure/traffic volume data collection over time, so that noteworthy changes can be incorporated when analysing the effects of road safety programs. This is particularly important in light of the fact that studies available in this field have a quasi-experimental design, where the adequacy and appropriateness of comparison/control areas is often questionable. Regarding other possible effects on speed or crashes such as season, time of day, changes in road design, speed limits, and levels of road safety publicity, most studies only controlled for, or described a few of these, if any. No studies provided a rationale for the type of automated enforcement chosen in their particular case. Whilst resource costs are always a consideration, it would enhance the road safety evidence base if studies provided a comprehensive rationale for both the type and number of interventions chosen and their justifications for the length of study and amount of data collected.</P>
<P>We would have liked to have seen much more information on the comparison/control sites to help us judge how well the experimental and control sites were matched. With the exception of a few studies, much of this information was missing. A couple of studies reported that it is difficult, if not impossible, to find matching controls in some places, especially where the use of speed cameras is widespread and in operation for periods greater than ten years. In the United States, where automated speed enforcement is not yet widespread, in contrast to many European countries and Australasia, there is still an opportunity to conduct well-designed studies.</P>
<P>There was considerable heterogeneity across studies involving variations in speed limits, types and duration of interventions, length of follow up periods, setting of interventions, numbers of intervention and control sites and outcome measures. These factors made it difficult to integrate and summarise the evidence. We could not evaluate publication bias due to heterogeneity. However it is reasonable to expect that if any published negative studies existed, they would have received a high degree of publicity, considering the ongoing controversial nature of the debate surrounding speed cameras, in high income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Pilkington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilkington 2005</LINK>). In relation to statistical analysis, methods used varied from the application of basic univariate analysis through to more rigorous statistical methodology for interrupted time series data. In some instances authors had developed in-house methods for analysing their data. Furthermore, the way in which results were reported varied extensively across studies, and one of the difficulties we faced was finding the basic information needed to calculate a standardised summary statistic in an effort to compare studies. It is recommended that there be some international consensus as to the expression of outcomes, for example, crash rates per volume of traffic; percentage pre/post changes in speed and percentage pre/post changes relative to controls, all with the accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Until this occurs meta-analysis is not possible. Realistically some heterogeneity will persist across studies as researchers need to work in conjunction with government and local authorities to address such issues as speed limits, road design, traffic flow, co-interventions. At analyses stage, statistical models can be adjusted for these factors. Heterogeneity can also be dealt with by the use of sub-group analysis. However, this opportunity is dependent on the collection and provision of high quality and detailed data.</P>
<P>In light of the differences between studies, to critically appraise the results from the 35 studies in this review we examined certain issues which are relevant to making inferences about treatment effects. To this end, we examined the &#8216;signal to noise effect&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2007</LINK>) and the criteria espoused by Austin Bradford Hill (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1965</LINK>) to determine the strength of inferences.</P>
<P>The determination of speed camera effect on speed, speeding and crashes is made difficult because traffic volume and speed are not stable but fluctuating, resulting in different degrees of signal to noise on any given road as well as from one road to another. Decreases in average speed, percent speeding and crashes after the introduction of speed cameras were consistently reported across the studies, which strengthens the evidence of a treatment effect. However the magnitude of the effect was variable, ranging from 8% to 70% reductions for speeding over the posted speed limit, 43% to 65% for exceeding the speed limit by 15km/hr or over and 8% to 55% reductions for any type of crash. These are therefore insufficient alone to discriminate signal from noise in the effect. However in this review, in the absence of randomised controlled trials, the inclusion of only controlled before and after studies went some way towards addressing this, by measuring the effect relative to a control situation, as did the inclusion of interrupted time series studies to examine the longer term effect. This was further strengthened by evaluating how the included studies addressed bias attributable to regression to the mean effect.</P>
<P>Austin Bradford Hill (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1965</LINK>) proposed a list of criteria for strengthening confidence in inferences about treatment effects. The application of these to this speed camera review indicated that all of the studies met the following criteria;</P>
<P>
<I>Temporality </I>- speed camera implementation preceded reductions in speed and crashes.</P>
<P>
<I>Consistency</I> all studies, despite different investigations, various times, alternative methodologies, different populations and a variety of geographic settings showed similar results i.e. reductions in speed and crashes.</P>
<P>
<I>Theoretical plausibility</I> - the theory that speed camera implementation with associated fines and penalties will result in speed reduction and thus crashes, was a highly plausible explanation.</P>
<P>
<I>Coherence</I> - the conclusion &#8216;made sense&#8217; given the current knowledge about human behaviour and the control of traffic speeds.</P>
<P>
<I>Specificity</I> - with regards to the observed reduction in speed and crash outcomes being specifically due to the introduction of speed cameras, the use of control roads or control sections of road, assisted in ruling out other possible causes.</P>
<P>
<I>Strength of effect</I> - the strength of intervention, which was examined using the 95% confidence interval for speed and crash based effects relative to control, was inconclusive. This was due to insufficient reporting and lack of data for calculating confidence intervals in most studies.</P>
<P>
<I>Dose-response</I> - no studies specifically looked at dose-response<I> </I>relationships in terms of systematically increasing the number of speed cameras and examining this effect on speed or crashes.</P>
<P>Considered together the studies included in this review met the first 4 and arguably 5 of the 7 criteria listed in the Bradford-Hill guide. The results of this systematic review were consistent across all studies, showing that speed cameras do reduce road traffic crashes, as well as those resulting in road injuries and deaths. Whilst this is an important finding, as the prevention of any road injury or death is desirable, we are unable to deduce the overall magnitude or significance of this effect.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are difficult to conduct in road safety enforcement studies. For instance, speed cameras are most often introduced at sites based on their history of high rates of speed related crashes. In these cases it would be considered unethical to randomise intervention to some traffic 'hot-spots' and not to others, especially when the hypothesis is that the intervention will be beneficial. Instead of camera deployment to high crash locations only, it may be worthwhile expanding location criteria, thereby enabling RCTs to be ethically conducted in areas other than high risk. It has been suggested that to realise the full potential safety benefits of speed cameras, wider deployment is needed, taking into consideration less traumatic crashes, as well as fatal and serious crashes, in selecting locations for new cameras. It is argued that camera deployment on sites with large numbers of less serious crashes, would reduce the number of these crash types and perhaps proactively prevent more serious crashes (<LINK REF="STD-GB-30mph-Roads-Nationwide" TYPE="STUDY">GB 30mph Roads Nationwide</LINK>). This proposed expansion however, may require a paradigm shift in public attitudes to speeding, as currently some resentment towards automated enforcement exists and speeding, despite it being a significant factor in road injuries and deaths, remains socially acceptable.<BR/>
<BR/>Countries currently considering introducing speed cameras have a unique opportunity to plan the deployment of speed cameras in such a way that it also provides the basis for solid evidence of their effect on speed and crash outcomes. As a result, well-executed RCTs, using matched pairs of camera locations or clusters of camera locations, as well as quasi-experimental research designs such as, controlled before-after trials (using matched location groups) and additionally interrupted time series studies could be conducted. Furthermore, a lengthy pre-deployment stage would be necessary, with speed and crash data meticulously collected, under pre-specified transparent guidelines and methodology. Collection needs to continue in this way during the intervention period and for a lengthy follow-up period after intervention. However difficult, there is a need for international standardization of data collection methods, including standards on how best to collect and measure speeds and crash data, thus enabling the comparison of studies. A controlled introduction of speed camera enforcement methods is important with careful future planning and anticipated outcomes in mind. In the case of RCTs, a large sampling framework of similarly defined 'lower' risk sites could be ear-marked for randomisation to the intervention and control arms.</P>
<P>The safety benefits of speed camera enforcement (both mobile and fixed cameras) reported in this systematic review are consistent with recent reports elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wegman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wegman 2006</LINK>) showing consistent reductions in average speeds and proportion of speeding drivers over the speed limits reflected in reductions in all crash types, with more marked effects as expected, in the vicinity of camera sites than in the wider areas. Also consistent with the former reports, reductions for serious injury crashes and fatalities are greater than for all other injury crashes, and effects in urban areas are greater than on rural roads. No sub-group analysis could be performed in this review to compare in any consistent way, the effects of fixed cameras versus mobile cameras because of the considerable heterogeneity alluded to earlier. Whilst the results for studies with a specific focus on time and distance halo effects all showed positive effects, results defied comparison because of the many differences in study periods, number of interventions and methodology.</P>
<P>One of the associated problems with automated speed enforcement is the tendency for some drivers to brake when passing a speed camera and then to speed in excess of the speed limit when out of range of the camera. This behaviour is implicated in some crashes. A relatively new method which has the potential to ameliorate this, is road section control or average speed check. Unlike conventional automated speed systems which measure the speed of a vehicle at one point, section control systems measure the average speeds over a distance from at least 500m to several kilometres. Such a measure can reasonably be expected to have a more sustained positive behavioural effect and perhaps change the culture of speeding over a longer time (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenbeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenbeld 2005</LINK>). In the past few years, section control has been introduced in a number of countries and into the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in particular, however, assessment of the unfolding technology and ongoing robust trials are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of this innovation. All studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review were conducted in high-income countries. This limits the generalisability of the findings. Middle and low-income countries are gradually introducing speed cameras, however the findings of studies from high-income countries cannot be assumed to apply to these countries. This presents a unique research opportunity for these countries to conduct studies, where the subject of speed cameras is not politicised and yet can be informed by the strengths and weaknesses of the research to date.</P>
<P>Much of road safety research is published in the grey literature. Every possible effort was made to find all relevant controlled trials, however unlike medical databases, which include terms describing the study methodology among its indexing; road safety databases have a very limited range of indexing terms, which made the identification of appropriate studies difficult. A need exists for authors to adequately describe the study design in their reports, and for editors to demand this, so that improvements in thesaurus terms can be made to road safety databases.</P>
<P>Although studies were conducted in varied rural and urban locations, only a few studies reported on the frequency of injurious crashes for different categories of road user (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, vehicle occupants) therefore not enough data existed to examine the effect of automated enforcement on road trauma by road user category.</P>
<P>The possibility of using speed cameras and associated automated devices in concert with the developing field of Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) systems (<LINK REF="REF-Carsten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carsten 2002</LINK>) to further enhance road safety was not within the scope of this current review, but merits further research.</P>
<P>A sizeable body of literature exists which convincingly demonstrates the relationship between relative and absolute excess in speed and road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths. The role for regulating, monitoring, and enforcing speed limitations is not in doubt. The principal problem with traditional enforcement systems is that conventional law enforcement has not been able to keep pace with increased traffic volumes and increased vehicle mileage worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Decina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decina 2007</LINK>). Aberrant speeding behaviour is widespread and the use of speed cameras and associated automated devices is considered the most efficient way to significantly increase both detection and apprehension rates (<LINK REF="REF-Zaal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaal 1994</LINK>). The main issue then, is establishing that speed camera enforcement reduces road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths, as per the findings in this review. It is speculative whether more intense speed enforcement and higher penalties would be more effective, particularly for more substantial deviations from the posted speed. However, the rationale of using speed cameras to impose safe speeds and limit maximum speeds, for improving road safety is well-founded.</P>

<P>Speed cameras and related automated enforcement devices are worthwhile interventions for reducing road traffic injuries and deaths in both rural and urban settings. Considering continuing increases in traffic volume worldwide, automated enforcement with speed cameras to curb aberrant speeding behaviour, is a rational intervention to augment or supersede conventional enforcement. Speed cameras used for road section control, which measure average speed over distance, together with related emerging technologies arguably have the potential to favourably influence speeding behaviour and thus enhance road safety.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-03 21:26:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review are consistent across studies, showing that speed cameras do reduce road traffic crashes, as well as those resulting in road injuries and deaths. However, in this study, an overall magnitude or significance of this effect could not be deduced because of heterogeneity in background information and road and traffic related factors. An extensive literature exists on issues pertaining to speed cameras. Nonetheless, when searching for studies we found numerous uncontrolled before after studies, many studies without any 'before' data and no randomised controlled trials. For the future, interventions using speed cameras and related automatic speed enforcement devices need to be scientifically evaluated using well designed trials, conducted over sufficient time, with several data collection points and controls where possible. These studies also need to clearly show how potential study bias and confounding is controlled, and use standardised study analyses and outcome methodology, so that their true effectiveness can be more accurately assessed. Ideally, this can be more readily achieved if road safety authorities and academic research entities collaborate in the conduct of automated speed enforcement studies through all phases, from program planning to program completion.</P>

<P>This systematic review is based on the specifications within the protocol and follows on as a natural expansion, with no differences or conflict between protocol and review. However, the title used for the protocol 'Speed enforcement detection devices for preventing road traffic injuries' has been changed to a less cumbersome and easier to find title for the review, and is now titled 'Speed cameras for the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths'. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Controlled before-after study.<BR/>'Before' crash data January 1985 to November 1986. 'After' crash data January to November 1987. Only 100 km/h speed limit areas within sites used for crash data.<BR/>Study period for speed data, December 1986 to March 1987. <BR/>Speed data points - before and again at three and six weeks after start of aerial enforcement.<BR/>Two sites were chosen for detailed examination. Speed was measured at four locations (upstream and downstream as well as within marked area) for each site on four days - one day before aerial enforcement, during, one day after and on the fourth day after operation started.<BR/>14 experimental and 14 control sites used for crash analyses and 10 experimental and 5 control sites used for speed analyses.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>This study reports an investigation of crashes at nine of 24 rural highway sites in New South Wales that came into operation in December 1986. The nine experimental grids provided 14 experimental sites which were matched by 14 control sites. <BR/>For speed, 10 experimental sites were chosen and five matched control sites were selected. All sites were within a 100 km/h speed limit zones except for two experimental sites and one control site, which were in 110 km/h zones.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Aerial surveillance involving a police aircraft flying at 500 to 700m over a series of marked grids on roadways. Speeds were calculated by an observer using a stopwatch and radar unit who timed vehicles over set distances and radioed 'speeder information' to ground crew police in hidden patrol car who then issued speeders with traffic infringement notices.</P>

<P>Reports crash and speed outcomes.<BR/>The main finding was a 23% reduction in crashes at experimental sites during the day and a 21% reduction at other times, relative to trends in crashes at control sites.<BR/>Reduction in overall mean speed was a small 2-3 km/h. Similar reductions were found at controls sites. While aerial surveillance was operating, speed reductions extending up to 14 km's downstream from the marked zone was evident and some reduction was evident for the day after.<BR/>

<P>Experimental (E) and control (C) sites were matched in terms of suitability for aerial surveillance, on average annual daily traffic (E sites averaged 7,200 vehicles per day while C sites averaged 8,000), length (E sites averaged 14.3 km while C sites averaged 16.6 km), road classification ( all sites were 2 or 3 lane rural highways) and speed limit ( all had a predominant 100 km/h limit).<BR/>The possibility of regression to mean regarding the number of crashes at experimental versus control site was discussed.<BR/>When comparing both crash and speed outcomes, the speed effects were small, however, the speed study was conducted over a short six week period whilst it was noted from the 'crash study' findings, that crash effects were only evident after the program had been in operation a few months.</P>

Calculation of net percentage change between control and experimental groups was designed to control for other confounders.<BR/>The analysis assumed that crashes were exclusively influenced by the most recent mobile radar enforcement present in a particular region. This most recent enforcement was considered to override any enforcement that occurred one to four days earlier, which also may have influenced crash rate. Given that a four day residual effect on crashes was found in the analysis, the study authors acknowledge the most recent enforcement may not necessarily have been the most important in influencing crash frequency.</P>

<P>The outcomes measured for speed were mean speeds, 85th percentile speeds and percentage exceeding the 30 mph speed limit.

The reduction in all speed measures was statistically significant at the 5% level.The outcomes measured for crashes were personal injury crashes at various distance from the enforcement site as well as fatal and severe injury crashes. Separate crash outcome estimates are given for the effects of traffic flow and crash migration as well as for changes in general crash trends and RTM.</P>
<P>For personal injury crashes (PIA's) the observed effect for up to the 500m distance, was a 36% (-51 to -11 95%CI) reduction with a 34% (-33 to -13 95%CI) reduction in fatal and serious crashes. After adjusting for trend, the outcome translated to a 30% reduction in all PIA's with a 29% reduction in all fatal and serious crashes up to the 500m distance. Estimates of changes in crashes attributable to RTM effects showed a reduction for both types of crashes at all distances up to 1km, The RTM effect varied from a - 4% for personal injury crashes to a reduction of -18% for fatal and serious crashes. The latter accounted for over half of the overall observed decrease in fatal and serious crashes for 500m monitoring length. After accounting for all potential confounders including changes in speed and traffic flow, the overall average effect of speed cameras on crashes was a reduction of 25% in PIA's and an average 11% reduction in fatal and serious crashes for the 500m monitoring length, with a similar average 24% reduction in PIA's and 13% reduction in fatal and serious crashes at the 1km length.</P>

<P>The estimate of crash trend effects showed a conflicting average increase for personal injuries due to trend and an average decrease for fatal and serious crashes. The authors state this is a consequence of the range of implementation dates for the 62 camera sites, and that one needs to consider whilst the underlying trend is downwards for all crashes, total personal injury crashes tend to fluctuate with several year on year increases before declining again, whereas fatal and serious injuries tend to decline more consistently. Hence results need to be considered in light of implementation dates.</P>

This equated to about 1700 fewer KSI's per annum at these camera sites. Fixed cameras in both urban (47% reduction) and rural areas (62% reduction) were more effective than mobile camera sites in urban (35% reduction) and rural areas (34% reduction) at reducing KSI's. Across all sites PIC's decreased by 22%. This equated to a reduction in PIC's of about 4200 at camera sites. Overall fixed sites were slightly more effective at reducing PIC's (-24%) when compared to mobile sites (-21%). Fixed camera sites in rural locations were the most effective combination at reducing PIC's (-33%) however across all sites, 85% of the reduction in PIC's was in urban areas.

<P>Crash analysis accounted for speed limits, seasonality and time trends.

Did not discuss potential impacts of these factors. No discussion regarding traffic volumes before and after implementation or how comparison sites matched regarding traffic flow. No discussion regarding possible crash migration effects resulting from the enforcement program. The effects of regression to the mean RTM, were considered using an empirical Bayes approach for a small sub-set of sites only. This sub-set was not representative of all camera sites nationally, consisting only of single carriageway urban roads with mainly 30 mph speed limits.

The control group was 15 comparable rural road sections within the province of Friesland, with a total length of 51km and speed limits of 80 km/h. For crashes, the treatment group involved all 28 speed camera enforced rural road sections, 23 of which, had speed limits of 80 km/h and 5 had speed limits of 100km/h. The control group were all other non-enforced rural roads in Friesland,approximately 5200 km in total length.</P>

<P>Speed outcomes were annual mean speeds per road section and annual percentage of speeders over the targeted speed limit. The results were a non-significant mean speed reduction of 4 km/h on the enforced roads and a 1.5km/h reduction on the control roads between 1997 and 2002. The percentage of speeders decreased by 12% on the treatment roads compared to 5% decrease on the control road sections. Greatest reductions in mean speeds and percentage of speeders occurred at the start of the enforcement program and again in 2001 when enforcement was intensified. Regarding crashes, odds ratios for injury accidents (all severities) was 0.79 ( 0.66-0.95) showing a 21% reduction for the enforcement period compared to the before period on the enforced sections of roads. The odds ratio for serious traffic casualties (fatalities plus hospital admissions) was also 0.79 ( 0.63-0.99).</P>

<P>Each enforced road had a posted road sign warning that stated speed camera enforcement was possible. This sign was constantly present, independent of the actual presence of enforcement. Regarding speed effects, the control group had much lower traffic volumes compared to the treatment group (3800 versus 7200 vehicles per hour in 1997). According to the authors the odds ratios for crashes was estimated, based on relatively small numbers. Extensive weekly media coverage and a dedicated publicity officer were used for a public information and education campaign. This factor plus RTM and program spillover effects were among possible confounders. However, authors argue RTM was unlikely to be an issue because crash rate had remained similar for 8 years.</P>

Results from 6 weeks and 5 months showed large speed reductions at Glendale (Comparison site) so a 2nd comparison location for analysis was added (non-Loop 101, routes 202 and 51) with 2 data collection points at 8 months and 12 months (December 2006) for the new comparison site before data for 'mean speeds' only, was obtained from the Arizona Department of Transportation therefore the mean speeds for all vehicles were used to compare speed between Loop 101 and non-Loop 101.</P>

<P>Outcomes measured were total crashes, crash severity and crash type, mean,median, 85th percentile speeds, percentage of vehicles exceeding speed limit by &gt;10 miles/hour and speed variance. 3 different crash data sets were analysed: Firstly using Hauer's comparison group methodology 'total crashes' were analysed for period between January 2000 and December 2003. The 2nd data set from January 2003 to July 2004 was used to analyse if regression to the mean confounded the study results and the 3rd crash data sub-set analysed data from the 5 most heavily enforced corridors (accounting for 90.4% of the total citations) during the period September to December 2004. The aggregated change in total crashes was a statistically significant 12% reduction for treated corridors compared to the expected number, following enforcement with speed cameras. Results from the 2nd analysis showed a 11% statistically significant reduction in crashes in the treatment group and concluded that regression to the mean was 'likely negligible' .For the 5 heavily enforced corridors a statistically significant 14% reduction in crashes for treated corridors was reported compared to the expected number. The calculated relative crash ratio (RCR) for all crashes was 0.84 with 95%CI (0.76-0.93) day-time, and 01.04 (0.85-1.28) night-time. For injury crashes the calculated RCR with 95% CI was 0.78 (0.53-1.15) day-time and 0.75 (0.40-1.40) night-time.</P>
<P>Using GLM and logistic regression models, reported mean speeds at treatment sites were a statistically significant 0.91 miles per hour (mph) reduction after the implementation of enforcement. The control sites showed a statistically non-significant 0.29 mph mean speed reduction. The results for 85th percentile speeds were a statistically significant 0.99 mph reduction at treatment sites and a non-significant 0.30 mph reduction at control sites. Two-tailed F-tests with significance level set at 0.05 were used to test for before and after periods and day versus night. The calculated relative speed ratio RSR (relative to control) was Day 0.99 (0.76-1.23) Night 0.98 (0.76-1.20) The percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit by 10 mph or more decreased by a statistically significant average of 55% at treatment sites compared to control sites which showed very little change. Forty eight percent of treatment sites compared to 30% of control sites showed a reduction in speed variance although considerable difference in speed variance at the different treatment and control sites was noted.</P>
