<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-05 14:51:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Venous leg ulcers (which appear as open sores) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the legs. Compression of the leg, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), is known to help heal venous ulcers. Flavonoids, which are commonly used as food supplements, occur in a variety of plant-based foods and beverages, including cocoas, chocolates, teas and red wines. They are sometimes used to try to promote ulcer healing in the leg. This review of clinical trials concluded that there is some evidence to show that flavonoids can help heal venous leg ulcers, however, many trials were not reported well, and we could not know for certain whether the apparently beneficial effects were real or not. This meant that we could not draw firm conclusions, or recommend routine use of flavonoids for people with leg ulcers. Larger and better conducted trials are needed to assess the true clinical effect of flavonoids.</P>

<P>Meta-analysis involving 723 participants from five trials - four of which were characterised by poor reporting - showed more venous leg ulcers were healed in the MPFF groups than in the control groups (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74). However, the most rigorously conducted trial, which was at low risk of bias, did not show any additional benefit of MPFF (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22). Since this trial was unpublished, the possibility of publication bias in trials involving flavonoids must be acknowledged. Overall, the quality of reporting of trials on HR was also poor. Pooling three trials, all at unclear risk of bias, involving 279 participants showed a statistically significant effect in favour of HR with respect to number of ulcers healed (RR 1.70; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.34).</P>

<P>Although the overall estimate of the number of healed ulcers appeared to show a significant effect in favour of flavonoids (both MPFF and HR), this result needs to be interpreted cautiously, as most of these trials were poorly reported, and so had an unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and methods for addressing incomplete outcome data. There was also a possibility of publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Venous leg ulcers - prevalence and burden</HEADING>
<P>Leg ulceration is defined as the loss of skin below the knee on the leg or foot which takes more than six weeks to heal (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1997</LINK>). Many factors can be associated with leg ulcer development. The four most common causes of leg ulceration are venous insufficiency (venous disease), arterial insufficiency, nerve damage (often due to diabetes mellitus), and prolonged pressure and ischaemia (low oxygen levels) (<LINK REF="REF-Araujo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araujo 2003</LINK>). Several studies found that about 60 to 80% of chronic leg ulcers were venous in origin (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bello 1998</LINK>). In the UK, data from prevalence surveys suggest a much broader range of uncertainty around the prevalence of uncomplicated venous leg ulceration, i.e. between 51% to 85% of all leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Cornwall-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornwall 1986</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Callam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salaman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salaman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>), while recent pragmatic audits suggest that the prevalence of  uncomplicated venous leg ulcers is much lower at between 38% to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasaiah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasaiah 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>An estimated 5% to 8% of the world's population is afflicted with venous disease (<LINK REF="REF-Trent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trent 2005</LINK>). While venous disease affects a large proportion of the population, however, only a small percentage proceed to the most severe form of venous disease, which is ulceration. Several population-based prevalence studies reported prevalence rates of open leg ulcers that ranged from 0.12% to 1.1% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelzen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelzen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>). Within the UK population, the estimated prevalence of leg ulcers is 1.5 to 3 per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1997</LINK>). Prevalence, however, increases with age, reaching 20 per 1000 in people over 80 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Venous leg ulcers are widely considered to be a major health problem, and social and economic burden (<LINK REF="REF-Simka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simka 2003</LINK>). The estimated cost of venous ulceration to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is GBP 400 million a year (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstantinos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstantinos 2005</LINK>), and in the UK, France and Germany, the cost of venous ulcers is estimated to be 1.5% to 2.0% of the total annual healthcare budget (<LINK REF="REF-Trent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trent 2005</LINK>). As the proportion of elderly citizens in western European countries continues to rise, these figures can be expected to increase.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Venous leg ulcers - pathological mechanism of development</HEADING>
<P>The precise pathological mechanism of development of venous ulcers is contentious (<LINK REF="REF-Valencia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valencia 2001</LINK>), although in most cases the root cause can be traced back to the inefficient activity of the calf muscle 'pump' (<LINK REF="REF-Orsted-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orsted 2001</LINK>), and malfunctioning valves in the veins of the lower leg (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>). These lead to venous hypertension and, subsequently, chronic venous insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>), the most severe stage of which is marked by the venous leg ulcer (<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>). Indeed, venous ulceration has been allocated to the most advanced categories (C5 and C6) of the CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology) classification system (<LINK REF="REF-Lyseng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyseng 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Venous disease is characterised by ambulatory venous hypertension (abnormally sustained elevation of the venous pressure upon walking) (<LINK REF="REF-Araujo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araujo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2004</LINK>). Normally, blood in the leg veins is propelled to the heart by the activity of the calf muscle pump. The pump is activated by walking and, when operating efficiently, the venous pressure should drop substantially upon ambulation (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ambulatory venous hypertension occurs when a vital component of the calf muscle pump - the valves in the veins of the lower leg - malfunction; this is otherwise known as venous valvular incompetence (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2004</LINK>). Back flow (reflux) of blood from the deep veins in the leg occurs, resulting in increased hydrostatic pressure in the superficial veins, which is then transmitted to the capillaries. The increase in intra-capillary pressure is known as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>). In the US, approximately one million of the seven million people with CVI develop venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Araujo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araujo 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Venous hypertension causes the single-celled capillary walls to become stretched, resulting in an increase in the permeability of the venous wall. This in turn provokes the leakage of fluid, containing plasma protein deposits and red blood cells, into the tissues and skin. This induces pericapillary oedema, overloading of the lymphatic network, and inhibits perfusion of oxygen and nutrients to skin cells. Such 'microcirculatory dysfunction' leads to capillary damage, tissue destruction and ultimately, venous ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstantinos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstantinos 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Struckmann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Struckmann 1999</LINK> has also suggested that capillary blocking by trapped white blood cells, which initiates an inflammatory response, is a prominent factor in ulcer development. Indeed, a recent review suggested that the trapping and activation of white blood cells (leukocytes) was the major factor associated with the inflammatory reaction that may ultimately lead to ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Pascarella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascarella 2005</LINK>). This hypothesis has become increasingly popular since the discovery that shortage of oxygen is not the primary cause of venous ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Pascarella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascarella 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treating venous leg ulcers</HEADING>
<P>Several authors have summarised the evidence for existing therapies that have been proven to be, or are likely to be, therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of venous ulceration. These interventions include multilayer elastic compression bandaging, limb elevation, and surgical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Araujo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araujo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2009</LINK>). There has also been considerable interest in the role of pharmacological agents to address the microcirculatory dysfunction that gives rise to venous ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Coleridge_x002d_Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge-Smith 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascarella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascarella 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of drugs have been implicated as adjunctive therapies in leg ulcer treatment; including aspirin, sulodexide, flavonoids, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and systemic mesoglycan (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2006</LINK>). Additionally, a Cochrane Review found pentoxifylline to be an effective adjunct in venous leg ulcer healing, both in the presence and absence of compression therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jull-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jull 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Araujo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araujo 2003</LINK>, however, stated that most of these drugs are efficacious only when used in conjunction with multilayer compression bandaging. Despite ongoing efforts to develop effective pharmacological agents, the nucleus of venous ulcer treatment continues to be physical in nature.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-05 11:16:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Flavonoids, first isolated in the 1930s, are a large and diverse family of naturally-occurring compounds. Flavonoid compounds occur in a variety of plant-based foods and beverages, including cocoas, chocolates, teas and red wines (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerstone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerstone 2000</LINK>). They are categorised into six subclasses according to their chemical structure (flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavonones, catechins and anthocyanidins)(<LINK REF="REF-Manach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manach 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most flavonoids are administered orally, however, they can also be administered in the form of a cream (<LINK REF="REF-Tajana-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tajana 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasanoglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasanoglu 2001</LINK>), or intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2004</LINK>). Micronised Purified Flavonoid Fraction (MPFF) is the most extensively studied flavonoid formulation, and has been reported to demonstrate efficacy in venous ulcer healing (<LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shephard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shephard 2002</LINK>). Another two flavonoid preparations which have been associated with the treatment of venous ulceration are hydroxyethylrutosides (HR), also known as troxerutin, and Pycnogenol® (<LINK REF="STD-Stegmann-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stegmann 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 2005</LINK>). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Pycnogenol® in reducing the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Arcangeli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arcangeli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrassi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrassi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riccioni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riccioni 2004</LINK>). The other flavonoid compounds which have been investigated for their anti-ulcer activities are catechins and epicatechins which have been tested in mice (<LINK REF="REF-Sannomiya-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sannomiya 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-05 16:31:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Flavonoids have been widely used in the management of the symptoms of venous disease for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Coleridge_x002d_Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge-Smith 2003</LINK>). They can address certain microcirculatory deficiencies involved in ulcer pathophysiology. These include decreasing leukocyte (white blood cell) adhesion and free radical formation; decreasing the permeability and fragility of the vein valves and venous wall (and therefore decreasing abnormal leakage in the lower limbs); and increasing venous flow (<LINK REF="REF-Pascarella-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascarella 2005</LINK>). They cannot, however, attack the underlying cause of venous hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2004</LINK>). MPFF, marketed as Daflon® 500 mg, has been strongly implicated in the treatment of venous ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Struckmann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Struckmann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lyseng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyseng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katsenis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsenis 2005</LINK>), although its mode of efficacy is incompletely understood (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>An industry-sponsored meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was previously undertaken by <LINK REF="REF-Coleridge_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge-Smith 2005</LINK> to assess the effects of MPFF (Daflon® 500mg) in the treatment of venous leg ulcers.

<P>Another systematic review that was published on the Cochrane Library assessed the effectiveness of phlebotonics for venous insufficiency (including flavonoids and venous leg ulcers) (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Zapata-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Zapata 2005</LINK>); this review included two trials of phlebotonics for venous ulceration (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz_x002d_Ehrenburg-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz-Ehrenburg 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>).

<P>For this review two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, as recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance). Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study. We discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure' (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-03-05 16:50:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in the review were combined by narrative overview with a quantitative summary of the results of similar trials, where appropriate. For each trial with dichotomous outcomes, e.g. were ulcers healed? (yes or no), a risk ratio (RR) of healing with 95% CIs was calculated. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi² and I² tests (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I² indicates the percentage of between-study variation explained by true heterogeneity rather than chance effect. In the absence of significant heterogeneity (i.e. where I² was less than 25%), we used a fixed-effect model when combining studies. Where heterogeneity was moderate (i.e. I² was between 25% and 75%), we used a random-effects model. If statistical heterogeneity was considerable (i.e. I² was greater than 75%), and there was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity - or where there was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity alone - then pooling was not attempted, and a narrative overview was presented instead.</P>
<P>Mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous data (e.g. change in ulcer surface area). Where outcomes for continuous variables were presented without confidence intervals, standard deviations, or some measure of the precision of the result, the data were entered into the analysis table and not used in data pooling. We assessed the possibility of pooling studies, for which some measure of the precision of the result was available.</P>
<P>We intended to investigate publication bias by using a funnel plot, however, this was not possible because an insufficient number of trials was included in the review. Funnel plots have been shown to be unhelpful in reviews that have only a small number of included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2000</LINK>). Similarly, sensitivity analyses were not possible, due to the small number of included studies.</P>

<P>When the French pharmaceutical company Servier Internationale (manufacturers of MPFF preparation Daflon® 500 mg) was contacted it provided detailed unpublished data from two trials of MPFF (<LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>). No other information was forthcoming from any other manufacturers. We contacted the lead author of two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz_x002d_Ehrenburg-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz-Ehrenburg 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz_x002d_Ehrenburg-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz-Ehrenburg 1993b</LINK>), as he had reported both trials in a single publication that was only an extended abstract and contained limited information. The author replied that the abstract had not been published as a full paper, and he had no additional data available. Finally, the results of another included trial were only available as a conference abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 1996</LINK>). No contact details could be found for any of its authors, so no additional data were identified.</P>
<P>The trials were published between 1986 and 2004. Five trials investigated MPFF, four trials investigated hydroxyethylrutosides (HR), and no other trials involving other flavonoid preparations that met the inclusion criteria were identified. All flavonoid interventions were delivered orally. All but one of the MPFF trials had an intervention duration of six months: the intervention duration of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK> was only two months, because physicians wished to have access to skin grafting for those patients who still had unhealed ulcers after this time. The trials investigating the efficacy of HR ranged from six weeks to three months.</P>
<P>In total, 552 patients received a flavonoid agent in conjunction with standard therapy (compression bandaging and local therapy), and 523 patients received standard therapy alone, or standard therapy with placebo. Most studies used similar criteria for diagnosis of venous leg ulceration except for <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>, which was a translated paper and classified the ulcers as venous trophic ulcers.</P>

<P>In judging the risk of bias for selective reporting, we were unable to assess the trial protocols, and, therefore, assessed the studies on the basis of the pre-specified outcome measures reported in the methods section of the trial reports.

<P>All five studies provided data for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>), and the data were sufficiently homogenous clinically to be used in a quantitative synthesis<I>. </I>All were parallel group RCTs investigating ulcer healing in adults receiving two 500 mg tablets of MPFF a day in addition to standard treatment. All authors reported using similar patient inclusion criteria and standardised local therapy.</P>
<P>Pooling of the five trials using a random-effects model (I² = 60%) showed a statistically significant effect in favour of MPFF (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 60%) across studies was probably due to one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>), in which the effect was in the opposite direction to that in the other four studies.<SUP> </SUP>It should be noted that <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK> was at low risk of bias and individually did not demonstrate any benefit in favour of MPFF; the other four trials were all at unclear risk of bias overall.</P>
<P>
<B>1.2 Change in ulcer surface area (cm²)</B>
</P>
<P>There was substantial variability in the reporting of this outcome across the five studies that investigated MPFF. Two studies did not provide any measure of the precision of the estimates (<LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was judged to be inappropriate to pool two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK> the mean ulcer area at baseline differed significantly between the MPFF group (4.76 cm²) and the control group (8.01 cm²). This has important consequences for the validity of the trial's results. A comparison of end scores would favour the MPFF group (0.85 cm²) over the control group (2.53 cm²), however, comparison of change in ulcer area would favour the control group (5.48 cm² versus 3.91 cm²). A comparison of percentage reduction from baseline would again change the results, with the MPFF group showing a greater reduction of 82.1% compared to 68.4% in the control group. In a trial with poor comparability of wound area at baseline, and when the outcome is based on change in wound area, the result can only be considered valid where percentage area change and absolute area change are in the same direction (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>). Therefore, we reported the mean change in ulcer surface area separately for the two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK> reported that the mean difference (MD) between the two groups was statistically significant in favour of MPFF (MD 0.93; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.65) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK> the difference was not significant (MD -1.57; 95% CI -3.42 to 0.28) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We could not present the comparisons in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK> graphically as area change from baseline because the standard deviation for changes from baseline values was not available. Since ulcer surface area was comparable between treatment groups at baseline, and because this was the most rigorous trial, we felt it was appropriate to illustrate graphically the difference in ulcer surface area between treatment groups at trial end (after six months of treatment) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). At trial end, the mean difference in ulcer surface area between the two groups was not significant (MD 0.22; 95% CI -1.84 to 2.28).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK> reported a greater reduction in ulcer area in the MPFF group compared to the control group (80% and 65% respectively). While <LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK> presented mean baseline ulcer surface areas for both groups, no data at endpoint were presented in the report.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK> did not report this outcome. All the other trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK> reported significantly faster healing time with MPFF. In <LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>, the time to achieve healing was reported to be shorter in the MPFF group than in the placebo group, but no other data were provided. In <LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK>, the mean healing time was 137 days for the MPFF group compared to 166 days for the control group, while in <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>, the median healing time was 90 days in the MPFF group versus 119 days in the control group.

</P>
<P>Only two of the five included studies on MPFF addressed cost (<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK> reported that MPFF, in addition to standard therapy, was more effective and cheaper than standard therapy alone. The cost effectiveness ratio (cost per healed ulcer) in the MPFF group was EUR1026.2 compared with EUR 1871.8 in the control group. In the analysis, a social point of view was chosen and costs and consequences of the therapy in the two groups were taken into account. Costs covered direct medical costs, such as drugs, dressings, laboratory tests, hospitalisation caused by the deterioration of ulceration and adverse events, while effectiveness was measured by the number of patients healed. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK> concluded that it was more expensive to treat with MPFF and standard therapy than standard therapy alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for MPFF group for the additional healing of another ulcer was RUB 10906.2, in comparison with standard therapy alone.</P>
<P>
<B>1.7 Hospitalisation</B>
</P>
<P>Four of the five trials reported on hospitalisation. <LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference in duration of time in hospital between the MPFF group (7.5 days) and the control group (14.5 days). Three trials provided data on the number of patients hospitalised, which we pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).

<P>
<B>1.8 Pain and mobility</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials reported no significant difference in severity and reduction of pain between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>). Two other trials did not assess pain specifically (<LINK REF="STD-Guilhou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Guilhou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference between groups for the presence of night cramps and painful sensations.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Roztocil-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Roztocil 2002</LINK> reported that no adverse events were observed in the trial, while <LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK> did not report on this outcome. Significantly, the pooled analysis of three trials showed that 52% more participants in the MPFF group experienced adverse events compared to participants in the control group (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.30) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Adverse events were reported to be mild to moderate across studies. The most common events were skin changes (including eczema), gastrointestinal disturbances (including diarrhoea) and hypertension.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-07 10:27:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Nine RCTs involving 1075 patients were included in this review. Unlike the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Coleridge_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleridge-Smith 2005</LINK>), which included only trials on micronised purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF), this review considered all flavonoid preparations that have been used for venous leg ulcers. Beside MPFF, two other flavonoid preparations, namely hydroxyethylrutosides (HR) and Pycogenol® have been assessed for their effects on leg ulcers, however, one trial on Pycogenol® was excluded because it was not an RCT(<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the overall estimate on the number of healed ulcers showed significant effects of flavonoids - both MPFF and HR - on ulcer leg healing, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. The meta-analysis result was not based on data from all trials. Several trials either did not report on the outcome of interest, or did not provide sufficient data to allow pooling of estimates. Additionally, pooling of data was from trials with a limited number of patients that were either at high risk of bias or had an unclear risk of bias regarding method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and handling of missing data.</P>
<P>Trials which showed significant effects in favour of the MPFF group were judged either to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the bias domains of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, or did not provide sufficient information to allow us to assess the risk of bias. In contrast, the trial which was considered to be at low risk of bias showed no significant difference in effects between MPFF and control groups. There is evidence to show that studies that are inadequately concealed and not blinded can lead to overestimation of treatment effects by up to 41% and 17% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most rigorously conducted trial with the largest sample size was unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>). This raises the possibility of publication bias, as its result was not favourable for flavonoids. There is substantial evidence that studies with significant or favourable results are more likely to be published than those with non-significant or unfavourable results (<LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2000</LINK>), and, therefore, the possibility of publication bias in this review cannot be dismissed. Even though we have undertaken extensive searches for published material, we still could not exclude the possibility that studies with negative findings remain unpublished. We did not generate a funnel plot to assess the degree of publication bias in this systematic review, because of the small number of included studies. Publication bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present findings. The small number of trials identified, and the generally low methodological quality of these trials, also prevented us from performing a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the results of the review by excluding trials with a high risk of bias from the analysis.</P>
<P>Three out of four trials investigating HR reported on the number of completely healed ulcers, with one study demonstrating a significant effect in favour of HR (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 1996</LINK>). The pooled estimate of these three trials showed that more ulcers healed in the HR group than the control group. This finding should also be interpreted with caution, as all these trials had unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. A previous review of oedema protective drugs (including HR) concluded that such agents "are probably beneficial for patients with acute venous ulcers in addition to compression therapy" (<LINK REF="REF-Diehm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 1996</LINK>), however, more research is needed to confirm the efficacy of HR.</P>
<P>The quality of reporting of secondary outcomes in included studies was varied; secondary outcomes of interest were not reported in all trials. Overall, painful sensations were less frequently experienced among groups receiving flavonoids. In contrast, adverse events were reported more often in those treated with flavonoids, although very few severe events were observed that could be related to treatment. More research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of flavonoids; two of the trials conducted economic evaluations, but their findings on cost were contradictory and hence, inconclusive.</P>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-04-25 11:40:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>The shortcomings of the nine trials are outlined in the risk of bias section of the results. Overall, the quality of reporting was poor. Many trials omitted important methodological information, such as method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of outcomes, which are essential for assessing risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK> showed that studies which are not randomised and not blinded can lead to overestimation of treatment effects. Only two studies included in the review were judged to have adequate randomisation and to be sufficiently blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Glinski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Glinski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>), and only one trial was considered to have adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>). Thus, it is likely that bias due to lack of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding have exaggerated the treatment effect obtained in this review. Additionally, in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Saveljev-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saveljev 2002</LINK>), the loss to follow-up was high for the control group 21% (13/62) compared with 8% (5/62) in the MPFF group. Since missing data in the study were considered and analysed as "ulcer not healed," this has overestimated the treatment effect in favour of the flavonoids. One unpublished study included in the review which was clearly the most rigorously conducted and thus has high internal validity compared to all other studies did not show any benefit in favour of the flavonoids (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-05 13:43:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>At present, there is some evidence of the beneficial effects of flavonoids (both micronised purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) and hydroxyethylrutosides (HR)) for venous leg ulcers from trials that we judged to be suffering from some degree of bias. Since there is at least one rigorously-conducted unpublished trial that did not show any evidence of beneficial effects with MPFF, we concluded that the overall evidence is not adequate to support the use of flavonoids in practice. There is some evidence that MPFF caused significantly more adverse events than control treatments, however, these adverse events were reported to be mild to moderate, including events such as skin changes (including eczema) and gastrointestinal disturbances (including diarrhoea).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-05 13:44:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Based on the assessment of the included trials, which were small and had methodological problems, we recommend that future trials will require:</P>
<P>1.  participant numbers that ensure sufficient statistical power to detect true treatment effects;<BR/>2.  use of true randomisation with allocation concealment (e.g. computer-generated codes);<BR/>3.  measures to help ensure comparability of treatments at baseline (e.g. stratification for ulcer size);<BR/>4.  blinded outcome assessment;<BR/>5.  use of objective outcome measurement (e.g. ulcer area, number of wounds completely healed in a pre-specified time period); and<BR/>6.  use of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials should be adequately reported. The CONSORT 2010 statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>) lists 25 items that need to be reported to show readers whether or not a trial is likely to produce valid and reliable results. Further research into the relationship of flavonoids and venous ulcer healing needs to be reported in accordance with this guideline.</P>

<P>Comment: there was significant baseline difference between the 2 groups. Even though the trialists reported that adjustment was made to take account of the differences, it was not clear how the calculation was done.
