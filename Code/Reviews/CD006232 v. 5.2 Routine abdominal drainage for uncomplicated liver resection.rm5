<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is no evidence to support routine drain use after liver resections</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Use of abdominal drainage after elective liver resections is controversial. The rationale of inserting a drain in the abdomen is to prevent fluid collections in the abdomen and to detect post-operative bleeding and bile leak. The review on five clinical trials with 465 patients could present no evidence to support drain use. However, the confidence intervals are wide, and reduced infective and chest complication rate of not draining may have been overlooked. With respect to wound infection, the likelihood of getting an infection is almost doubled if suction drain is applied, compared to no drain at all. More randomised trials are desirable as it would give further insights to the implications of the use of drains with respect to specific patient-groups and types of operations. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The main reasons for inserting a drain after elective liver resections are (i) prevention of sub-phrenic or sub-hepatic fluid collection; (ii) identification and monitoring of post-operative bleeding; (iii) identification and drainage of any bile leak; and (iv) prevent the accumulation of ascitic fluid in cirrhotics. However, there are reports that drain use increases the complication rates.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage in elective liver resections.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)</I> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>, and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> until March 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised trials comparing abdominal drainage and no drainage in adults undergoing elective liver resection. We also included randomised trials comparing different types of drain in adults undergoing elective liver resection.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay from each trial. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using the Cochrane Collaboration statistical software RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (based on intention-to-treat analysis) by combining the trial data sets using fixed-effect model or random-effects model, as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>
<B>Drain versus no drain</B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>We included five trials with 465 patients randomised: 234 to the drain group and 231 to the no drain group. Three of the five trials were of high methodological quality. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcomes (mortality, intra-abdominal collections requiring re-operation, infected intra-abdominal collections, wound infection, ascitic leak, and hospital stay, when the random-effects model was adopted.</P>
<P>
<B>Open drain versus closed drain</B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>One randomised clinical trial of low methodological quality comparing open with closed drainage (186 patients) showed a lower incidence of infected intra-abdominal collections, chest complications, and hospital stay in the closed drain group.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 14:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Elective liver resection is performed mainly for benign and malignant liver tumours (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>). The malignant tumours include primary liver cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma), but also metastases from malignancies of other organs (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>). More than 1000 elective liver resections are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone (<LINK REF="REF-HES-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2005</LINK>). Although every liver resection is considered major surgery, only resection of three or more segments is a major liver resection (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, after liver resection, a prophylactic drain is placed in the sub-phrenic space close to the resection surface (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1997</LINK>). The main reasons for inserting a drain after hepato-biliary surgery are (i) prevention of sub-phrenic or sub-hepatic fluid collection, (ii) identification and monitoring of post-operative bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bona-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bona 1994</LINK>), (iii) identification and drainage of any bile leak (<LINK REF="REF-Sarr-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bona-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bona 1994</LINK>), and (iv) prevent the accumulation of ascitic fluid (which is common after resection of cirrhotic liver, particularly in those patients with portal hypertension) (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgical drains may either be open or closed. An open drain is when an artificial conduit is left in the wound to allow drainage of fluids to the exterior (eg, Penrose drain; Yeates drain). Closed drains may either be suction drains (eg, Redon drain) or passive (gravity assisted) drains (eg, Robinson drain).</P>
<P>Of the trials carried out on drainage after liver surgery, there is conflicting evidence as to whether drains are beneficial. Some authors found that using a drain reduced the ascitic leak (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>), whereas others found that there was no significant difference in the complication rates whether a drain is used or not (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>). Other authors suggested that using drainage increased the complications including chest infection (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>), wound infection (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>), sub-phrenic collections (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>), and ascitic leak (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). The drain did not detect any of the episodes of the bile leaks and intra-abdominal bleeding in a trial on the use of drain in liver resections (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). Drain-site infection is also a complication of using a drain occurring in between 1.7% to 7.7% of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). Another feared complication of using a drain is the potential of cancer seeding along the drain tract (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Thus, the use of abdominal drain in liver resections is a controversial issue. There has been no meta-analysis or systematic review comparing routine abdominal drainage versus no abdominal drainage in uncomplicated liver resections.</P>

<P>Due to the risk of biased overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with inadequate methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>), we looked at the influence of methodological quality of the trials on the results by evaluating the reported randomisation and follow-up procedures in each trial. If information was not available in the published trial, we attempted to contact the authors in order to assess the trials correctly. We assessed generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). We used the software package RevMan 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. We used the random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). In case of discrepancy between the two models both results were to be reported. Heterogeneity was explored by chi-squared test with significance set at P value 0.10, and the quantity of heterogeneity was measured by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). For continuous variables, we calculated the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval.</P>
<P>The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>). In the case of 'zero-event' trials, we performed a sensitivity analysis with and without empirical continuity correction factors as suggested by Sweeting et al (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>). We also reported the risk difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We performed the following subgroup analyses:<BR/>- trials with high- compared to trials with low-methodological quality.<BR/>- drainage in major liver resection compared to minor liver resections.<BR/>- liver resection in cirrhotic livers compared to non-cirrhotic livers.<BR/>- open compared to closed drains.<BR/>- suction compared to closed passive drains.<BR/>- trials that use routine antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those that do not use routine antibiotic prophylaxis.</P>
<P>In addition to the planned sub-group analyses, we performed a subgroup analysis of patients with chronic liver disease.</P>
<P>For the sub-group analyses, we used the fixed-effect model if the heterogeneity, as measured by Higgins' I<SUP>2,</SUP>, was &lt;= 25% and we used the random-effects model if I<SUP>2</SUP> was &gt; 25%.</P>

We excluded 89 duplicates and 265 clearly irrelevant references through reading abstracts. Thus, there were no references left to be listed in the 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' table. Nine references were retrieved for further assessment. No references were identified through scanning reference lists of the identified randomised trials. No publication was rejected after obtaining the full text article. There were three publications on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>) and two publications on another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In this systematic review we have found no evidence to support the routine use of abdominal drains in uncomplicated liver resections. </P>
<P>One of the main reasons for the insertion of a drain is to prevent intra-abdominal collections. The rate of intra-abdominal collections requiring surgical drainage (re-operation) was higher in the drain group (2.1%) compared with the no drain group (0.9%). This difference was not statistically significant. Intra-abdominal collections treated by drain insertion under radiological control were lower in the drain group (3.4%) than in the no drain group (5.6%), but this was not statistically significant. Four of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2006</LINK>) comparing drain and no drain performed routine ultrasound in the first week. The fifth trial performed ultrasound only in symptomatic patients (fever, unexplained leukocytosis, persistent ileus, persistent hiccups, and unexplained hyperbilirubinaemia) with potential intra-abdominal collections (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>), all the collections were aspirated. In the other trials, the asymptomatic collections were just observed and the symptomatic collections were treated. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2006</LINK>) reported the total number of collections detected by the ultrasound irrespective of whether they were symptomatic or not. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of collections identified by routine ultrasound between the two groups (drain group 36.4% versus no drain group 37.1%). Thus, currently, there is no evidence that drains prevent intra-abdominal collections. On the other hand, the rate of infected intra-abdominal collections in the drain group (4.7%) was more than double the rate in the no drain group (2.2%). This difference was not significant due to the small numbers of infected intra-abdominal collections involved. However, this difference in the rate of infected collections could explain the difference in the rate of intervention to treat the collections. More patients in the drain group underwent surgical drainage of intra-abdominal collections than in the no drain group as opposed to fewer patients in the drain group being treated by drain insertion than in the no drain group.</P>
<P>Other reasons for use of drains are the identification and monitoring of intra-abdominal bleeding and the identification and drainage of any bile leak. If these are not detected, they can be potentially fatal by causing hypovolaemia and peritonitis, respectively. However, the mortality was not significantly different between the drain and the no drain groups. Among all the included trials, only one patient required re-operation for bleeding. This was in the drain group and it was not identified by the drain. Post-operative bile leakage was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>), there was no post-operative bile leakage in either group. In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>), there were two cases of post-operative bile leakage in the drain group. The drain did not help in the identification of bile leakage in either of these cases. One case of bile leak was identified at laparotomy for abdominal sepsis, and the other was identified on ultrasound performed for abdominal sepsis. The second patient was treated with an ultrasound guided drainage. Thus, bleeding and bile leakage requiring emergency surgical or radiological interventions are rare after hepatic resection, and prophylactic drains do not help in the identification or management of these complications.<BR/> <BR/>Another reason for drain use is to prevent the accumulation of ascitic fluid that may lead to ascitic leak and wound dehiscence. There was a significantly higher rate of ascitic leak in the drain group compared to the no drain group. However, this became insignificant when the random-effects model was used. One explanation for the heterogeneity observed between the trials is the potentially different definitions used by different authors to record ascitic leak. In the absence of definitions in the reports, the significance of the differences in leak rates is impossible to determine. Another reason for variation between the trials could be the different numbers of cirrhotic patients in each trial as ascites occurs mainly after liver resection in cirrhosis. A sub-group analysis revealed no significant difference in the ascitic leak rate between the drain group and the no drain group of patients with cirrhotic livers. Wound dehiscence was also not significantly different between the drain and no drain groups (0.6% versus 1.2%).</P>
<P>Critics of drains allege that drains predispose to infection and chest complications. There was no significant difference in the wound infection rate between drain group (11.5%) and no drain group (6.8%). On including only trials in which suction drains were used, the wound infection rate was statistically significantly higher in the drain group (12.8%) than in the no drain group (5.8%). The possible reason for this is the exclusion of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>), which used a passive drain and in which the infection rate was lower in the drain group than in the no drain group. There were no randomised trials performing a direct comparison between closed passive drain and a suction drain to clarify whether the observation on wound infection during the sub-group analysis was due to real effect. There was no significant difference in the chest infection rate between the drain group (4.7%) and the no drain group (3.5%) nor the incidence of other respiratory complications. Thus, although the infective complications and chest complications were higher in the drain group, the differences were not significantly different except for wound infection when only suction drains were included for analysis. </P>
<P>Other complications, such as re-operations and biliary fistula, were also similar in both groups. As far as tumour seeding along the drain tract was concerned, the follow-up period in some trials was only until discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>), which is not sufficiently long to detect this complication. </P>
<P>Although the overall mean hospital stay was higher in the drain group (12.8 days) than in the no drain group (11.8 days), the meta-analysis revealed a shorter hospital stay in the drain group than in the no drain group (WMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.28). This is because of the different weight given to the different trials based on their standard deviations (greater weight to trials with lower standard deviation). An important observation on the forest plot in the fixed-effect model was that one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2006</LINK>) contributed to 99.2% of the weight because of the low standard deviation in the trial. The mean hospital stay of the groups in the trial was 8.1 days and 8.5 days, and the standard deviations were 0.4 days and 0.3 days, respectively for the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2006</LINK>). Because of this low standard deviation, the clinically non-distinguishable stays of 8.1 days and 8.5 days became statistically significant. However, when the random-effects model was adopted, the difference was not statistically significant. The difference was less than half a day and could be even spurious, arising out of mathematical calculations if hospital stay was calculated as the number of completed days. In total, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belghiti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belghiti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2006</LINK>) report a difference in hospital stay of less than half a day. One trial with 104 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>) reported a clinically and statistically significant higher hospital stay in the drain group (19 days  15.9) than no drain group (12.5 days  7.9). The only trial comparing passive (closed) drain and no drain (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>) found a clinically and statistically significant lower hospital stay in the drain group (10 days  3) than the no drain group (14 days  4). This trial included minor resections in cirrhotic patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 2004</LINK>). Because of the combination of these two factors and the inclusion of specific trials for sub-group analyses, the hospital stay was statistically significantly different between the groups in the various sub-group analyses performed, and hence much importance should not be attached to this.</P>
<P>The only trial comparing open and closed drain (<LINK REF="STD-Uetsuji-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Uetsuji 1997</LINK>) has demonstrated benefit in the closed drain group with regards to infected intra-abdominal collections, chest complications other than chest infection, and hospital stay. Currently, closed drain is more popular than the open drain with all the trials comparing drain and no drain using closed drains. The current emphasis is on whether drains should be used or not, and not on whether closed drain is preferable to open drain.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support routine drain use after liver resections. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for more randomised trials evaluating different types of drains versus no drains with blinded assessment of outcomes. Based on one trial with high risk of bias, the best drain type seems to be the suction drain. Future randomised trials ought to be large and should assess patient important outcomes. These trials should also adopt blinded outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Further trials to assess the use of drain in specific groups of patients (cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic patients) and in specific types of liver resections (major resections or minor resections) are also necessary.</P>
<P>Trials need to be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT Statement (www.consort-statement.org/).</P>
