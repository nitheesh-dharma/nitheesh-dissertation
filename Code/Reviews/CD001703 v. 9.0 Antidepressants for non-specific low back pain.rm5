<TITLE>Antidepressants for non-specific low-back pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-27 09:19:28 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-back pain is a common condition affecting up to 80% of adults over their lifetime. In the vast majority of cases, low-back pain has no identifiable cause and is termed "non-specific".</P>
<P>Low-back pain is usually benign and self-limiting. It generally resolves in six weeks, with or without treatment.</P>
<P>However, up to 30% of individuals who report low-back pain go on to have recurrent or persistent symptoms. As a result, low-back pain is one of the most common reasons for medical visits and it results in huge economic losses across developed nations because of reduced productivity, work absence and early retirement.</P>
<P>Antidepressants are a common treatment for low-back pain. Physicians prescribe them to patients with back pain for three main reasons: to provide pain relief, help with sleep and reduce depression. However, the prescription of antidepressants as a treatment for back pain remains controversial because of conflicting scientific evidence.</P>
<P>This updated review evaluated whether antidepressants are beneficial in the management of non-specific low-back pain. We identified ten studies which compared antidepressants to a placebo (an inactive substance that has no treatment value). All patients in these studies had low-back pain as a primary complaint and some participants also had symptoms of depression.</P>
<P>We looked at the results of individual studies and also combined the results of several studies in larger analyses.</P>
<P>The review could find no convincing evidence that antidepressants relieve back pain or depression more effectively than placebo. Antidepressants did not result in any other apparent benefits in the treatment of back pain.</P>
<P>Antidepressants did cause side-effects, however, adequate information about these was not provided in the trials.</P>
<P>Patients with significant depression should not avoid antidepressants based on this review, as they continue to play an important role in the treatment of clinical depression. There is also evidence that antidepressants can help patients with other specific types of pain.</P>
<P>The review cautions that existing studies do not provide adequate evidence regarding antidepressants for low-back pain. There is a need for larger and more sophisticated studies to confirm the conclusions of this review. In the meantime, antidepressants should be regarded as an unproven treatment for non-specific low-back pain.</P>

<P>The aim of this review was to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>

<P>Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (to November 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2008, Issue 4, and previous systematic reviews.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-02-27 09:00:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressant medication and placebo for patients with non-specific low-back pain and used at least one clinically relevant outcome measure.</P>

<P>Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, and the effect of antidepressant type on pain.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-02 10:19:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials that compared antidepressants with placebo were included in this review. The pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief (six trials (one trial with two treatment arms and a second trial with 3 treatment arms); standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.25 to 0.17)) or depression (two trials; SMD 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.40)) between antidepressant and placebo treatments. The qualitative analyses found conflicting evidence on the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in chronic low-back pain, and no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce depression in chronic low-back pain patients. Two pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief between different types of antidepressants and placebo. Our findings were not altered by the sensitivity analyses, which varied the risk of bias allowed for inclusion in the meta-analyses to allow data from additional trials to be examined.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no clear evidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain should not be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for their use in other forms of chronic pain.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-27 09:25:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-back pain is a major health problem in developed countries worldwide and a primary cause of medical expense, absenteeism and disability. Although low-back pain is usually a benign and self-limiting disease that improves spontaneously over time (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1987</LINK>), a wide range of therapeutic interventions are available for the treatment of this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherkin 2003</LINK>). Drug therapy is one of the many possible treatments available for symptom relief in patients with low-back pain. In particular, antidepressant medication has been used in the management of patients with low-back pain for many decades.</P>
<P>There are three key reasons for using antidepressants in the treatment of low-back pain. First, chronic low-back pain patients commonly present with depression, and treatment with antidepressants may elevate mood and increase pain tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mic_x00f3_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micó 2006</LINK>). The second reason for the use of antidepressants in chronic low-back pain patients is their supposed analgesic action, which may occur at lower doses than their antidepressant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mic_x00f3_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micó 2006</LINK>). Third, antidepressant drugs (primarily tricyclic antidepressants) are sedating, and it has been suggested that part of their value for managing chronic pain syndromes may be to improve sleep in those who experience insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1996</LINK>). To obtain these specific effects in the management of chronic pain, different classes of antidepressants and treatment doses are used.</P>
<P>However, the use of antidepressants for low-back pain is controversial. There is no clear message from recent systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>) and antidepressants are not recommended in most clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2001</LINK>). Nevertheless, two surveys have been conducted in the United States of America, which show that up to 23% of primary care physicians prescribe antidepressants for low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-DiIorio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiIorio 2000</LINK>), and 2%, 7% and 13% of visits for low-back pain to primary care physicians, neurologists and rheumatologists respectively involve the prescription of antidepressant mediation (<LINK REF="REF-Broadhead-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadhead 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>While our previous systematic review concluded that there is no clear evidence that antidepressants are effective in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 2008</LINK>), trials were identified that were not included in the last review, so an updated review of the literature is indicated.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-19 12:13:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this systematic review were to:<BR/>(i) assess whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain,<BR/>(ii) update previous systematic reviews with the latest evidence, and<BR/>(iii) clarify the conflicting findings between our review and previous systematic reviews.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-01-19 14:35:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adult subjects with non-specific low-back pain (defined as pain localised below the scapulae and above the cleft of the buttocks) with or without radiation and with or without leg pain were included. Studies that recruited participants with somatic or radicular (neuropathic) pain, or both, were included. We excluded trials that recruited subjects with low-back pain and specific pathological entities, such as infection, neoplasm, metastasis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis or fractures. In addition, studies that investigated the effect of antidepressant medication on depression, and selected patients based on a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, even though some patients also had chronic low-back pain, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any type of antidepressant (versus placebo) was included, i.e. tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mono-amine oxidase inhibitors and 'atypical' antidepressants.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Studies were included that used at least one of five primary outcome measures; (a) pain intensity, measured on a visual analog or numerical scale, (b) overall improvement, proportion of patients recovered or improved according to a dichotomised overall assessment of the clinical state by the patient themselves or an assessor, (c) functional status, expressed on a back pain-specific scale (e.g. Roland Morris and Oswestry Disability Questionnaires) or a more generic scale (e.g. Sickness Impact Profile Scale), (d) return to work, measured as the number of days of sick leave or the proportion of patients returned to work, and (e) depression (or another behavioral outcome). Physiological outcomes (e.g. range of motion, spinal flexibility, degrees of straight leg raising or muscle strength) and generic functional status (e.g. SF-36, Nottingham Health Profile, Sickness Impact Profile) were considered secondary outcomes. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2009-02-27 09:29:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To identify relevant trials for this review, computer-aided searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were performed up to November 2008. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4) was screened for additional trials, and references of relevant reviews and identified trials were checked. Trials published in English, Dutch, French and German were included, as the authors of the current review were able to read and understand these languages.</P>
<P>We used the search strategy recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>: MEDLINE) (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). Additional search terms for antidepressants included MeSH headings: antidepressive agents (including serotonin uptake inhibitors and adrenergic uptake inhibitors), and free text words: antidepress$, amoxapine, bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, maprotiline, mianserin, paroxetine, quipazine, ritanserin, sulpiride, trazodone, tryptophan, viloxazine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, dothiepin, doxepin, imipramine, iprindole, lofepramine, nortriptyline, opipramol, protriptyline, trimipramine. A similar search strategy was used for EMBASE and PsycINFO.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently selected the trials for this systematic review and a consensus method was used to resolve disagreements concerning inclusion of randomised controlled trials. A third review author was consulted if disagreements persisted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias assessment</HEADING>
<P>To assess the risk of bias of the randomised controlled trials, the criteria (and criteria operationalisation) recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group were used (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). Eleven items reflecting the internal validity of the trials were used to assess their risk of bias, with each criterion scored as "yes", "no", or "don't know" (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Low risk of bias was defined as fulfilling six or more of the eleven quality criteria (i.e. obtaining a 'yes' score to at least six criteria). A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements. Although all authors were contacted for additional information on their trial, only one author responded to our request (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>The studies were blinded with regard to authors, institution, journal and year of publishing by an administrative assistant who was not involved in the review. Data on the characteristics of the study population, type and dose of antidepressant and placebo treatment, and study results were tabulated. A summary of these data are provided in the <I>Characteristics of included studies</I> table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Relevance</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the clinical relevance of each study based on the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). These criteria consist of five questions that relate to key factors such as patients, interventions and outcomes, and are scored as "yes", "no", or "don't know" (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). The assessment indicates whether sufficient information has been given for the user to determine the relevance of the study's results to their specific patient population.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Given sufficient data were provided, meta-analyses were performed. The results were tabulated and formally tested for homogeneity. Results were plotted as standardised mean differences (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A difference of less than zero indicated a positive effect of antidepressants. Data were pooled using a random-effects model (in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Qualitative analyses were also used to summarise the results, as not all studies could be included in the meta-analyses. The rating system recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group was used (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). It consists of four levels of scientific evidence based on the quality and the outcome of the studies:<BR/>(1) <I>
<B>strong evidence</B>
</I>: consistent findings among multiple trials with a low risk of bias<BR/>(2) <I>
<B>moderate evidence</B>
</I>: consistent findings among multiple trials with a high risk of bias and/or one trial with a low risk of bias<BR/>(3) <I>
<B>limited or conflicting evidence</B>

<P>Nine trials included patients with chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK> ) and one trial did not specify the duration of the low-back pain of the included patients (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>). All studies included low-back pain patients with a mix of clinical diagnoses, such as radicular symptoms, herniated disc or spondylolisthesis. Even though all the studies selected patients because they had back pain, one study explicitly selected low back patients with significant depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>). Four studies included a mix of patients who were depressed and patients who were not depressed (i.e. 20% depressed (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>), 40.5% history of depression (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>), 34% moderate or severe depression (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>), 47% depressed (<LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>)), three studies excluded patients with major depression (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>), and in two studies it was unclear if patients were depressed or not (<LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several types of antidepressants were investigated: tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, and 'atypical' antidepressants (e.g. aminoketone antidepressants) (<LINK REF="REF-Mir-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mir 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stahl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 1998</LINK>). Most studies evaluated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants with noradrenergic (maprotiline, nortriptyline, desipramine) (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>) or serotonergic effects (clomipramine) (<LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>), or a mix of both (amitriptyline, imipramine) (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>).

While three trials used an active placebo (i.e. preparation containing substances that mimic the side effects of antidepressants) (<LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>), the remaining trials used an inert placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>; ).<BR/>
<BR/>In most studies, patients were allowed to continue regular medication (e.g. aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>). Although opioids were usually not allowed, one study reported that analgesics were not prescribed, except on the rare occasions when they became essential, and that the only psychotropic drugs that were used were hypnotics (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>).

<P>The clinical relevance scores for each trial are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.

While most studies provided sufficient data on the patients studied (six trials), interventions/treatment settings used (10 trials) and outcomes measured and reported (six trials), information to determine if there was a clinically important effect (one trial) or whether treatment benefits outweighed the potential harms (no trials) was poorly reported. In summary, these findings indicate that while most studies were found to have moderate to high clinical relevance, the assessment of clinical relevance was limited by a paucity of data.</P>

<P>Of the seven studies with a low risk of bias that compared antidepressants with placebo, five trials reported no differences in pain between these treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>), while three studies with a low risk of bias reported a greater reduction in pain with the use of antidepressants (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>). Overall, these findings indicate that there is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in patients with chronic low-back pain.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of six small placebo-controlled trials was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>), which included studies by Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>) that had two and three intervention arms respectively. Four trials were excluded from the analysis as two studies did not provide pain intensity data (<LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>), one study did not report follow-up means and standard deviations (SDs) (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>), and one study just provided P values (which does not allow calculation of the component means and SDs) (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>). The Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test value for homogeneity of the standardised mean difference was -4.82 (df = 8; P = 0.78), indicating statistical homogeneity among the studies. The pooled analysis of trials (scores of 376 people) failed to show a difference in pain relief between antidepressants and placebo for patients with chronic non-specific low-back pain with a standardised mean difference of -0.04 (95% CI -0.25 to 0.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the four studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis, the three studies with a high risk of bias reported no differences in severity of back pain or number of analgesics taken per day (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>) and significantly more symptomatic pain relief with antidepressants (<LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>). However, the latter study by Treves and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>) reported on patients who were hospitalised and treated by intravenous infusions of antidepressants. Although there was one study with a low risk of bias that reported a greater reduction in pain with antidepressants (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>), a P value of 0.050 was interpreted as reaching statistical significance and a statistically significant effect was only found in the 'completer's analysis', not for the intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effectiveness of antidepressants versus placebo: Depression</HEADING>
<P>Six high quality trials included depression as an outcome, which was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>), Hamilton Depression Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>), and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>). There was considerable variability in the doses of antidepressant used between these trials, with Jenkins et al (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>) trialling 75 mg/day of imipramine and Goodkin and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>) using 600 mg/day of trazodone. These studies with a low risk of bias compared antidepressants with placebo and reported no differences in depression (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodkin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodkin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dickens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dickens 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>).

Neither of these studies found a significant difference in functional status with the use of antidepressants compared to placebo in patients with low-back pain.

<P>If we assumed that all validity items which were scored 'don't know' met our risk of bias criteria and consequently were scored positively, all studies would have been considered to have a low risk of bias.

If we had defined low risk of bias as meeting five or more, or seven or more criteria, the conclusions would also have been the same.</P>
<P>We also examined the inclusion of the 'positive' trial by Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>), which did not report follow-up means and SDs, in our meta-analyses. We calculated the follow-up means for pain intensity and depression from the baseline and change scores, and estimated the follow-up SDs based on the: (i) baseline SDs, (ii) ratio of the baseline means and SDs, and (iii) ratio of the follow-up means and SDs of the other RCTs included in the meta-analyses. The inclusion of Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>) in the meta-analyses for both pain and depression would not change our conclusion, that there is no difference in effect between antidepressants and placebo, and demonstrates the robustness of our findings.</P>
<P>Similarly, we examined the addition of three intervention arms from the study by Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>) in our meta-analyses. This study did not report statistically significant results for their intention-to-treat analysis, only for their 'completer's analysis'. Our meta-analyses showed that the inclusion of different intervention arms from Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>) did not change our conclusions for pain and type of antidepressant.</P>

However, these subgroup analyses could not be performed because no study explicitly included patients with acute or subacute low-back pain, administered doses that differed from the guidelines or included a long-term follow-up. We also aimed to examine work-related disability, however no studies investigated this as an outcome.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-27 11:04:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified ten randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Seven of these trials had a low risk of bias. A qualitative analysis of the trials with a low risk of bias found conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of antidepressants in the reduction of pain for chronic low-back pain patients. However, a meta-analysis of six trials failed to show a difference in pain relief between antidepressants and placebo. In addition, quantitative analyses that examined the effect of antidepressants and placebo on depression and functional status did not show a difference between treatments, neither did the evaluation of type of antidepressant (versus placebo) on pain relief. This review indicates that there is currently no clear evidence to support the prescription of antidepressants in the treatment of low-back pain. However, given the paucity of trials with a low risk of bias and large sample sizes, further research is required to confirm the effect of antidepressants on chronic low-back pain.</P>
<P>Our conclusion, that there is no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce pain, depression or functional status in patients with chronic low-back pain, may have resulted from differences in patient selection both within and between studies. Although patients were selected because they had low-back pain, there was variation in the nature and duration of patients' back pain, the percentage of patients with and without depression, and the severity of their depression. Given that a previous Cochrane review has shown that antidepressants are effective in reducing depression in patients with a variety of medical illnesses (e.g. cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2002</LINK>), future reviews that include large study populations of patients with low-back pain and severe depression may show antidepressants to be effective. This may also apply to other subgroups of the low-back pain population.</P>
<P>The frequency and seriousness of adverse effects are also important to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressants. Although adverse effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, sedation, orthostatic hypotension and tremor, were commonly reported, no serious adverse effects were documented. However, the trials were very small and not designed to evaluate adverse effects. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to evaluate the incidence of both minor and major adverse effects.</P>
<P>We performed both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and concluded that the results are robust and sufficiently conclusive. Our qualitative analyses included trials that had a lower risk of bias. Although the trials had small study populations which may have resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect clinically relevant differences in effects, statistical pooling was included in our analysis to overcome this problem and the meta-analyses consistently showed very small effect sizes of less than 0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>). Therefore, it is unlikely that an increase in sample size would have led to a major shift in the magnitude of the estimated effect or our conclusion that antidepressants are ineffective in low-back pain. Given a meta-analysis could only be performed on a subset of available trials, it is possible that statistical pooling may have also biased the results. However, we showed the robustness of our findings through our sensitivity analyses, suggesting that this was not the case.</P>
<P>Three other systematic reviews have recently investigated the efficacy of antidepressants for chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>). While there is agreement between some of the conclusions of these reviews, and between these reviews and the current review, some of their findings are conflicting. Two reviews reported antidepressants to be more effective than placebo in reducing pain severity for chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>), while our review found no consistent evidence to support this conclusion, and a fourth review concluded that their use was dependent on the type of antidepressant prescribed, with tricyclic antidepressants shown to be effective in reducing pain (unlike selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) (<LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>). In addition, only three of the four reviews (including the current review) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants to improve functional status in chronic low-back pain patients (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, although two reviews did not specifically report on the effect of antidepressants on depression, a third review reported antidepressants to be effective in reducing depression in chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>), while our review found no clear evidence for their use in patients with low-back pain and depression.</P>
<P>These conflicting conclusions may have resulted from methodological differences between reviews. Based on Jadad's decision algorithm for analysing and interpreting discordant systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1997</LINK>), the reviews were found to primarily differ in the selection criteria used and the trials that were included. Given we identified studies published up until November 2008 and included non-English trials, our review was the only one to include the study of Katz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2005</LINK>), Treves et al (<LINK REF="STD-Treves-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Treves 1991</LINK>) and Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>). Unlike Schnitzer et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>), we excluded a trial by Schreiber et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 2001a</LINK>) that did not analyse data for low-back pain patients separately, and in contrast to Salerno et al (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>), we excluded a study by Ward et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1986</LINK>) that did not specify randomisation of subjects to groups.</P>
<P>Given that three of the reviews performed a meta-analysis, the differences in conclusions can also be explained by the trials selected for statistical pooling. Salerno et al (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>) included all ten studies in their meta-analysis, while our review was limited to six trials, and Staiger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>) performed two analyses, with seven trials in the analysis of tricyclic antidepressants and five in the analysis of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Schnitzer et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schnitzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnitzer 2004</LINK>) did not perform a meta-analysis. Given Salerno et al (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>) included the study by Ward et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1986</LINK>) (which made no mention of randomisation), which showed the largest difference in effect, it is very likely that this caused an overestimation of the treatment effect. We did not include the study of Alcoff et al (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>) as only P - values were reported, the study of Pheasant et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>) as it did not provide data on pain intensity, and the study of Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>) because only means and standard deviations of the baseline and change scores were reported and standard deviations for the follow-up scores could not be calculated because correlation data for the baseline and change scores were not provided. However, even when we included the studies by Atkinson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>) in our sensitivity analysis, our conclusions remained unchanged. Salerno et al (<LINK REF="REF-Salerno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerno 2002</LINK>) did not report how they imputed data for the studies of Alcoff et al (<LINK REF="STD-Alcoff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Alcoff 1982</LINK>) and Pheasant et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pheasant-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pheasant 1983</LINK>). We were unable to find recent contact information for Alcoff and Pheasant, nor clarify the methodology used by Salerno and colleagues. Similarly, the review by Staiger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Staiger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staiger 2003</LINK>) excluded the trial of Jenkins et al (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1976</LINK>) from their meta-analysis on the basis that there were insufficient data. However, we were able to calculate standardised mean differences from the post treatment means and standard deviations for both of these and thereby include these in our meta-analysis. Our review reflects the findings of Jadad and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1997</LINK>), which showed that a meta-analysis with a more comprehensive set of trials is less likely to generate positive results (i.e. a statistically significant favourable effect).</P>
<P>The current review is the most up-to-date, high quality meta-analysis on antidepressants and has included all available randomised controlled trials. We found no clear evidence to support the clinicians' prescription of antidepressants in reducing pain and depression for patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain shouldn't be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for the use of tricyclic antidepressants in other forms of chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Saarton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saarton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 2005</LINK>) and fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 2000</LINK>). Given this review was limited by a paucity of trials, small study populations and variation in study quality and patients recruited, further research is required to confirm the effect of antidepressants on low-back pain.</P>

<P>To confirm the effect of antidepressants on low-back pain, more studies with large, homogenous study populations, that meet high methodological standards and involve long-term follow-up are required. Future research should also focus on the (cost-) effectiveness of antidepressants for the management of patients with chronic low-back pain.</P>

<P>Was the method of randomisation adequate? A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer-generated random numbers table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the treatment allocation concealed? Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the patient blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
<P>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable? The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</P>
<P>Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.</P>
<P>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Were co-interventions avoided or similar? Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or be similar between the index and control groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the compliance acceptable in all groups? The review author determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar? Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</P>

<P>Based on information provided in the study report, the review authors should answer these questions with 'yes', 'no', 'unsure'<BR/>
<BR/>1. Are the patients described in detail so that you can decide whether they are comparable to those that you see in your practice?<BR/>
<BR/>2. Are the interventions and treatment settings described well enough so that you can provide the same for your patients?<BR/>
<BR/>3. Were all clinically relevant outcomes measured and reported?<BR/>
<BR/>4. Is the size of the effect clinically important?<BR/>
<BR/>5. Are the likely treatment benefits worth the potential harms?</P>
