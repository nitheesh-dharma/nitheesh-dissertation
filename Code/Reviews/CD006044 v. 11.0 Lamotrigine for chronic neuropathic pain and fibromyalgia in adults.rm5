<DESCRIPTION>
<P>New searches run in November 2013 identified no new studies for inclusion, but did find a small amount of additional data for one study that was already included (<LINK REF="STD-Silver-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 2007</LINK>), and one additional excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2011</LINK>). We have updated the Background section and made minor changes to the Methods, in line with a standard protocol for antiepileptic drugs for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. A new analysis of participants experiencing any adverse event has been added. We have also included a PRISMA flow chart and 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
<P>Title changed from 'Lamotrigine for acute and chronic pain' in order to conform with other reviews in the series on neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, since there is little or no use or intended use of lamotrigine and similar drugs in acute pain, or other forms of chronic pain.</P>

<P>Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is lacking, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain.</P>
<P>Lamotrigine is a medicine used to treat epilepsy, and so might be a useful medicine for neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.</P>
<P>On 26 November 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials where lamotrigine was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found 12 studies of reasonable quality that tested lamotrigine against placebo for a number of weeks. Almost half of the 1511 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes, and seven different painful neuropathic conditions were examined. No studies looked at fibromyalgia.</P>
<P>Lamotrigine did not help the pain, and was no different from placebo except in causing more side effects. Adverse events were more frequent with lamotrigine than placebo, with rash in 1 person in 27.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-25 13:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of the original Cochrane review entitled <I>Lamotrigine for acute and chronic pain</I> published in Issue 2, 2007, and updated in Issue 2, 2011. Some antiepileptic medicines have a place in the treatment of neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This updated review adds no new additional studies looking at evidence for lamotrigine as an effective treatment for chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. The update uses higher standards of evidence than previously.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-11-04 11:55:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> To assess the analgesic efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate adverse effects reported in the studies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-26 14:48:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lamotrigine for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia (including cancer pain) from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We ran searches for the original review in 2006, in 2011 for the first update, and subsequent searches in August 2013 for this update. We sought additional studies from the reference lists of the retrieved papers. The original review and first update included acute pain, but no acute pain studies were identified.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-28 15:55:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs investigating the use of lamotrigine (any dose, by any route, and for any study duration) for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Assessment of pain intensity or pain relief, or both, using validated scales. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only full journal publication articles.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-26 11:41:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. The first tier used data where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain reduction from baseline, lasted at least eight weeks, had a parallel group design, included 200 or more participants in the comparison, and reported an intention-to-treat analysis. First-tier studies did not use last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputational methods for dropouts. The second tier used data that failed to meet this standard and second-tier results were therefore subject to potential bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-26 14:49:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve included studies in 11 publications (1511 participants), all with chronic neuropathic pain: central post-stroke pain (1), chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (1), diabetic neuropathy (4), HIV-related neuropathy (2), mixed neuropathic pain (2), spinal cord injury-related pain (1), and trigeminal neuralgia (1). We did not identify any additional studies. Participants were aged between 26 and 77 years. Study duration was two weeks in one study and at least six weeks in the remainder; eight were of eight-week duration or longer.</P>
<P>No study provided first-tier evidence for an efficacy outcome. There was no convincing evidence that lamotrigine is effective in treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia at doses of 200 mg to 400 mg daily. Almost 10% of participants taking lamotrigine reported a skin rash.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-22 12:11:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large, high-quality, long-duration studies reporting clinically useful levels of pain relief for individual participants provided no convincing evidence that lamotrigine is effective in treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia at doses of about 200 to 400 mg daily. Given the availability of more effective treatments including antiepileptics and antidepressant medicines, lamotrigine does not have a significant place in therapy based on the available evidence. The adverse effect profile of lamotrigine is also of concern.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-25 14:52:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2007</LINK>), which looked at lamotrigine to treat acute and chronic pain of any type. In 2011 we updated the review with the addition of five new studies (1111 participants, of whom 767 received lamotrigine), using stricter methodological criteria to reduce potential bias (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2011a</LINK>). We made the decision to update again, and to concentrate on chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. We changed the title from <I>Lamotrigine for acute and chronic pain</I>, because there have been further recent advances in the rigour with which we assess studies and report data. We also made this decision in order to conform with other reviews in the series on neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and because there is little or no use or intended use of lamotrigine and similar drugs in acute pain, or other forms of chronic pain.</P>
<P>In particular we considered study size and duration, outcomes reported, and method of imputation for withdrawals, and we now report results in two tiers according to outcome and freedom from known sources of bias. We wanted to bring this review in line with a template protocol so that it could easily be included in the overview of antiepileptics for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013a</LINK>). Reviews of carbamazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2011b</LINK>), clonazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Corrigan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrigan 2012</LINK>), gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>), lacosamide (<LINK REF="REF-Hearn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearn 2012</LINK>), phenytoin (<LINK REF="REF-Birse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birse 2012</LINK>), pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>), topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013b</LINK>), and valproic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2011</LINK>) have been completed.</P>
<P>The aim is for all reviews to use the same methods, based on new criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). A Cochrane review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>). This indicated that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so. While fibromyalgia is considered to have a different aetiology from chronic neuropathic pain, it is a condition that responds to the same therapies. Because of limitations in the number of available clinical trials, it is convenient to consider fibromyalgia together with neuropathic pain. We make no presumption to pool data across individual neuropathic pain conditions or fibromyalgia, but will consider each condition separately.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-25 14:52:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain definition of <I>neuropathic pain</I> is "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system" (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2011</LINK>) based on an earlier consensus meeting (<LINK REF="REF-Treede-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treede 2008</LINK>). Neuropathic pain may be caused by nerve damage, but is often followed by changes in the central nervous system (CNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moisset-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moisset 2007</LINK>). Neuropathic pain tends to be chronic and may be present for months or years. It is complex (<LINK REF="REF-Apkarian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apkarian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracey 2011</LINK>), and neuropathic pain features can be found in patients with joint pain (<LINK REF="REF-Soni-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soni 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Fibromyalgia</I> is defined as widespread pain for longer than three months with pain on palpation at 11 or more of 18 specified tender points (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1990</LINK>), and is frequently associated with other symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, and depression. More recently, a definition of fibromyalgia has been proposed based on symptom severity and the presence of widespread pain (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2010</LINK>). The cause, or causes, are not well understood, but it has features in common with neuropathic pain, including changes in the CNS. Moreover, patients with neuropathic pain and those with fibromyalgia experience similar sensory phenomena (<LINK REF="REF-Koroschetz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koroschetz 2011</LINK>). Many people with these conditions are significantly disabled with moderate or severe pain for many years.</P>
<P>In primary care in the United Kingdom (UK), the incidences per 100,000 person-years' observation have been reported as 28 (95% confidence interval (CI) 27 to 30) for postherpetic neuralgia, 27 (26 to 29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (0.6 to 1.1) for phantom limb pain, and 21 (20 to 22) for painful diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). Estimates varied between studies, often because of small numbers of cases. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia has been estimated at 4 in 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1994</LINK>), while more recently, a study of facial pain in The Netherlands found incidences per 100,000 person-years of 12.6 for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9 for postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2009</LINK>). A systematic review of chronic pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, can be more common, with prevalence rates up to 400 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>). The prevalence of neuropathic pain was reported as being 3.3% in Austria (<LINK REF="REF-Gustorff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustorff 2008</LINK>), 6.9% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 2008</LINK>) and as high as 8% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>), and about 7% in a systematic review of studies published since 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>). Some forms of neuropathic pain, such as diabetic neuropathy and post surgical chronic pain (which is often neuropathic in origin) are increasingly common (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). Fibromyalgia is common, especially in women, with an all-age prevalence of 12%, and a female to male ratio of 6:1 (<LINK REF="REF-McNally-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNally 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia are known to be difficult to treat effectively, with only a minority of individuals experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from any one intervention. A multidisciplinary approach is now advocated, with pharmacological interventions being combined with physical or cognitive interventions or both. Conventional analgesics are usually not effective. Some patients with neuropathic pain may derive some benefit from topical lidocaine patch or low concentration topical capsaicin, although evidence of benefit is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khaliq-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaliq 2013</LINK>). High concentration topical capsaicin may benefit some patients with postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>). Treatment is more usually by so-called unconventional analgesics such as antidepressants like duloxetine and amitriptyline (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>) or antiepileptics like gabapentin or pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>). The proportion of patients who achieve worthwhile pain relief (typically defined as at least 50% pain intensity reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>)) is small, typically 10% to 25% more than with placebo, with numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) usually between 4 and 10.</P>

<P>Lamotrigine, a phenyltriazine, is chemically unrelated to other antiepileptic drugs. The drug is available as standard oral tablets (25 mg to 200 mg) and chewable, dispersible tablets (2 mg to 100 mg), and a new extended release tablet is available in some parts of the world.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-25 13:34:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug exerting its antiepileptic effect via sodium channels. There is some evidence that agents that block sodium channels are useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-McCleane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCleane 2000</LINK>). There is evidence from animal models supporting the use of lamotrigine in neuropathic pain, and for an effect in experimental pain models such as cold-induced pain in humans (<LINK REF="REF-McCleane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCleane 2000</LINK>). Lamotrigine is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic agents. There has also been discussion of the role of lamotrigine as a pre-emptive analgesic to reduce postsurgical pain (<LINK REF="STD-Bonicalzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bonicalzi 1997</LINK>). More recently it has been shown that neuronal alpha4 beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may be a target for lamotrigine, and this may mediate its antiepileptic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-25 13:35:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standards used to assess evidence in chronic pain trials have changed substantially in recent years, with particular attention being paid to trial duration, withdrawals, and statistical imputation following withdrawal, all of which can substantially alter estimates of efficacy. The most important change is the move from using average pain scores, or average change in pain scores, to using the number of participants who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%); this level of pain relief has been shown to correlate with improvements in comorbid symptoms, function, and quality of life. These standards are set out in the reference guide for pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-AUREF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUREF 2012</LINK>) and reflect what patients with chronic pain want from treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane review assesses evidence in ways that make both statistical and clinical sense, and uses developing criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>). Trials included and analysed need to meet a minimum of reporting quality (blinding, randomisation), validity (duration, dose and timing, diagnosis, outcomes, etc), and size (ideally at least 500 participants in a comparison in which the NNT is four or more (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Lamotrigine is not widely prescribed for neuropathic pain, though it is prescribed for some cases of painful HIV-related neuropathy. It is important to know its place in the range of drugs used to treat the various types of neuropathic pain. This updated review brings the evidence for lamotrigine into line with that for other medicines used in these conditions, and will form part of an overview of antiepileptic drugs for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.</P>

<P>We anticipated that studies would use a variety of outcome measures, with the majority of studies using standard subjective scales (numerical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale (VAS)) for pain intensity or pain relief, or both. We were particularly interested in Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) definitions for moderate and substantial benefit in chronic pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). These are defined as at least 30% pain relief over baseline (moderate), at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial), much or very much improved on patient global impression of change (PGIC) (moderate), and very much improved on PGIC (substantial). These outcomes are different from those set out in the earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2007</LINK>), concentrating as they do on dichotomous outcomes where pain responses do not follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. People with chronic pain desire high levels of pain relief, ideally more than 50%, and with pain not worse than mild (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the likely impact on the strength of the evidence of various study characteristics relating to methodological quality (randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, freedom from selective reporting), study validity (duration, outcome reporting, and handling of missing data), and size (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risks of bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and adapted from those used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, eg random number table; computer random number generator); unclear risk of bias (method used to generate sequence not clearly stated). We excluded studies using a non-random process (eg odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions before assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (eg telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (method not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation (eg open list).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study states that it was blinded and describes the method used to achieve blinding, eg identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study states that it was blinded but does not provide an adequate description of how this was achieved). We excluded studies that were not double-blind.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data). We assessed the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk of bias (&lt; 10% of participants did not complete the study, or used &#8216;baseline observation carried forward&#8217; analysis, or both); unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) analysis); high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis).</LI>
<LI>Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). We assessed studies as being at low risk of bias (&#8805; 200 participants per treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 participants per treatment arm); high risk of bias (&lt; 50 participants per treatment arm).</LI>

<P>We considered individual painful conditions separately because placebo response rates with the same outcome can vary between conditions, as can the drug-specific effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>We analysed data for each painful condition in three tiers, according to outcome and freedom from known sources of bias.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The first tier uses data meeting current best standards, where studies report the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent), without the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method for dropouts, report an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, last eight or more weeks, have a parallel-group design, and have at least 200 participants (preferably at least 400) in the comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012b</LINK>). These top-tier results are reported first.</LI>
<LI>The second tier uses data from at least 200 participants but where one or more of the above conditions is not met (for example reporting at least 30% pain intensity reduction, using LOCF or a completer analysis, or lasting four to eight weeks).</LI>
<LI>The third tier of evidence relates to data from fewer than 200 participants, or where there are expected to be significant problems because, for example, of very short duration studies of less than four weeks, where there is major heterogeneity between studies, or where there are shortcomings in allocation concealment, attrition, or incomplete outcome data. For this third tier of evidence, no data synthesis is reasonable, and may be misleading, but an indication of beneficial effects might be possible.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio for benefit with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a fixed-effect model, together with numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). This was done for effectiveness, for adverse effects, and for drug-related study withdrawal. We also undertook meta-analysis when appropriate data were available. We calculated NNTs as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1998</LINK>). For unwanted effects, the NNH (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome) is calculated in the same way. In the absence of dichotomous data, we have reported summary continuous data where available and appropriate, but did not carry out any analysis.

None of these demonstrated any major benefits.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2001</LINK>), a 50% reduction in pain measured in the last three weeks of treatment was reported by 12/27 on lamotrigine titrated up to 400 mg daily and 5/26 on placebo. In two large randomised studies of lamotrigine 200 mg to 400 mg daily, with a 12-week maintenance phase, there was no difference between lamotrigine and placebo for the outcome of at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="STD-Vinik-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Vinik 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinik-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Vinik 2007b</LINK>). Combining these studies, 145/567 (26%) of participants experienced at least 50% pain relief with lamotrigine 200 mg to 400 mg daily, and 50/206 (24%) with placebo. There was no overall significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo (RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.4)) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were not consistently reported across studies. Seven studies, with 1121 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finnerup-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Finnerup 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vestergaard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vestergaard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinik-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Vinik 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinik-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Vinik 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zakrzewska-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zakrzewska 1997</LINK>) reported the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. Combining the studies across conditions, 531/740 (72%) of participants had an adverse event with lamotrigine and 237/381 (62%) with placebo. The RR just reached statistical significance at 1.1 (1.01 to 1.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and the NNH was 10 (6.5 to 27).</P>
<P>Rash can be problematic with lamotrigine. It was mentioned as an adverse event or adverse event withdrawal in 11 studies, and omitted from a long list of adverse events in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Zakrzewska-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zakrzewska 1997</LINK>). Combining studies, the overall incidence of rash was 9.5% with lamotrigine and 5.6% with placebo, barely achieving statistical significance (RR 1.4 (1.01 to 2.0)) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). This would indicate that rash with lamotrigine would affect about one person in 27 who would not have been affected with placebo.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 16:37:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiepileptic drugs have been used in the treatment of neuropathic pain since lamotrigine was first used for trigeminal neuralgia in the 1960s. Other antiepileptic drugs have been examined, with good evidence of efficacy for gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>) and pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>), and these two are now widely used. Although various drugs may be useful in controlling seizures, they have different mechanisms of action. There is no reason why a drug effective at seizure control should necessarily be effective in treating neuropathic pain. Lamotrigine, a relatively new antiepileptic drug, has therefore been investigated in neuropathic painful conditions.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-25 14:00:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large, high-quality, long-duration studies reporting clinically useful levels of pain relief for individual participants provide no convincing evidence that lamotrigine is effective in treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia at doses of about 200 mg to 400 mg daily. There is very limited evidence for a possible effect of lamotrigine in central post-stroke pain and in a subgroup of patients with HIV-related neuropathy receiving antiretroviral therapy. No benefit was demonstrated for diabetic neuropathy, in intractable neuropathic pain, spinal cord injury, or trigeminal neuralgia. We found no studies testing lamotrigine in fibromyalgia. The small number of studies and the small number of participants are insufficient to provide robust evidence for effect.</P>
<P>Safety is an important aspect of the choice of treatment even in difficult conditions. In this review, about 10% of participants developed a rash; this fits with wider epidemiological work (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2006</LINK>). The results are consistent with reports in the manufacturer's summary of product characteristics. Serious potentially life-threatening rashes such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome are estimated to occur at an incidence of 1 in 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-SPC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPC 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-08 14:07:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The difficulties of dose titration and adverse effects are likely to dissuade many clinicians from choosing lamotrigine to treat neuropathic pain, and it is possible that those conducting the studies have chosen to include the more difficult participants in terms of severity and duration of pain.</P>
<P>Efficacy and adverse event outcomes were not consistently reported across the studies, and this limited the analyses to some extent.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 16:36:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review covered a number of different painful conditions. For some, like HIV neuropathy for instance, it is unclear whether antiepileptic drugs are effective in the condition, and any indication of benefit is welcome. The main quality issues involve reporting of outcomes of interest, particularly dichotomous outcomes equivalent to Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), as well as better reporting of adverse events. The earliest study was published in 1997, and there have been major changes in clinical trial reporting since then. The studies themselves appear to be largely well-conducted, and individual patient analysis could overcome some of the shortcomings of reporting, though not the paucity of participants studied in each neuropathic pain condition.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-25 14:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review was restricted to randomised double-blind studies, thus limiting the potential for bias. Other possible sources of bias that could have affected the review included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Duration - NNT estimates of efficacy in chronic pain studies tend to increase (get worse) with increasing duration (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>). However, all studies were six weeks or longer, and most longer than eight weeks.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes may affect estimates of efficacy, but the efficacy outcomes chosen were of participants achieving the equivalent of IMMPACT-defined moderate or substantial improvement, and it is likely that lesser benefits, such as 'any benefit' or 'any improvement', are potentially related to inferior outcomes, though this remains to be clarified. Most authors attempted to report dichotomous outcomes of interest, especially in the larger, more recent studies.</LI>
<LI>The question of whether cross-over trials exaggerate treatment effects in comparison with parallel-group designs, as has been seen in some circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>), is unclear but unlikely to be the source of major bias (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Withdrawals meant that any results were more likely to be per protocol for completers than for a true ITT analysis. Parallel group studies were larger than cross-over studies, and predominated analyses in terms of number of participants, with only about 100 participants in cross-over studies.</LI>
<LI>The absence of publication bias (unpublished trials showing no benefit of lamotrigine over placebo) can never be proven. However, publication bias is irrelevant where the published studies show no effect of treatment.</LI>
<LI>Imputation methods used when participants withdrew were typically either last observation carried forward (LOCF) or were not stated; no study reported clearly that participants achieving acceptable levels of pain relief were unequivocally on treatment at the end of the study. Use of LOCF imputation can overestimate efficacy, particularly where adverse event withdrawals are high with active treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012b</LINK>).</LI>

<P>This update does not substantially change the results of the 2011 update, which itself was broadly in agreement with the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of pharmacological treatment of painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2010</LINK>) did not find lamotrigine 600 mg/day to be better than placebo. A non-systematic review considered lamotrigine to be effective, but based on only a fraction of the results presented in this updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2002</LINK>), and <LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2002b</LINK> suggested that lamotrigine is as good as amitriptyline and is a first-line agent in central neuropathic pain.</P>
<P>Guidelines from Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Attal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2010</LINK>) and the International Association for the Study of Pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2010</LINK>) reported that there were few data for lamotrigine in any neuropathic pain condition, and recommended its use only as a third line medication, and probably only in a specialist setting.

<P>Based on current evidence, the routine use of lamotrigine is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of neuropathic pain, and there are more effective and safer medicines available (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>). There may be a role for experimental use or in patients who have failed to obtain pain relief from other treatments.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-22 12:29:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reasonable levels of evidence exist for the benefit of other antiepileptic drugs and antidepressants in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. There is therefore probably no justification for further research given the lack of evidence for benefit from lamotrigine and the potential for harm due to skin rash, which can occasionally be serious.</P>

<P>There have been several recent changes in how efficacy of conventional and unconventional treatments is assessed in chronic painful conditions. The outcomes are now better defined, particularly with new criteria of what constitutes moderate or substantial benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>); older trials may only report participants with "any improvement". Newer trials tend to be larger, avoiding problems from the random play of chance. Newer trials also tend to be longer, up to 12 weeks, and longer trials provide a more rigorous and valid assessment of efficacy in chronic conditions. New standards have evolved for assessing efficacy in neuropathic pain, and we are now applying stricter criteria for inclusion of trials and assessment of outcomes, and are more aware of problems that may affect our overall assessment. To summarise some of the recent insights that must be considered in this new review:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pain results tend to have a U-shaped distribution rather than a bell-shaped distribution. This is true in acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011c</LINK>), back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010b</LINK>), arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>), as well as in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2010</LINK>); in all cases average results usually describe the experience of almost no-one in the trial. Data expressed as averages are potentially misleading, unless they can be proven to be suitable.</LI>
<LI>As a consequence, we have to depend on dichotomous results (the individual either has or does not have the outcome) usually from pain changes or patient global assessments. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group has helped with their definitions of minimal, moderate, and substantial improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). In arthritis, trials shorter than 12 weeks, and especially those shorter than eight weeks, overestimate the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009b</LINK>); the effect is particularly strong for less effective analgesics, and this may also be relevant in neuropathic-type pain.</LI>
<LI>The proportion of patients with at least moderate benefit can be small, even with an effective medicine, falling from 60% with an effective medicine in arthritis, to 30% in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>). This indicates that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so.</LI>
<LI>Finally, presently unpublished individual patient analyses indicate that patients who get good pain relief (moderate or better) have major benefits in many other outcomes, affecting quality of life in a significant way (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>).</LI>
