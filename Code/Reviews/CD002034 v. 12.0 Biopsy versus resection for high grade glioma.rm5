<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-15 11:03:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malignant gliomas are aggressive tumours of the nervous system. Resection (surgery to remove the tumour) may relieve symptoms but there is uncertainty that it extends survival. Biopsy can confirm diagnosis and carries fewer risks, but will not extend survival or improve symptoms. It is controversial as to which procedure is the best management option. One small trial looking at this problem was found but the trial proved inadequate and of low quality to answer the question conclusively. Larger well designed trails are required in the future.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:15:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Patients with a presumed high grade glioma (HGG) identified by clinical evaluation and radiological investigation have two initial surgical options; biopsy or resection. In certain situations, such as severe raised intra-cranial pressure, surgical resection is clinically indicated. Where surgical resection is not feasible, biopsy is the only reasonable option. Most patients fall somewhere between these extremes and in such circumstances it is uncertain which procedure offers the best surgical option for the patient. Opinion is divided regarding the relative risks and benefits of each procedure.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:20:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To estimate the clinical effectiveness of surgical resection compared to biopsy in patients with a new presumptive diagnosis of HGG.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:16:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The following databases were searched for the update: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3 2010 ), MEDLINE and EMBASE. The original search also included Cochrane Cancer Network (CCN), CancerLit, Biosis and Science Citation Index. Reference lists of all identified studies were searched. The Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology were hand searched from 1999 to 2010 (including all conference abstracts). Neuro-oncologists were contacted regarding ongoing and unpublished trials. The searches were updated in 2003, 2007 and 29th October 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:16:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Patients included those of all ages with a presumed diagnosis of HGG based upon clinical and radiological investigation. Interventions included any form of biopsy or resection. Surgery was at the time of initial presentation and not for recurrence. Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-27 20:45:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two reviews authors independently assessed the search results for relevance and undertook critical appraisal according to pre-specified guidelines. Outcome measures include survival, time to progression/progression free survival, quality of life (QoL), symptom control, adverse events and mortality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:17:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A single RCT of biopsy versus resection in presumed HGG was identified and is discussed in this review. No other articles met the inclusion criteria. Personal communication revealed an RCT of biopsy versus resection in the elderly with HGG due to commence in France in 2007 but by this 2010 update no further information is available regarding this trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-15 11:41:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no high quality evidence on biopsy versus resection for HGG that can be used to guide management. The single included RCT is of inadequate methodology to reach reliable conclusions. Further large multi-centred RCTs are required to conclusively answer the question of whether biopsy or resection is the best initial surgical management for HGG.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-27 20:47:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-27 20:46:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Gliomas are tumours of the brain and spinal cord, so called because they develop from the glial cells that surround neurons. Gliomas are graded histologically according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification on a scale of I to IV (<LINK REF="REF-Kleihues-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleihues 1993</LINK>). High grade gliomas (HGG) belong to grades III or IV and have in common an aggressive and infiltrating nature. The majority of HGG are of the subtype Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) or Anaplastic Oligodendrocytoma (AO).</P>
<P>High grade gliomas are the most common primary nervous system tumours, with an annual incidence of almost 10 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Counsell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Counsell 1998</LINK>). The peak age of onset is between 50 and 60 years, and generally the clinical presentation is of short duration. Symptoms most commonly include a mixture of headache, focal neurology, and non-specific changes such as altered mental state or gait dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The natural history is a progressive decline in neurological function, with a median survival of around a year based on selected patients enrolled in clinical trials, although there is not a recent prospective cohort study. Young age, lower histological grade of tumour and good neurological function at diagnosis are the most reliable clinical prognostic factors. Algorithms can identify patient sub-groups with median survival ranging from around a month to greater than three years (<LINK REF="REF-Curran-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamborn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamborn 2004</LINK>). Curative therapy is rarely possible necessitating that current therapies should emphasise symptomatic improvement and QoL. Glucocorticosteroids constitute a fundamental, predominantly symptomatic, component of management. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the core therapeutic modalities with both having a substantial evidence basis (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-01-15 11:03:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery of various forms has a traditional role in the management of HGG. Biopsy seeks to achieve a histological diagnosis with minimal risk which can be used to guide further therapy; resection aims to remove the majority of tumour with subsequent symptomatic relief and increased survival. It is hypothesised that resection provides a distinct clinical advantage over sole histological confirmation, provided by biopsy, and that the risks associated with resection do not offset any possible benefits.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-27 20:47:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is an extensive and conflicting literature on the relative merits of each procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Proescholdt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proescholdt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). Studies are often retrospective case series whilst direct comparisons are compounded by differences in patient characteristics, surgical technique and outcome reporting. It is not clear whether the more invasive procedure of resection confers any practical benefits other than histology. The size of any benefit for resection must be quantified along with the risks involved in order to help make informed management decisions.</P>

<P>Studies must be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the selection criteria (described in detail below). External signs of each surgical technique are different and often clinically obvious meaning that blinding is often not feasible and was not be an inclusion criteria. Only studies where the original decision to randomise patients to resection or biopsy were included; studies which randomised patients to receive another treatment regime (e.g. radiotherapy, chemotherapy or 5-ALA) and subsequently stratified patients (in a non-random fashion) according to degree of surgery were not accepted. Foreign language journals were eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>Patients with a presumed HGG from clinical examination and imaging (CT and/or MRI) were be included. Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Patients were be stratified for age, performance status and histology (the main prognostic factors) in order to provide comparable treatment arms. Performance status was recorded using the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Karnofsky-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnofsky 1948</LINK>) or World Health Organisation (WHO) score (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1982</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-10 15:46:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<UL>
<LI>Biopsy: This included all procedures where the sole primary aim is to sample the tumour for diagnostic purposes. Eligible variations include: free hand or stereotactic guided; frame-based or frame-less stereotaxy; CT, MRI or other imaging (e.g. positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance spectroscopy) as the guiding modality for the neuronavigation system; Stealth®, Brainlab® or other commercial manufacturers equipment; and awake or general anaesthesia. Treatment crossover was allowed although ideally minimised in trial design.</LI>
<LI>Resection: This included all procedures where the pre-operative aim is to remove more tumour than is necessary for diagnosis. Resection is often graded as either attempted total, partial, or palliative de-bulking; all of which are eligible for inclusion. Assessment of complete resection can be by the surgeons operating opinion but ideally by early post-operative imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Hensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensen 2008</LINK>). All aids to achieving surgical resection - including neuro-navigation, 5-ALA/Gliolan® guided resection, Sonowand® and intra-operative MRI - were eligible for inclusion. A histologically complete resection was believed to be unlikely given that HGG can be found to have infiltrated beyond the contrast-enhancing lesion seen on CT scan (<LINK REF="REF-Devaux-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaux 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreth-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nazzaro-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nazzaro 1990</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Post-operative management: In light of the known effectiveness of certain treatments a management algorithm, ideally conforming to known standards, was desirable (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rampling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampling 2005</LINK>). Ideally including medical management of seizures and other symptoms; glucocorticosteroids for brain oedema, symptoms of raised intra-cranial pressure or focal deficits; and radiotherapy according to accepted guidelines. Chemotherapy (PCV, temozolomide or other) in either arm is left to the discretion of the individual attending physician.</LI>

<P>The databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for the updates in 2007 and again in October 2010. The original search strategy also included, Cochrane Cancer Network (CCN), CancerLit, Biosis and Science Citation Index. The same principle was used to search each database. Firstly, the terms and phrases identifying randomised or clinical controlled trials were combined using the Boolean "OR". Secondly, all the terms and phrases describing malignant glioma, were combined with "OR". Thirdly, everything used to identify the interventions of interest i.e. biopsy versus resection, was combined with "OR". These terms were then grouped with the Boolean operator "AND" and the results displayed. Wild cards and truncation symbols were used to ensure terms with alternative spellings and/or endings were not missed. MeSH terms were exploded.

Six other reports of RCTs have assessed neurosurgical aids to gross total resection in HGG but they did not directly compare biopsy versus resection: three were on fluorescence-guided surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Eljamel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eljamel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stummer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stummer 2006</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Stummer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stummer 2008</LINK>), two on neuro-navigation (<LINK REF="STD-Willems-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willems 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2007</LINK>) and one on awake cortical mapping (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2007</LINK>).

<P>Full analyses of the internal and external validity of this study are provided in additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Power: The authors did not provide a sample size calculation based on the primary endpoint of survival. If we assume a optimistic median survival of 100 days in the biopsy arm (in the trial the actual survival was 85 days) and estimate the number of patients in each arm required to show a conservative increase in survival of 30 days in the resection arm (145 days in the trial) with a power of 80%, an accrual period of two years and follow up period of two years, a trial of approximately 500 patients (250 in each arm) would be required.</LI>
<LI>Allocation: the method of randomisation and its concealment was not described. No stratification for age, tumour grade or performance status was performed at randomisation. It is unclear of all potentially eligible patients were approached for participation and whether the results reflect a continuous series of participants or a selected series.</LI>
<LI>Baseline participant characteristics: there were inequalities between the two study arms at baselines and no statistical tests were used to describe the</LI>
<UL>
<LI>85% of patients in the biopsy arm were 70 years or over compared with 50% in the resection arm</LI>
<LI>23% of patients in the biopsy arm had a KPS greater than or equal to 80 compared with 60% in the resection arm</LI>
<LI>77% of patients in the biopsy arm received radiation therapy compared with 90% in the resection arm</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Blinding: the study did not blind investigators or participants to the study arm allocation. Although initial blinding to study arm is impossible for the attending surgeon and unlikely to be reliable for the patient, investigators at follow-up could potentially be blinded as the larger cosmetic defect produced by a craniotomy (required for resection) is not always immediately obvious particularly to physicians.</LI>
<LI>Outcome detection: the lack of blinding and single objective outcome measure applied (survival) opens up the potential for bias in reporting of results. Time to Deterioration as defined here will depend on the social support systems available to each patient in determining the detection accuracy.</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting: no intention to treat (ITT) analysis was performed. The seven patients in total that were randomised but later excluded were not analysed as part of the trial results. Data on only 13 of 16 patients in the biopsy arm (81%) and 10 out of 14 patients in the resection arm (71%) were provided.</LI>
<LI>Post-operative management: the lack of blinding is of significant concern here and the actual treatments are not clearly specified. Time to deterioration was not different between study arms which could be consistent with more aggressive management of the resection group at recurrence (e.g. further surgery or chemotherapy). The lower percentage of patients receiving post-op radiotherapy after biopsy as opposed to resection was accounted for by poor patient status but the lack of blinding could have introduced treatment bias into the equation.</LI>
<LI>Statistics: all statistical tests appeared appropriate but no confidence intervals were given for time to deterioration.</LI>

<P>In light of only a single trial suitable for inclusion no meta analysis was performed and instead a description of outcome measures reported in the trial is reported.</P>
<P>Survival was recorded from the time of surgery for the valid study group (i.e. not ITT analysis): this was demonstrated in a Kaplan Meier plot and compared by non-parametric log rank chi-square test. Median survival times (MST) were: biopsy 85 days (95% CI 55 to 157) versus resection 171 days (95% CI 146 to 278) (P = 0.0346). The hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for tumour grade was 2.621 (95% CI 1.035 to 6.641) (P = 0.0422). The HR adjusted for radiotherapy dose was 2.729 (95% CI 1.035 to 7.195) (P = 0.0423).</P>

<P>Time to Deterioration (as defined by "not able to live at home; time after which patient stayed permanently in a nursing home") was 72 days in the biopsy group and 105 days in the resection group (no 95% CI were give) P = 0.056. No QoL data was recorded. No patient in the biopsy group had a procedure-related complication however one of the ten patients in the resection group had a post-operative haematoma that required re-operation.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:18:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is an extensive literature on surgery for HGG and a comprehensive reviews of this have recently been published (<LINK REF="STD-Proescholdt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proescholdt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2004</LINK>). The majority of studies are non-randomised, highly selected and retrospective. The limitation of non-randomised studies is the inherent risk of bias in allocating patients to a treatment in day-to-day practice; 'fitter' patients receive resection whilst 'inoperable' tumours are subject to biopsy. Pre-operative prognostic factors including age, performance status and histology are known to be the most significant determinants of outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Curran-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamborn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamborn 2004</LINK>). This obstacle essentially nullifies any robust conclusions that can be made from studies of the above design. To enable objective scientific comparison an equal and consecutive series of patients must be randomly allocated to either treatment.</P>
<P>Our literature search only identified one RCT that met our entry criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Vuorinen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vuorinen 2003</LINK>). Due to under-powering and methodological limitations the findings are tainted by a high likelihood of being affected by bias and chance. Although the authors reported their findings as being in favour of surgery, a technically more correct description would be that the findings from this trial are of insufficient reliability to be used to influence treatment decisions. It should be viewed as evidence that RCTs are feasible in the area and used as a building block for further RCTs.</P>
<P>Compelling results for extent of resection having a positive correlation with survival are presented in a post-hoc analysis of 243 patients involved in a trial of 5-ALA (<LINK REF="STD-Stummer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stummer 2008</LINK>). In this study patients were randomised to resection of a newly diagnosed HGG by either white light or fluorescence guided resection (with oral 5-ALA). Re-stratification into groups that received complete versus incomplete resection revealed a survival benefit in favour of complete resection (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.71). Despite these favourable results this report still does not represent a RCT with the primary goal of comparing biopsy with resection and is therefore ineligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis.</P>
<P>When a patient presents with clinical features suggestive of a HGG, imaging is accurate with regards to the diagnosis of a tumour, but it is not accurate for the identification of the grade of tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Kondzioloka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondzioloka 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2002</LINK>). A pathological diagnosis is desirable to allow identification of other treatable conditions such as cerebral abscess, and to allow identification of tumours with specific treatments such as germinomas. In the included RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Vuorinen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vuorinen 2003</LINK>), the initial imaging diagnosis was found to be inaccurate in 21% (6 out of 29 cases), with 50% of inaccurate diagnoses being for non-malignant conditions. Brain tumours are often heterogenous, and it is possible that small tissue samples through a biopsy may not be diagnostic or representative of the tumour as a whole. One prospective series of patients who underwent biopsy then resection, a mean of 3 weeks later, found that biopsy correctly guided therapy in 91% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Woodworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodworth 2005</LINK>). Biopsy of a small area of anaplasia in a predominant low grade glioma may lead to inappropriately early therapy. Conversely, biopsy sampling of a small area of more benign looking tissue in a HGG may lead to a delay in treatment. Within clinical trials, this may lead to some patients with low grade glioma being included in the biopsy arm that would have a reasonable prospect of long term survival.</P>
<P>With the lack of primary outcome data, careful attention needs to be paid to the risks of each patient to assess the cost benefit ratio. Biopsy is considered a low risk procedure, with a morbidity rate from retrospective series of around 3.5% and a mortality rate of less than1% (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1998</LINK>). Practically, biopsy can be performed under local anaesthesia and as a day-case procedure. The results of prospective studies of complications following neurosurgery in brain tumours are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. In two prospective series resection had a morbidity rate of 32% and a mortality of 1.7 to 3.3% (<LINK REF="STD-Fadul-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fadul 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawaya-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sawaya 1998</LINK>). In eloquent areas of the brain surgery still carries a low risk of morbidity and can improve dysphasia when intra-operative brain mapping and awake craniotomy is utilised (<LINK REF="STD-Whittle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Whittle 1998</LINK>). Regarding relief of symptoms from resection, there is some evidence that 32% will improve, while in 58 to 76% this was not discernibly different (<LINK REF="STD-Fadul-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Fadul 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawaya-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sawaya 1998</LINK>). However, while surgery can improve some symptoms, it can also create new post-operative deficits.</P>
<P>Only broad guidelines can be made from our findings and treatments must be considered on an individual basis. Biopsy may be the only option for certain deep seated tumours (e.g. infiltrating the thalamus, corpus callosum or brainstem), while small superficially placed frontal tumours can often be resected with a low risk of new deficits. Due to the associated risks of resection, biopsy is currently preferred for patients with poor performance status, of older age, or when the lesion is in an anatomically prohibitive location for resection (e.g. in deep or eloquent regions). In other selected groups of patients the risks of resection may be lower, and there may be a greater likelihood for benefits from surgery. In some patients the prognosis may be deemed so poor that treatment would only be palliative, and histology would not affect this management direction.</P>
<P>Histological diagnosis is desirable for the management of a suspected brain tumour, and can be achieved through either biopsy or resection. There is no good evidence from RCTs that resection offers any clear advantage over biopsy. Stereotactic biopsy has a low risk of complications and is an effective tool for histology, although there is a risk of sampling error. Biopsy however is not risk free and has no direct therapeutic action. For each patient the relative benefits and risks of each procedure need to be considered. Future trials in this area need to be larger and randomised, with greater attention to symptom profile and QoL in their outcome analysis.</P>

<P>No evidence based recommendations as to the best surgical management of patients with HGG can be made.</P>
<P>Until there is better evidence, it is important to consider each case individually and for the surgeon to carry out the procedure which is deemed to be the most appropriate for that particular patient, taking into account the risks and benefits. Such decisions are best made at a multi-disciplinary team meeting (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the lack of RCT-based evidence, individual clinicians should be encouraged to enter their patients into a controlled clinical trial, if such a trial were to be established in the future.</P>

<P>RCT considering fluorescent guided surgery compared to normal resection.</P>
<P>322 patients aged between 23 to 73 were enrolled. Fluorescence guided surgery resulted in an increase in complete resections (65% versus 36%) and a higher 6 month progression free survival (41% versus 20%). No effect was noted on survival. Adverse effects were reported as unchanged.</P>
<P>Some questions remain about the methods used in the trial. In brief, there was a high exclusion rate, and some concern over why some in the treatment arm dropped out before radiotherapy. Definitions of the two main outcome measures of complete resection and recurrence are also not robust or stringent enough for clinical use. External validity is low with the patients very highly selected and not reflecting those in routine clinical practice. Finally, there is some concern that the more aggressive resections in the treatment arms resulted in greater post-operative morbidity, but not enough detail is given in the article to fully analyse this area.</P>

<P>An RCT of neuro-navigation aided resection compared with normal resection.</P>
<P>In total 45 patients were recruited, and the results are part of a preliminary analysis of a larger study. There was no difference in the primary outcomes of survival or extent of resection. It was felt by the surgeon that neuro-navigation was useful, and it didn't lead to considerably longer operating times or greater adverse events. There is a suggestion that there were fewer acute deficits in the first few days post-operatively in the neuro-navigation arm, and that the treatment arm had a lower use of steroids.</P>
<P>The main flaws with this study are that it's patients were highly selected, and possibly that the non-treatment arm had a slightly better prognosis at baseline. This fact and the coincidental early deaths of 3 patients in the treatment arm, together with the low power to detect effects, put the trial at a significant risk of a type 1 error.</P>

<P>A similar search strategy to the one for Biosis was used. Searches were made in the Title, Keyword or Abstract.<BR/>Unlike Biosis, there was no "major concepts" search facility.<BR/>
<BR/>The differences were as follows:<BR/>1. "tumo*" was used in place of "tumo*r"<BR/>2. "central &amp; nervous &amp; system &amp; tumo*" and "central &amp; nervous &amp; system &amp; neoplasm" were two additional searches.<BR/>3. "extent &amp; resection" was used in place of "extent of resection"</P>
