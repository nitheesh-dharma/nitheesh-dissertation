Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses.</P><P>Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death.</P><P>Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched.</P><P>We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments.</P><P><B>Search date</B></P><P>Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown.</P><P><B>Study funding sources</B></P><P>Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non-government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate-quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non-individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short- or long-term cure, or in prevention of ARTI.</P><P>Two low-quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low-quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-04-08 18:32:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-04-08 14:14:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common and may lead to complications. Most children experience between three and six ARTIs each year. Although these infections are self limiting, the symptoms can be distressing. Many treatments are used to control symptoms and shorten the duration of illness. They often have minimal benefit and may lead to adverse effects. Oral homeopathic medicinal products could play a role in the treatment of ARTIs for children if evidence for effectiveness is established.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:15:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral homeopathic medicinal products compared with placebo or conventional therapy to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-04-08 18:32:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 11), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 27 November 2017), Embase (2010 to 27 November 2017), CINAHL (1981 to 27 November 2017), AMED (1985 to December 2014), CAMbase (searched 29 March 2018), British Homeopathic Library (searched 26 June 2013 - no longer operating).

Four treatment studies examined the effect on recovery from URTIs, and four studies investigated the effect on preventing URTIs after one to three months of treatment and followed up for the remainder of the year. Two treatment and two prevention studies involved homeopaths individualising treatment for children. The other studies used predetermined, non-individualised treatments. All studies involved highly diluted homeopathic medicinal products.</P><P>We found several key limitations to the included studies, in particular methodological inconsistencies and high attrition rates, failure to conduct intention-to-treat analysis, selective reporting, and apparent protocol deviations. We assessed three studies as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, and many had additional domains with unclear risk of bias. Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non-government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support.</P><P>Methodological inconsistencies and significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity precluded robust quantitative meta-analysis. Only four outcomes were common to more than one study and could be combined for analysis. Odds ratios (OR) were generally small with wide confidence intervals (CI), and the contributing studies found conflicting effects, so there was little certainty that the efficacy of the intervention could be ascertained. All studies assessed as at low risk of bias showed no benefit from oral homeopathic medicinal products; trials at uncertain and high risk of bias reported beneficial effects.</P><P>We found low-quality evidence that non-individualised homeopathic medicinal products confer little preventive effect on ARTIs (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.57). We found low-quality evidence from two individualised prevention studies that homeopathy has little impact on the need for antibiotic usage (N = 369) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.76). We also assessed adverse events, hospitalisation rates and length of stay, days off school (or work for parents), and quality of life, but were not able to pool data from any of these secondary outcomes.</P><P>There is insufficient evidence from two pooled individualised treatment studies (N = 155) to determine the effect of homeopathy on short-term cure (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 19.54; very low-quality evidence) and long-term cure rates (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.96; very low-quality evidence). Adverse events were reported inconsistently; however, serious events were not reported. One study found an increase in the occurrence of non-severe adverse events in the treatment group.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-29 05:08:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Pooling of two prevention and two treatment studies did not show any benefit of homeopathic medicinal products compared to placebo on recurrence of ARTI or cure rates in children.

On average, children have between three and six ARTIs annually, and they are the most common cause of both illness and mortality in children aged under five years outside the neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Simoes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simoes 2006</LINK>). A systematic analysis estimated that in 2010 almost 12 million episodes of severe and 3 million episodes of very severe acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) resulted in hospital admission worldwide in young children (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2013</LINK>). Acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for 25% of all deaths in children aged under five years (excluding neonates); 90% of these deaths are due to pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-GBD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD 2015</LINK>).</P><P>Acute respiratory tract infections can be classified as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The upper respiratory tract consists of the airways from the nostrils to the vocal cords in the larynx, including the paranasal sinuses and middle ear. The lower respiratory tract comprises the airways from the trachea and bronchi to the alveoli. Upper respiratory tract infections may include nasopharyngitis, laryngitis, pharyngo-tonsillitis, and otitis media. Lower respiratory tract infections comprise bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. For the purposes of this review, we used 'ARTI' to represent both URTIs and LRTIs.</P><P>Current conventional interventions to control ARTIs are based on basic health care and environmental health, such as the widespread use of vaccinations, simple case-by-case management to diagnose and treat children promptly using conventional pharmaceutical therapies, and improvements in nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>). Conventional medical therapy for URTIs includes analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines, expectorants, various types of antibiotics, and nutritional supplements (<LINK REF="REF-eTG-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">eTG 2016</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-29 05:36:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are becoming increasingly popular (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2015</LINK>). Homeopathy, one of the many forms of CAM, is based on treatments using the principles of 'similars' and 'dilutions' (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Treweek-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Treweek 2006</LINK>). Homeopathic medicinal products are produced by serial dilutions with vigorous shaking between dilutions (potentisation) of a substance (such as an herb or trace element). This process is thought to imprint information from the diluted substance to the solvent (<LINK REF="REF-Schulte-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulte 1999</LINK>). Homeopathic practitioners claim benefit, especially for children, and in particular when dealing with respiratory infections that account for the most common cause of morbidity in children. In addition, the overuse of antibiotics and their lack of benefit against viral respiratory illnesses calls for new approaches to treat common respiratory infections (<LINK REF="REF-Fahey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Homeopathic care is the holistic primary care role provided by a homeopath involving interventions that may range from reassurance to behavioural strategies to provision of a homeopathic medicinal product (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00fc_dtke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lüdtke 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutten-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shang 2005</LINK>). One of the basic tenets of homeopathic treatment is individualisation, whereby two or more patients with the same medical diagnosis might receive different medicines, based on the specific symptoms of illness in each patient, the patient&#8217;s mood, type of pain, and amount of thirst, and the time of aggravation of symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>). When a homeopathic medicinal product is prescribed by a homeopath, individual substances for treatment are selected based on a thorough assessment, including a comprehensive history of presenting symptoms. However, commercially available over-the-counter homeopathic medicinal products sold without an individualised assessment or prescription are increasingly popular.</P><P>When assessing the evidence, it is important to consider the effect of holistic homeopathic care including an individualised medicinal product prescribed by a homeopath (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00fc_dtke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lüdtke 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutten-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shang 2005</LINK>), versus homeopathic medicinal product alone (e.g. non-individualised remedies available for a specific indication, or an over-the counter, one-size-fits-all basis). In this review we therefore distinguish between and separately analyse studies of individualised homeopathy (participants were assessed and prescribed an individualised remedy) and non-individualised homeopathy (all treatment arm participants were given the same pre-formulated, often commercially available homeopathic medicinal product). The role of self or parent-selected homeopathic medicinal products based on simplified constitutional indications, for example personality descriptions, has been studied (<LINK REF="STD-Steinsbekk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Steinsbekk 2007</LINK>). We considered such therapeutic options as falling within individualised homeopathy.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-29 05:43:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The interventions considered in this review included homeopathic medicinal products with single or multiple components initiated by homeopaths after a consultation (individualised homeopathy), or the use of homeopathic medicinal products not individually prescribed, usually obtained over the counter (non-individualised homeopathy).</P><P>The basic concept behind homeopathic remedies is 'similia similibus curentur' (like cures like) (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walach 2005</LINK>). Practically, this means that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person is the same substance that can cure symptoms in an ill patient.</P><P>Whether or not homeopathy can be effective is a subject of debate, as actual doses of homeopathic drugs are far below what is considered to have any medically quantifiable effect. The compounds involved in the medicinal products are highly diluted in either alcohol or water. The original substance is diluted 1:99 parts of water or alcohol, followed by a second dilution of 1:99 parts and so on. The process may occur more than 30 times before the final mixture is produced. Furthermore, the mixture must be shaken a set number of times in a particular manner between every dilution because this is believed to lead to memory in the molecules and release the healing energy of the compounds, that is succussion (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2007</LINK>). The compounds involved may be diluted based on a number of established potency scales such as originally described by Hahnemann as the centesimal or 'C scale' and more recent scales such as the D, Q, or LM scales (<LINK REF="REF-Jonas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 2003</LINK>). However, there are no established explanatory models for how highly diluted homeopathic medicinal products might work. For this reason, homeopathy remains highly controversial because the key concepts governing this form of medicine are not consistent with the established laws of conventional therapeutics (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2012</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-29 05:50:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Homeopathy is a popular method of treatment for respiratory-type illnesses, but its effectiveness and potential side effects are not well researched.</P><P>Most analyses of the research on homeopathy have concluded there is little or no evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any specific condition, based on flawed or inadequate studies conducted. However, some individual observational studies, randomised, placebo-controlled trials, and laboratory research have reported positive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ullman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ullman 2010</LINK>). Most also failed to differentiate between the efficacy of nanopharmacological and behavioural components of homeopathic care. Two recent systematic reviews examined separately individualised and non-individualised placebo-controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Mathie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathie-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathie 2017</LINK>). Both reviews found a small potential benefit for homeopathy, but cautioned that low or unclear overall quality of the evidence prompts caution in interpreting the findings. Variation and uncertainty in the efficacy of homeopathic remedies outlines the need for future research on homeopathy to be conducted with rigorous attention to design elements that would reduce risk of bias. We focused only on studies that were double-blind, as this potentially removes some of the possible biases that may account for positive results seen in some single-blind and observational studies.</P><P>There are a limited number of homeopathy studies and analyses available in comparison to conventional therapy and, hence, there is no structured, unbiased outline of homeopathic medicinal products that would serve as a guideline for practitioners interested in CAM. A systematic review of double-blind randomised controlled trials on the effects of homeopathic products and care in respiratory infections in children would inform consumers and practitioners on the highest level of evidence base for homeopathy and contribute to the development of comprehensive guidelines for the management of respiratory tract infections in children.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-03-26 10:28:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral homeopathic medicinal products compared with placebo or conventional therapy to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-04-08 18:36:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-04-04 10:55:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-03-29 05:53:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or double-blind cluster-RCTs comparing homeopathy with placebo or conventional treatments to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children.

The small number of participants who returned symptom diaries also resulted in inadequate power for the relevant outcomes. This is particularly noteworthy given that the only outcomes showing statistical significance in favour of the homeopathy group were symptom diary-based outcomes (analysis of twice-daily data on severity of cold symptoms), while other outcomes with lower risk of attrition bias (e.g. phone follow-up) found no significant results.</P></EXCLUSIONS><SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2018-03-30 05:06:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Published prospective protocols were not available for most studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2016</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-NCT01257503" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT01257503</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Steinsbekk-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Steinsbekk 2005a</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Steinsbekk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinsbekk 2004</LINK>).</P><P>All primary outcomes in the methods were reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Lange-de-Klerk-1994" TYPE="STUDY">de Lange de Klerk 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedrero_x002d_Escalas-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Pedrero-Escalas 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinsbekk-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Steinsbekk 2005a</LINK>), which we assessed as at low risk of reporting bias.</P><P>We assessed <LINK REF="STD-Malapane-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Malapane 2014</LINK> as at unclear risk of selective reporting.

The use of mean score on rating scales for the whole group, with small sample sizes, obscured the difference between groups from percentages with less and more severe disease at baseline.

Secondly, outcomes were listed in the methods that were not reported on in the results (duration in days of flu and acute respiratory infection symptoms, and adverse events).

Rating scales for some examination items appeared to be subjective, for example red/inflamed pharynx was measured in ordinal categories: absent (code 0), slightly red (code 2), red (code 4), very red (code 6), severely red (code 8), and extremely red (code 10). Also, 10 of the 15 children in the placebo group were reported to still have pain on swallowing at about one week since onset of diagnosis, despite mention in the discussion section that viral tonsillitis typically lasts for seven days. The predominance of results reported as mean rating score for each group led to a statistically significant difference at trial end for most outcomes that was probably not clinically significant. For example, pain on swallowing at day 6 between groups was 0.67 for treatment and 1.87 for placebo group (P = 0.037). The paper states that this difference had a large effect size (r = 0.6), yet a score of 2 on the 10-point rating scale was "slightly red throat", and a score of zero was absent redness.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Malapane-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Malapane 2014</LINK> drew several conclusions that were difficult to justify in the setting of a small sample size, and appeared potentially biased in its discussion, with overemphasis on positive outcomes, while negative findings were downplayed (e.g. analysis between groups showed that the homeopathic complex outperformed placebo, with a large effect size). The homeopathy treatment was stated to be well tolerated with no adverse events; however, with a very small sample size in a population from a single source and demographic group, this statement should be qualified. The authors stated that symptoms in the treatment group improved between days 5 and 6, yet the daily rating scale means showed a linear, progressive downward trend rather than an obvious day of recovery. The interpretation of this benefit was compared to the known average duration of viral URTIs from the literature, rather than data from this trial, with a conclusion that the homeopathic treatment may reduce the duration of acute viral tonsillitis by up to two days. Furthermore, there were no measures in place to ensure adherence to correct administration of the study medication, which could be considered an oversight given that children as young as six years were self administering a sublingual preparation.</P><P>We assessed <LINK REF="STD-Siqueira-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Siqueira 2016</LINK> as at unclear risk of other bias due to an unexplained decrease in ARTI/flu episodes for all participants. This suggests that perhaps not all ARTIs that occurred were captured by the study data. The mean number of flu/ARTI episodes in the year before the study (apparently based on consulting medical records) was 1.51 episodes per child (calculated by review author KH based on Table 1 data). Of note, this refers only to the 445 children who completed the study and that greater than or equal to four episodes were calculated as four episodes. This is a very low annual ARTI incidence for young children, and is unlikely to capture additional episodes for which the child did not present for medical care. It is therefore particularly surprising that the mean number of ARTI episodes during the 12-month study period was even lower for both placebo and homeopathy groups. The mean number of ARTI episodes was 1.07 in the placebo group and 0.40 in the intervention group (also calculated by KH based on Table 2, which refers only to the 445 children who completed the study and that "greater than or equal to four" episodes were calculated as four episodes). The study authors did not address this low overall incidence of ARTI in the discussion or suggest reasons for a decrease in incidence among all study groups. This issue is considered a risk factor because it raised concern about the overall rigour of data collection.</P><P>There appears to have been a protocol deviation in <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK>. The day 3 commencement of antibiotics (for those with less than 50% improvement) in the conventional group, but not the homeopathy group, led to a biased reporting of the outcome requirement for rescue antibiotics.

Short-term cure data showed little difference between homeopathy and control groups for resolution of symptoms of AOM (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK>).

For pooled long-term cure data, there was an odds ratio of 1.01 (95% CI 0.10 to 9.96), favouring the homeopathy group. Again, the wide confidence interval reflects that two studies found opposite directions of effect at these time points: in <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK> homeopathy participants had a higher cure rate, while in <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK> conventional treatment participants had a higher cure rate.

Studies that reported adverse events found no adverse events in either participant group (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malapane-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Malapane 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siqueira-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Siqueira 2016</LINK>), which is questionable considering the numbers of children involved. We did not identify any studies that specifically investigated the effect of homeopathic remedies on lower respiratory infections.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-30 14:46:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There were several key limitations related to the quality of the current evidence, in particular methodological inconsistency among studies, small sample sizes in some studies, high attrition rates in some studies, failure to conduct intention-to-treat analyses, selective reporting, and apparent protocol deviations.</P><P>Methodological inconsistency meant robust quantitative meta-analyses could not be conducted. There was significant clinical face value heterogeneity among studies. Data that were amenable to quantitative meta-analysis showed high statistical heterogeneity. Odds ratios were generally small with wide confidence intervals, often in association with contributing studies reporting opposite directions of effect. This meant that little certainty regarding the efficacy of the intervention could be ascertained.</P><P>Several included studies were small and inadequately powered to determine statistically significant differences between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK> was well conducted with a low risk of bias, however it was a pilot study aimed at determining the appropriate sample size and outcome measures for a future adequately powered study. We could find no such future study after conducting an exhaustive search, and contact with the study author confirmed this lack of a larger follow-on trial. Consequently, as the study authors state, it was &#8220;impossible to draw conclusions from this preliminary study&#8221; (p. 181), and indeed most outcome measures found a non-significant difference between homeopathy and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK> was also described as a pilot study.</P><P>There was high attrition bias with failure to conduct intention-to-treat analyses in several included studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2016</LINK>, a generally well-conducted study, only 162 of 261 participants returned symptom diaries. While the baseline demographics between &#8220;Did not return symptom diary&#8221; and &#8220;Returned symptom diary&#8221; groups showed no significant differences, there is a reasonable likelihood that failure to return the symptom diary may have been associated with some differences in illness progression or participant or family characteristics. The few participants who returned symptom diaries contributed to inadequate power for analysis of relevant outcomes. Phone follow-up was subject to less risk of attrition bias: 244 of 261 participants completed phone follow-up. Notably, none of the phone-based follow-up outcomes showed any significant results, while some of the symptom diary-based outcomes were reported to favour the homeopathy group.</P><P>Selective reporting was a concern in several studies, in particular <LINK REF="STD-Siqueira-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Siqueira 2016</LINK>. The results of this study focus on an arbitrary cut-off of three or more flu and ARTI episodes for comparison between groups, a benchmark not set prospectively in the methods and which favoured the homeopathy group. The study did not provide mean numbers for ARTIs for each group and does not acknowledge that the placebo group actually had a greater proportion of children with no ARTI episode during the follow-up period. The primary outcome stated in the methods section was the number and duration in days of ARTIs, the latter not reported anywhere in the paper. Yet other findings not specified in the methods (and favourable to the homeopathy group) were described (without data), such as the number of infections in the first few months following the month of active treatment. Finally, the very low total number of ARTIs during the 12-month follow-up period (compared to the year before and to known incidence data for childhood ARTI) suggests the monthly assessments to check for URTI may not have picked up all true cases.</P><P>Apparent protocol deviations were a concern in <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK> was at unclear or high risk of bias across six domains (allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment - participant-reported outcomes, blinding of outcome assessment - practitioner outcome assessors, selective reporting, other bias). Apparent protocol deviations were the greatest concern in <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK>, with methods and results differing on the matter of antibiotic provision at day 3 for children with less than 50% improvement. The methods indicated that all children with less than 50% improvement on day 3 would be commenced on antibiotics. However, in practice only the conventional treatment group participants were commenced on antibiotics, with results stating "In the Conventional treatment group, antibiotics prescribed were azithromycin (17 patients), and amoxicillin (22 patients). Initially all patients were treated with antipyretics, anti-inflammatory for first three days, but only one patient was cured. From the third day, antibiotics were prescribed in 39 patients and they all got cured at end of treatment" (p. 10). Despite a clear difference in how groups were treated (i.e. conventional group commenced on antibiotics on day 3, homeopathy group not commenced on antibiotics on day 3 despite some children having less than 50% improvement), requirement for antibiotics was still reported as an outcome measure. The mean symptom scores for the homeopathy group on day 3 were 57% of the entry symptom scores, making it impossible that the homeopathy participants all had greater than 50% symptom resolution by day 3 and therefore did not require protocol-driven prescription of antibiotics. This different treatment of groups raises additional concerns for allocation concealment and blinding, as the clinicians prescribing the antibiotic must have been aware of the allocations.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2012</LINK> was the only study not to disclose funding sources or rule out financial conflicts of interest. Three of the studies were partly funded by manufacturers of the homeopathic products being tested (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pedrero_x002d_Escalas-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Pedrero-Escalas 2016</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-31 06:32:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To overcome potential biases in the review process, a minimum of two review authors independently assessed included trials for quality and risk of bias; a third review author independently verified a random selection of extracted data.

This assessment was based on:</P><UL><LI>overview of published systematic reviews by an independent contractor published in English between 1 January 1997 and 3 January 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Optum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Optum 2013</LINK>);</LI><LI>independent evaluation of information provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public; and</LI><LI>consideration of clinical practice guidelines and government reports on homeopathy published in other countries.</LI></UL><P>The overview considered 57 systematic reviews and 176 individual studies that assessed the effectiveness of homeopathy (individualised homeopathy or clinical homeopathy) compared to placebo or other treatment, for treating 61 health conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Optum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Optum 2013</LINK>). The reviewers identified three systematic reviews where the effectiveness of homeopathy was assessed for the treatment of people with an ARTI (<LINK REF="REF-Altunc-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altunc 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellavite-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellavite 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linde-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1998</LINK>). Of the three RCTs (unreported or medium to good quality; total of 486 participants, range: 60 to 251) that compared homeopathy with placebo, the one medium-sized, good-quality trial (251 participants) in children with URTI did not detect a difference between homeopathy and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Steinsbekk-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Steinsbekk 2005b</LINK>). Based on the body of evidence, the reviewers determined that homeopathy is not more effective than placebo for the treatment of people with URTI.</P><P>When homeopathy was compared with other therapies (including anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics) in ARTI, the only systematic review (assessed as of poor quality) identified six studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bellavite-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellavite 2011</LINK>). Of these, only two studies (level II evidence) were exclusively in children: one medium-sized RCT (quality not reported; 208 children with URTI) (<LINK REF="STD-Steinsbekk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Steinsbekk 2007</LINK>); and one study (quality not reported; 170 children with pharyngitis or tonsillitis) (<LINK REF="STD-de-Lange-de-Klerk-1994" TYPE="STUDY">de Lange de Klerk 1994</LINK>).

Funders and study investigators contemplating any further research in this area need to consider whether further research will advance our knowledge, given the uncertain mechanism of action and debate about how the lack of a measurable dose can make them effective. The studies we identified did not use a uniform approach to choosing and measuring outcomes or assigning appropriate time points for outcome measurement. The use of validated symptom scales would facilitate future meta-analyses. It is unclear if there is any benefit from individualised (classical) homeopathy over the use of commercially available products.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-31 06:45:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We would like to acknowledge the contributions of Annika Mascarenhas and Jacqueline Seebold, who wrote the protocol under the guidance and supervision of Mieke van Driel and Treasure McGuire.

We made this change to enable the inclusion of studies that used a non-individualised (i.e. preformulated or over-the-counter) homeopathic remedy. This is becoming an increasingly common method of accessing homeopathic remedies by healthcare consumers, which also warrants assessment of the available evidence. We separated studies of individualised and non-individualised treatments for the review because individualised homeopathy involves an assessment by a practitioner and selection of treatment based on the patient/symptoms/personality, etc., while conversely, non-individualised (one-size-fits-all) homeopathic remedies are becoming popular but are only chosen based on the indication (e.g. 'cold and flu') and could be considered a different type of intervention.</P><P>We added disease severity as indicated by mean symptom score to the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY" TYPE="SECTION">Primary outcomes</LINK>. Given the self limiting nature of most respiratory tract infections, a difference in disease severity is clinically significant. Many currently available respiratory tract infection remedies are aimed at reduction in symptoms rather than cure, so it was warranted to also evaluate the homeopathic treatments for this outcome.</P><P>We added antibiotic use as a 'rescue therapy' or surrogate for treatment failure to the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY" TYPE="SECTION">Secondary outcomes</LINK>. Both additional outcomes were informed by outcome measures used in other systematic reviews of acute respiratory tract infections.
