<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) is a complication of cancer chemotherapy that exposes patients to life-threatening infections. Current practice for neutropenic patients with fever is hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Febrile neutropenia encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and low risk patients may be treated less aggressively. This review of randomised controlled trials showed comparable death and failure rates for oral and intravenous antibiotics for low risk patients, those with solid tumours or chronic leukaemia or lymphoma, and independent of age, source of infection and severity of the neutropenia.</P>

<P>Fever occurring in a neutropenic patient remains a common life-threatening complication of cancer chemotherapy. The common practice is to admit the patient to hospital and treat him or her empirically with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-30 12:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 4) and LILACS (1982 to 2007). We searched several databases for ongoing trials. We checked the conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) (1995 to 2007), and all references of included studies and major reviews were scanned.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:49:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotic(s) to intravenous antibiotic(s) for the treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever. The comparison between the two could be started initially (initial oral) or following an initial course of intravenous antibiotic treatment (sequential).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. Data concerning mortality, treatment failures and adverse events were extracted from the included studies assuming an 'intention-to-treat' basis for the outcome measures whenever possible. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for dichotomous data. Risk of bias assessment was also made in line with methodology of The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two trials (3142 episodes in 2372 patients) were included in the analyses. The mortality rate was similar when comparing oral to intravenous antibiotic treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.68, 9 trials, 1392 patients, median mortality 0, range 0% to 8.8%). Treatment failure rates were also similar (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, all trials). No significant heterogeneity was shown for all comparisons but adverse events. The effect was stable in a wide range of patients. Quinolones alone or combined with another antibiotic were used with comparable results. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, were more common with oral antibiotics.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the present data, oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenic cancer patients (excluding patients with acute leukaemia) who are haemodynamically stable, without organ failure, and do not have pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe soft-tissue infection. The wide CI for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for mortality, and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Patients with cancer who experience fever while being neutropenic are at risk of serious infections (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klaassen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaassen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pizzo-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pizzo 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rackoff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rackoff 1996</LINK>). Empirical use of antibiotics, based on previous practice without knowledge of the cause of infection, has lowered the incidence of death and serious complications (<LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viscoli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscoli 2002</LINK>). Traditionally the practice is to admit and treat neutropenic patients empirically with intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics at the emergence of a fever (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The empirical selection of an appropriate antibiotic is based on the patient's immune status (that is being neutropenic) as well as the suspected invading organism and its susceptibility to antibiotics. Neutropenic cancer patients form a heterogeneous group. A retrospective study indicated the existence of a patient subpopulation responding promptly to antibiotic therapy, thus raising the possibility of using different treatment strategies, such as oral therapy and outpatient treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1988</LINK>). In parallel, the pattern of pathogens (that is bacteria) in neutropenic patients with fever has changed, with a declining incidence of Gram-negative bacteraemia and increasing incidence of Gram-positive infections (<LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>), resulting in a change in antibiotic practice. Oral treatment became a viable option with the advent of new extended spectrum oral antibiotics. The potential of oral treatment and the deleterious effects of hospitalisation (with need for an intravenous access line, exposure to multi-drug resistant organisms) and greater awareness of the importance of quality of life and patient satisfaction, especially among cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1994</LINK>), has led to a re-evaluation of the approach to neutropenic febrile patients.</P>
<P>Research has therefore focused on methods to prospectively identify neutropenic patients with fever who are at low risk of complications. Several clinical prediction rules were developed and validated for children and adult populations at low risk (<LINK REF="REF-Klaassen-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaassen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rackoff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rackoff 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1992</LINK>). Talcott et al constructed four groups out of which one included patients with an expected low complications rate. The patients at low risk developed fever out of hospital, had controlled cancer and had no co-morbidity. The rule was validated prospectively and later tested in a pilot study for its ability to select patients for early switch from IV to oral treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1992</LINK>). A consensus panel, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), developed a set of criteria that are predictors of good prognosis in 'low risk' adult patients: acquisition of fever out of hospital, age younger then 60 years, absent to moderate symptoms, no hypotension, no chronic bronchitis, and a background of either a solid tumour or haematological malignancy with no history of fungal infection; in a validated scoring system. While receiving conventional therapy patients with a score of equal to or greater than 21 had a low rate of serious medical complication (6%) and only 1% mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Simultaneously, clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Malik-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Malik 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubenstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rubenstein 1993</LINK>) have examined the safety and feasibility of oral antibiotic treatment in selected patients. In the absence of an accepted definition there was no consistency in the selection of patients defined as a 'low risk' group. Most of these trials were small, single centre trials. Thus, although reporting similar rates of success for oral and intravenous therapy, the superiority of an intravenous regimen cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>The most recent guidelines for antibiotic treatment in neutropenic patients with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>) are very cautious regarding the use of oral antibiotics alone. They recommend careful selection of low risk patients and limit this approach to adults, of whom only some may receive the treatment at home.</P>
<P>In the present systematic review we intended to provide better evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of oral treatment as opposed to intravenous treatment. We tried to clarify the definitions of the low risk subgroup and the appropriate antibiotics for oral treatment as well as the limits of present knowledge.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-27 10:00:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors working independently assessed the trials fulfilling the review inclusion criteria for methodological quality. This was done using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), which are based on the evidence of a strong association between poor allocation concealment and overestimation of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), as defined below.<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment).<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (uncertainty regarding allocation concealment).<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).<BR/>In addition to the adequacy of allocation concealment, methods of allocation generation, blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, exclusions after randomisation, randomisation unit and publication status were recorded independently by the two review authors. Measures of quality were used for sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>Heterogeneity (degree of difference between the results of different trials) in the results of the trials was initially graphically inspected and assessed by a test of heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic). We had anticipated between-trial variation in estimation of morbidity and mortality for studies comparing broad-spectrum oral treatment versus narrow-spectrum treatment and for studies comparing patients at different risk levels. Heterogeneity was explored through stratifying the above defined patient subgroups (in the 'Objectives'), separating patients with low risk criteria (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>A funnel plot estimating the treatment effect against the precision of the trials (plots of the log of the relative risk for efficacy against the standard error) was examined in order to estimate potential asymmetry that may indicate selection bias (the selective publication of trials with positive findings) or methodological flaw in the small studies.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rates of treatment failure and mortality were not statistically significantly different in neutropenic patients given oral and intravenous antibiotic treatments. The RR for treatment failure in patients treated with oral antibiotics was 0.95. The RR for a fatal outcome was 0.95. No significant heterogeneity was shown for both comparisons. ITT analysis might favour equivalence, however the results of the per protocol analysis were similar to those of the primary analysis.</P>
<P>These effects were stable in a range of patient subgroups. The RR was similar across different case definitions of the underlying disease and the cause of fever. The RR did not depend on the age of the patients or on the antibiotic regimen. It was similar in studies that started patients on immediate oral treatment and in those that switched to oral treatment after a short time of intravenous treatment. Introduction of bias by inadequate randomisation or allocation concealment was shown to be unlikely by the sensitivity analysis. There was a trend toward more adverse effects in patients given oral treatment. However the majority were gastrointestinal complaints that did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy.</P>
<P>One limitation of the analysis is its inability to define the patients who may be offered oral antibiotics. This is due to the variations in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the included trials. The difference in low risk criteria is not surprising, the concept of low risk neutropenic fever and its definition developed during the years in which the studies were performed. Different prognostic criteria evolved based on observational studies. An international collaboration had led to the development of a validated weighted scoring system identifying low risk patients, adopted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (<LINK REF="STD-Chamilos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chamilos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 2006</LINK>). Only one of the trials added in the current version (<LINK REF="STD-Sebban-2009_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Sebban 2009*</LINK>) incorporated that scoring system as an inclusion criterion.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria that were common to all studies were criteria defining severe sepsis (mainly haemodynamic instability and organ failure: altered mental status, respiratory failure, renal and liver abnormalities), inability to swallow or take oral medication, allergy to study drugs, pregnancy and lactation. Most studies did not include patients with acute leukaemia and about half excluded patients with pneumonia, severe cellulitis or intravascular infection.</P>
<P>The low mortality rate led to wide CIs in the absolute risk reduction. To confirm equivalence of two treatments, we should ideally be able to show that any estimate of risk that is included within the CI lies within a predefined range of equivalence (as the CI of the effect of the recommended treatment) and has no clinical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>). In a population with an expected mortality of less than 1% this uncertainty may have no real consequences.</P>
<P>For treatment failure the CI is narrower and probably has no clinical importance since failure means mainly a change in the antibiotic regimen.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral antibiotic therapy can be safely offered to febrile children and adults with neutropenia who are haemodynamically stable, have no organ failure, can take oral medications, do not have pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe soft-tissue infection, and do not suffer from acute leukaemia. These criteria stand in close proximity to those of the IDSA guidelines for the treatment of neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>). Selection of candidates for oral therapy can also be based on the MASCC scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The analysis offered no data in support of a specific oral regimen, but in light of the preponderance of Gram-positive infections (<LINK REF="REF-EORTC-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">EORTC 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamana-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kamana 2005</LINK>) the combination of a quinolone and a second drug active against Gram-positive bacteria (for example ampicilin-clavulanate) seems prudent.</P>
<P>This review did not refer to the issue of home therapy. It could be assumed that home therapy can be offered to a similar population as that approved for oral treatment. In some of the included studies oral therapy was given on an ambulatory basis. The view is that patients can be treated in hospital or under close supervision on an ambulatory basis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-27 09:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A future trial of oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment should include febrile neutropenic patients with mild and stable sepsis, regardless of their underlying disorder, source of infection or neutrophil count. Its sample size should be based on considerations of equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>). The definitions of response and failure and the reported outcomes should be based on the guidelines on methodology for clinical trials involving patients with fever and neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Feld-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feld 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feld-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feld 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For low risk patients (as defined by MASCC or the above criteria) different oral regimens should be compared. Using mortality as the primary outcome in such a trial might translate into a prohibitive sample size. However, the sample size of a trial needed to further reduce the CI shown in the present analysis might be smaller and manageable.</P>
<P>In addition, a randomised controlled trial comparing different oral antibiotic regimens in low risk patients with fever and neutropenia, and in particular fourth generation quinolones with activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes versus a previous generation quinolone plus ampicilin-clavulanate, is warranted.</P>
