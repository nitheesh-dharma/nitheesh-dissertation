I am happy for Anne to add the CI for NNT. Please label as(95% CI NNTH = x to NNTB = y) and possibly explain the uncertainty in the text. Can I double check what the evidence is for increased risk of Pneumonia in ADULTS on PPI (mentioned in the conclusions)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne C (20th Aug 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Emma for for your help in improving the review. Much appreciated. Have accepted all your suggestions and new changes I made are tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results - cough: &lt;/b&gt;In the results section, it was referring to the adult studies (ie it was under the adults section whereas Orientein's paper was in children. I have clarified this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results - sensitivity analysis: &lt;/b&gt;Have now done the insert bit (same values anyway) rather than typing in the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion: H&lt;/b&gt;ave clarified the issues and amended sections. Wrt NNT query, that was along discussion b/e Toby, Chris and I. Chid Toby didn't want it but I wanted to add it in- needless to say Chris and Toby won that battle! If the policy of CAG has changed, I will be happy to provide NNT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma 5th August 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found few issues that I found to do with readability and there are a few points that could be addressed to help the reader. I have made a fe suggestions which i hope you find helpful and not too time-consuming. I have made some minor tracked changes - including a bit about regression to the mean - so please check them before accepting/rejecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you check the review back in I can send it for copy editing and submission on the library. Thanks a lot for all your hard work and well done on updating the review!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results - cough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you tighten up the sentence &amp;quot;None of the studies reported any significant adverse events to interventions and hence 'number needed to harm' was not relevant in this review&amp;quot;. We had a look at the Orenstein paper and there were more details of the SAEs in table IV and we think that it would be good if these were briefly described in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results - sensitivity analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be helpful to state what the primary outcome is and put a link to the analysis in to make it easier for the reader each time that you refer to an analysis result. The best way of including analysis results is by going to [ format &amp;gt; insert analysis results ] and selecting the analysis result required. This means that readers see the results in the same way each time and they are guaranteed accurate (provided you update them if/when the analyses change!). I think that this might be done anyway as part of the copy editing...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I activated the headings as I think it will help you break up the lengthy prose - do you think it will help the reader if you adjust the positions of some of your arguments under these headings? potential biases in the review process - please check this part and you may want to add something about contacting authors for unpublished data or additional references as this is a way of eliminating bias in systematic review process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Chirs and I had a discussion about this. I was not sure what you meant by subjective cough although Chris thought you meant cough measured by subjective methods. Could you make this a bit clearer somehow please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I do not understand the meaning of the sentence &amp;quot; Under such circumstances, &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Altman 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Altman 1998&lt;/a&gt; clearly states that when CI for NNT should not be presented&amp;quot;. Can you have a look at this sentence please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implications for practise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- what do you mean by secondary analysis? subgroup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Final&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the amendments Anne. I have checked the sub group calculations and they are spot on. Good to catch the direction of effect at this stage! Well done. I am happy for this to proceed to submission. As the main results and conclusions are not altered by the new study I would suggest that we do not label this a substantive amendment (in spite of all the work). Are you happy with this.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit Aug 2007&lt;br&gt;Please could you add a brief summary of the update in the What's New section.&lt;br&gt;Abstract: Since one extra study is added why has the number of adults studies gone up from 6 to 8?&lt;br&gt;Methodological Quality: nothing added about quality of new study.&lt;br&gt;REsults:the new study changes the between group results for the PPIs. &amp;quot;Within each subgroup, there was no significant heterogeneity, but the addition of the new data from Steward 2004 has changed the between group test for difference between omeprazole and the other PPIs, which is now significant (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.60). &amp;quot; Anne could you confirm that the direction of effect has been entered correctly for all these cough scores and that a negative number always means less cough?&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&amp;quot; Since other differences between these studies may have contributed to the difference in these results, these post-hoc findings should be treated with caution unless confirmed by head to head trials between omeprazole and other PPIs.&amp;quot; I have added this caution in red.&lt;br&gt;Please could you check if this sub-group difference is mentioned anywhere else?&lt;br&gt;Thanks for completing this update.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit June 2006&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Thanks to Liz for a great job tidying up the references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: &amp;quot;Significant heterogeneity was found between studies using omeprazole and other PPIs.&amp;quot; I have removed this as it is not true, P value is 0.07 for the Chi residual of 3.18 df 1 comparing the two subgroups. Moreover this difference is confounded by study design etc (see result of GIV pooling of two crossovers for example).&lt;br&gt;I have put in the result of the primary outcome in the abstract however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: I have added the result of the between group test for omeprazole versus other PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Anne to make sure she is happy with the above changes before submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================&lt;br&gt;Peer Review feedback 3 FEb 2005&lt;br&gt;1. Few minor textual clarifications made in RED. Peer review feedback in &amp;quot; &amp;quot; and my comment in square brackets.&lt;br&gt;2. Possible missed reference below -&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Backround. Nevertheless, several reviews/guidelines suggest a therapeutic trial of 2-6 months of GORD treatment for non-specific chronic dry cough in both adults and children [Corrao 1996, Irwin 2002a, Kiljander 2003]. Add reference: Kiljander TO. The role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related asthma and chronic cough. Am J Med 2003; 115(3A):65S-71S (this review very much draw the same conclusions than the current manuscript)&amp;quot; [worth adding?]&lt;br&gt;3. Patient characteristics: &amp;quot;Nowadays chronic cough is most often defined as cough lasting more than 8 weeks. In this study also patients who had coughed between 3-8 weeks were included. This may have resulted in that there may have been patients with post infectious cough in the study population, and this may have been a factor why no positive result was found. In my opinion this needs to be discussed.&amp;quot; [what do you think]&lt;br&gt;4. Results &amp;quot;OK. Except that in the paragraphs were the secondary analyses were reported (paragraphs: b,c,d,e) it is said: &amp;quot;Pooled analysis of 3 studies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pooled analysis for all four studies&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Two studies&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Two studies could be utilised&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; References here would make it easier for a reader &amp;quot;[seems good idea]&lt;br&gt;5. Implications for practice: &amp;quot;In the discussion section the authors have already discussed that the use of PPI's may be associated with increased risk of pneumonia. The following should be left out from this paragraph: &amp;quot;&amp;#8230;but has to be balanced with the reported increased risk of pneumonia in adults on acid suppressant therapy.&amp;quot; because in my opinion this matter should not be emphasized.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;[I have some sympathy with this view as the pneumonia idea does not spring directly from the trials in the review?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please respond to the above comments and alter as appropriate! Thanks again.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC 6 Jan&lt;br&gt;Thanks for changing this. Ready for Peer Review now,&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;=======================================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC comments 23 Dec&lt;br&gt;Thanks for taking out the NNTs on the non-signficant outcomes. There is still a problem with the sub-group comparison between omeprazole and the other PPIs. A formal test of heterogeneity between the subgroups is NOT significant, please see Altman DG, Bland JM. Statistics Notes: Interaction revisited: the difference between two estimates. BMJ 2003;326(7382):219-. Toby has a spreadsheet to test between subgroups if you want it! It shows the difference between subgroups is SMD 0.88 (95% CI 1.85 to -0.09) P value 0.07&lt;br&gt;When one sub-group achieves signficance and the other does not it is incorrect to report this as showing that the treatments have different effects. I actually do not think you can report any significant difference between omeprazole and other PPIs so I have taken this out of the synopsis and abstract (see changes in red).&lt;br&gt;There is only one pooled outcome that achieves significance here (which is 2~4) using GIV for the cross-over studies. I think this is the only significant result. The first sentence of the discussion is overstated and does not match the abstract or results. You could report that the direction of the effect in most studies is beneficial but the numbers are tiny, and more data are needed. I have put *** asterisks**** around the sections that need a relook in view of the above comments. I would advise restricting the results section to the pooled results reported, and leave the subgroup issues to the discussion. The implications for practice go way beyond the data presented and I completely missed this last time.&lt;br&gt;Sorry to ask for more work on this and please get back to me if you need clarification of the between subgroup testing.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes for Christmas,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=====================================================================&lt;br&gt;Given that it's C Airway's grp policy, I have rewritten the parts that Chris was not happy with. Attached is the revised version (red bits) and in the interest of transparency (which I totally agree with) I have also indicated so. I can feel some arrows from the believers of frequent cough and GORD coming my way soon (I am not one of those)! Hope it's OK now. Am cc-ing this to Luke and the other co-authors as well, whom I don't think will have a problem with the readjustment in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again Toby.&lt;br&gt;Kind regards&lt;br&gt;Anne&lt;br&gt;===================================================================&lt;br&gt;2 Dec 2004&lt;br&gt;Dear Anne and Toby,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the extra work that has gone into this! I will need to look at the original papers to see if I can make sense of the Kiljander results. Looks complex if the PPI benefit was not shown until the second period (abstract says). I am very happy to accept the reference supporting the &amp;quot;most common symptom&amp;quot; in the background.&lt;br&gt;I am afraid that we are going to have a difference of opinion over the vexed issue of how to report non-significant trends. I will check Toby's GIV data but the other outcomes do NOT achieve statistical significance and as a result the treatment should not be reported as beneficial ~(as this is unproven) and as a consequence NNT should not be calculated. The latter is the policy used in Evidence Based Medicine Journal. This means that the synopsis and results reporting will have to be changed. Whilst I sympathise with the desire to demonstrate the size of the effect with NNT, it is group policy not consider statistical significance first and not to report non-significant pooled results (even though this may be due to the small size of the studies). The bottom line is that the null has not been disproved so we have to say not enough data to be sure.....&lt;br&gt;Also there is no significant difference between PPI subgroups in 2#3 so omeprazole should not be singled out in the synopsis. I have left in red the sections that I am unhappy with. If you want me to reword this I will but you may wish to amend first?&lt;br&gt;I think that the amount of data on a rather small number of patients should not be overstretched by too much sensitivity and subgroup analysis (interesting as it may be) and the main thrust of this review should remain as not enough data availabe to be confident about the effects of Rx. To me this is not how it reads at present.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br&gt;Anne has revised the GORD review (following revision of data as giv I am now co-author). However, the issue of of the NNT remains - I am very uneasy with the NNT for a non-significant OR, BUT.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;AC: 171104&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby&lt;br&gt;Attached is the revised review, which Luke has commented on. The red bits are the new changes from the previous submission. Have added the formula used for NNT. Hope it's OK...we clinicians need simple things to understand and hence I have left the NNT in inspite of the arguments for and against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Hi Anne,&lt;br&gt;We could always just turn the Discussion section in to a narrative of what I did on my holidays last year. That way we avoid all the difficulties and everyone can go home!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally I am happy for any of the NNTs to go forward but the most crucial thing to bear in mind is that we explain what formula we used, where we got it from, and which ratio we used to calculate it (i.e. RD, OR or RR) - that way whichever NNT we give will be valid. I have certainly learnt from this exercise that not only is transparency key in working out these data, but that we need to be warey about balancing the need for an easy interpretation of the data (i.e. a NNT) against the need to be rigorous and open in our methods. This is not necessarily because people will want to criticise us for using one approach over the other, but to enable users to repeat the exercise for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that this clears things up a bit! If you want to use the NNT calculator from the website you found, please references this in the text - just add this to the file you sent me and re-send. If it was just a formula - please entyer this in the text - I'll create an additional table. Having said all this I have realised that Chris will probably want us to take it out!!!! Is it worth pursuing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment for prolonged non-specific cough in children and adults&lt;br&gt;Old title: Gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment for prolonged non-specific cough in children and adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL emailed 29th October:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Anne,&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for the email and the offer of authorship, which I would be honoured to accept. I have gone through the Excel files as far as possible for the following estimates: Comparison 02; outcome 02, Comparison 02; outcome 03, Comparison 02; outcome 06, Comparison 02; outcome 07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some changes to the results based on the data I analysed that you sent to me. I have detailed these in the text in red, and it might be wise for you to read through this section in results. In the end I opted to pool the crossover data with a standardised scale in GIV. I obtained a mean difference and a standard deviation (SD) between PPI and Placebo from the raw data, divided the mean by the pooled SD to give the mean expressed as SD units, then I calculated a standard error (SEM) for the original mean difference (do you want to book a wake-up call at this point?), and divided that by the pooled SD, which I checked against the original mean difference and SEM. Finally I entered a mean and SEM as GIV data in RevMan based on my calculations above. These values represent a difference expressed purely as SD units. I'm out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have attached the review with GIV outcome data in - also I re-calculated the Ns means SDs for the cough scores that you sent to me and I have revised the appropriate section of the review. Thus far I have not described the above technique in the review as I would be there all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope thayt this explanatory note clarifies what I have done with the review. The SD unit GIV outcome for change in symptoms does reflect a significant difference, and I have asserted this in the results of the review. Please do not hesitate to contact me so I know that I have not sent you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Thanks Toby. Can I add you in as author of review- I strongly feel it's only justified. Attached are the relevant files. I'll be in Boston next week from 3rd Nov- just to let you know so if I'm silent that will be the reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am very appreciative of yr help and teaching.&lt;br&gt;Anne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL 271004&lt;br&gt;Anne - I have gone through the data to double-check things. There are a couple of issues regarding reporting of methods as I think that it is important for you to flag up where you have taken estimates from 1st arm of crossover group trials, estimates from crossover trials (i.e. paired data) and where data are from parallel group trials. This is crucial in establishing the validity of data extraction and analysis in the meta-analyses. From the Excel sheets you sent to me, it is becoming clear now that you have probably taken the 1st arm of the crossovers and treated them as parallels - is that correct? If not I have left the data that you entered. If the data are taken from specific columns in the Excel spreadsheet can you tell me which ones contribute to which outcomes, and re-name the outcomes 'parallal &amp;amp; 1st arm data' if they contain such, whether they contain crossover and parallel estimates pooled together? Clearly you have done a very thorough job in getting the trialists to 'cough up' and I think that deriving estimates for these studies would be a very useful exercise indeed. If there are 1st arm crossovers in you will need to reference the correct number of subjects for that treatment period rather than cite the number of participants in the study overall (this will affect the weighting in the SMD analyses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have replicated the SMD for mean change in cough by taking the raw data you kindly gave me for the crossover trials, dividing the mean differences for all participants (i.e. taking parallel and crossover data), and doing likewise for the standard error in order to give an estimate for the study in SD units. I have labelled the GIV outcomes as such in the review.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 21 Oct 2004 SEE CHANGES IN RED PLEASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Kopec title is missing. Please insert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Well presented and thorough. Could you correct the radio buttons to reflect allocation concealment in the final column of the table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[In the version I have/sent, it was marked ie most were marked as unclear. Toby, am I missing something- please help. TJL amended 261004]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Please check the graph labels for continuous outcomes as cough score and change in cough score are both labelled as if they are adverse outcomes (with favours treatment to the left).; is this correct or a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Yes- left favours treatment- should it be the reverse? I just accepted the default! Am unclear-Please advice if this should be swapped. TJL to attend]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Could you add a one line summary to the synopsis please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Please add date of last search. NNT needs to come out as the OR is not significant!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Am I allowed to argue or disagree or does the editor have final say. Irrespectively I need to learn. Reading Altman's paper (Altman DG. Confidence intervals for the number needed to treat. BMJ. 1998; 317:1309-12), he doesn't say this but clearly says when OR is not significant, NNT 95%CI will include a negative number and when this is so, 95%CI should not be presented. Thus extrapolating this, I assume that NNT is still relevant when non-significant as it could be a sample size effect. Also the Cochrane handbook does not advice on this. Can you please help me with this? Of course I am happy to take it out if that is Cochrane policy but I would prefer to leave it in to show that NNT is high if calculated.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: I am not clear how you handled the cross-over data. It should be entered using the GIV method with paired t-test data from the trials (not as shown currently in RevMan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[I couldn't find it in the Cochrane handbook before and rechecked again and still can't find the advice on GIV method for cross over studies. The handbook says &amp;quot;For cross-over trials and trials with outcome assessments at various periods of follow-up, decisions will need to be made about which outcomes to assess&amp;quot; (pg 64). The section is still under construction- Can you please teach me how to do it?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would separate out PPI trials from Cisapride as in my view they are clinically totally different sorts of treatment?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Am not sure what Chris is referring to; we did a priori said we should analyse PPI separately from PPI. There was only one H2 antag study and not included in the meta-analysis. Can you please help clarify Toby?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The report of methodological quality would be more helpful if the studies could be idenified by adding a link to them after you report numbers in each category. See sentence in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Outcome: The OR is not significant so I would not report NNT at all in these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Please point 3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in cough scores all include cross-over data so cannot be used until I am clearer about the methodology used please. Likewise sensitivity analysis reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Please point 4. Will change once above done.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outcome 2#5 shows huge heterogeneity between Kijander and Noordzji - this needs to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Will be done once above known.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion: First Para see above re use of NNT. I would not report it for a non-significant OR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[See point 3.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: The primary outcome is non-significant but is treated as if a significant benefit has been shown (NNT 9). This needs a relook please. Also the data from 3 cross-over trials are a problem (Eherer,Ing,Kijander).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Can only be dealt with once above done.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AC:&lt;br&gt;[Lastly Chris changed &amp;quot;cough is the most common symptom presenting to &amp;#8230;.&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;cough is a very common&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;. The statement I used is referenced and indeed the same is true in the UK and USA as well ie cough as the most common symptom&amp;#8230;(A. H. Morice. Epidemiology of cough.

<TITLE>Gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment for prolonged non-specific cough in children and adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-18 16:10:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cough in association with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is common in adults with chronic cough. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of GORD treatment in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease, i.e. non-specific chronic cough.</P>
<P>Nineteen studies fulfilled our predetermined criteria but only six could be combined (in meta-analysis). We obtained additional data from trialists. We were not able to combine results in children due to limited data. Thickened feeds had an inconsistent effect. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) did not reduce cough and should not be used for cough in young children.</P>
<P>In adults with cough and GORD, no significant difference was found in clinical cure using proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for cough and GORD. Using other outcomes, there was also no significant difference between PPI and placebo. This review also highlights a large placebo and time period effect (natural resolution with time) of treatment for chronic cough. In adults treatment with PPI for cough associated with GORD is inconsistent and its benefit variable. There was insufficient data to draw any conclusion from other therapies for cough associated with GORD.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is said to be the causative factor in up to 41% of adults with chronic cough.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-09-07 10:42:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included 19 studies (six paediatric, 13 adults). None of the paediatric studies could be combined for meta-analysis. A single RCT in infants found that PPI (compared to placebo) was not efficacious for cough outcomes (favouring placebo OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.55) but those on PPI had significantly increased adverse events (OR 5.56; 95% CI 1.18 to 26.25) (number needed to treat for harm in four weeks was 11 (95% CI 3 to 232)). In adults, analysis of H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD was not possible (lack of data) and there were no controlled studies of fundoplication. We analysed nine adult studies comparing PPI (two to three months) to placebo for various outcomes in the meta-analysis. Using intention-to-treat, pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.15). Pooled data revealed no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). We only found significant differences in sensitivity analyses. We found a significant improvement in change of cough scores at end of intervention (two to three months) in those receiving PPI (standardised mean difference -0.41; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.07) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross-over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>PPI is not efficacious for cough associated with GORD symptoms in very young children (including infants) and should not be used for cough outcomes. There is insufficient data in older children to draw any valid conclusions. In adults, there is insufficient evidence to conclude definitely that GORD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GORD. Clinicians should be cognisant of the period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. Future paediatric and adult studies should be double-blind, randomised controlled and parallel-design, using treatments for at least two months, with validated subjective and objective cough outcomes and include ascertainment of time to respond as well as assessment of acid and/or non-acid reflux.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-18 16:10:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-18 16:10:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to general practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>). Worldwide, the desire to reduce the impact of the symptom of cough is reflected in the billions of dollars spent on over the counter cough and cold medications. Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>). Prolonged or chronic cough has been variously defined as a cough which persists for longer than three to eight weeks.</P>
<P>Gastroesophageal reflux (GOR) (reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus) can be acid or non-acid (volume or alkaline reflux) and these occur physiologically, especially in the post-cibal state (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>). When reflux is 'excessive', GOR disease (GORD) is present. Symptoms attributed to GORD range from a variety of gastrointestinal/abdominal symptoms (abdominal pain, halitosis, water brash etc.) to extra-oesophageal symptoms (cough, hoarseness, laryngeal problems, ear disease, dental erosion etc.) (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>). In 2006 and 2009, the definition of GORD was refined to "a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications" (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cohort studies in adults suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) related to acid causes 21% to 41% of chronic non-specific cough, even in many with no gastrointestinal symptoms of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1990</LINK>). When successfully treated, GORD-related cough is associated with a decrease in objective measurements of cough sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1994</LINK>). In animals, potent acid instillation into the oesophagus causes airway neurogenic inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Daoui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daoui 2002</LINK>). In adult humans similar experimentation causes cough in a temporal manner (within 70 seconds) (<LINK REF="REF-Ing-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1994</LINK>). Although a temporal relationship has been shown in the laboratory, cough is reported in some earlier studies to resolve only after a mean time period of 169 to 179 days following treatment for acid-GORD related cough (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2002a</LINK>). It is thus not surprising that conflicting data have been reported and others have shown that acid GORD is associated with, but not the causative factor for, cough. Also, effective treatment of GORD that resolves gastrointestinal GORD symptoms may have no effect on objective pulmonary data (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, like asthma and GORD, both GORD and cough are common diseases, often co-exist, and their association does not imply cause and effect (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). Nevertheless, several reviews/guidelines suggest a therapeutic trial of three to six months of GORD treatment for non-specific chronic dry cough in both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiljander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiljander 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current treatment for GORD includes conservative anti-reflux measures (diet, positioning etc.), pharmacological approaches (acid suppressing agents: histamine<SUB>2</SUB> (H<SUB>2</SUB>) receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and prokinetic agents: domperidone, erythromycin, metoclopramide and previously cisapride) and surgical approaches (Nissen or Toupet fundoplication by laparoscopic or open procedures) (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several definitions of GORD. Excessive distal oesophageal acidification is the most common clinical scenario of GORD and can be defined by the histological presence of reflux oesophagitis (on biopsy) or distal oesophageal pH-metry (24-hour pH study) (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>). Distal pH-metry is the most sensitive method for defining acid GORD and is a standard test recommended for evaluating chronic cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1998</LINK>). In children, acid GORD is present if distal pH-metry shows a reflux index (% time pH &lt; 4) of &gt; 10% in infants and &gt; 7% (3% to 7% considered indeterminate) in children aged over 12 months, as suggested by the GORD guidelines of the European and American paediatric gastroenterology groups (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>). Dual channel (proximal and distal) oesophageal pH-metry has also been used in assessing GORD with arguable clinical use even in the assessment of patients at risk for upper airway complications of GORD (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>). However, there is variation in what constitutes an abnormal reflux index; in adults the definition of abnormal pH-metry consistent with GORD varies from a reflux index of greater than 3.9% to 7.2% (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review examining the efficacy of the various treatment modalities for prolonged non-specific cough in adults and children and GORD would help clarify the link (or otherwise) between cough and GORD.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:16:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies examined whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This took into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment and estimated effect size. We included the results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest in the subsequent meta-analyses. In cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>), when data were combined with those from parallel studies, we only used effect estimates from the first arm (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). There is some debate over the handling of cross-over data (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) and we considered that it was invalid to use second-arm data given the known period effect of cough (i.e. cough tends to resolve with time (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>)) and the likely bias associated with carry-over effect (studies had short wash out time of two weeks compared to eight weeks of therapy in each arm).</P>
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, we calculated relative and absolute risk reductions using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that participants not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). For primary outcome, we calculated an estimate of the numbers needed to treat (NNT) for benefit (NNT-B) and harm (NNT-H) from pooled data with 'intention-to-treat' used as the denominator and calculated using the formula 1/risk difference (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). We defined event as successful treatment defined by absence of cough by end of treatment period.</P>
<P>We derived imputed correlation coefficient for calculating standard deviations of change from baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) from other studies in the review. We calculated the summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed-effect model) using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting. We pooled data from similar studies, assuming cough indices were normally distributed continuous variables. For cross-over studies, mean treatment differences were calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as a fixed-effect standardised mean difference using generic inverse variance (GIV). This gave a weighted SD unit difference and 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We tested heterogeneity between the study results to see if it reached statistical significance using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. We included the 95% confidence interval estimated using a random-effects model whenever there were concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We did not include gastrointestinal symptoms in the forest plots as it was not an objective of this review.</P>

<P>There were six studies in children; five in infants and one in children, with the most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 2009</LINK>) added in the 2010 update. Orenstein and colleagues' study described increased cough with thickened feeds as an intervention in a diverse group of infants with cough and GORD (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 1992</LINK>). Although most in the group were otherwise well infants, some had primary respiratory disease (hence did not have non-specific cough). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>) reported on the use of specific anti-regurgitation formula milk (as opposed to thickened formula) in infants with GORD that included cough as an outcome measure. However, <LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK> did not provide data specific to cough in the publication. Orenstein and colleagues' study described increased cough with thickened feeds as an intervention in a diverse group of infants with cough and GORD (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 1992</LINK>). Although most in the group were otherwise well infants, some had primary respiratory disease (hence did not have non-specific cough). Three studies were supported (one in part) by the manufacturers of the milk utilised (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>) and we excluded the other (<LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2003</LINK>) because it was an open non-randomised (but controlled) trial. Outcome measures of the four studies on infants varied: in two multi-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>), cough was reported as part of a symptom complex (with gag or choke, etc.) and although the authors provided further information, the data could not be used for analysis in this review. In one study only a small number of infants had cough (nine of 81) (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK>) displayed in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (no significant difference between groups).</P>
<P>There was a single RCT on PPI in infants (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 2009</LINK>) and the authors provided additional data specific to cough outcomes that were not available in the publication. There were no controlled trials on surgery in infants.</P>
<P>The single study in children (<LINK REF="STD-Dordal-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dordal 1994</LINK>) included children with asthma; its exclusion criteria were insufficiently defined to allow classification of participants as having non-specific cough and it is unclear if the study was a randomised study. There were no controlled trials on the use of PPIs or surgery in children.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adults</HEADING>
<P>In adults, 13 studies were included; eleven were published articles, one in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Kopec-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kopec 2001</LINK>) and one in a conference report plus abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>).

Although all studies included cough that was presumed associated with GOR, criteria for entry into the studies varied. In six studies, participants enrolled through the otolaryngology department and had 'laryngitis' symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wo 2006</LINK>). One study based in medical clinics also primarily enrolled participants with chronic 'laryngitis' (<LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>). In these studies where subjects were recruited from otolaryngology clinics, primary lung disease (such as asthma defined by hyper-responsiveness) as an exclusion criteria were not as stringent as they were in the studies enrolled through medical outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaspersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jaspersen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK>). Mean age of participants reported in studies was 46 to 58 years (range 18 to 80 years). Some studies had predominantly males (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK>) whereas others had predominantly females (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wo 2006</LINK>). Two studies had similar proportions of males to females (<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>). In all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jaspersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jaspersen 1999</LINK>), presence of GOR (or extra-oesophageal reflux) was confirmed objectively. However in <LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK> only 29% of participants had pH-metry characteristics of GORD. In most studies the diagnosis of GOR was made with pH-metry, and some included dual channels. None of the studies used alkaline or volume reflux as an entry criteria although oesophageal manometry was used in two studies.</P>
<P>There were 10 parallel studies and three cross-over studies, all of which had wash-out periods of two weeks. Ten studies compared PPI to placebo but varying doses and frequencies were used. Studies involving participants with 'laryngitis' (<LINK REF="STD-El-Serag-2001" TYPE="STUDY">El Serag 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>) generally used higher doses of PPI (twice-daily regime). Three studies used omeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK>), one used esomeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>) and the other three studies used a different PPI, pantoprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wo 2006</LINK>), rabeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>) and lansoprazole (<LINK REF="STD-El-Serag-2001" TYPE="STUDY">El Serag 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>). One study compared PPI to ranitidine (<LINK REF="STD-Jaspersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jaspersen 1999</LINK>) and another was a two-factorial design using cisapride and diet intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kopec-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kopec 2001</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>) all subjects (i.e. both controls and intervention groups) also received instructions for lifestyle modification. There was a single study on H<SUB>2</SUB>-antagonist versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>), published only as a report on an oral presentation and abstract format. Data from this study were presented graphically (provided by the author) and could not be used as points on the graph were unclear (number in the study did not equate to the number of points on the graph). There were no randomised controlled studies assessing surgical interventions.</P>
<P>Length of intervention in the study on H<SUB>2</SUB>-antagonist versus placebo was two weeks each (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>). In the studies using PPI, length of intervention was two to three months (or eight to 12 weeks) and two studies had prolonged follow up post-trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK>). Outcome measures for all studies were subjective cough scales of varying types. Two studies had outcome assessments done midway through trial (<LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>), one had several evaluations during the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>) but only one of these studies provided 'during trial' cough data in the paper (<LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>). Objective cough monitoring was not used in any study. In all but one study, gastrointestinal or 'extra-oesophageal' symptoms of GORD were also outcome measures. Adverse events were specifically mentioned in six studies.</P>

<P>There were insufficient data in infants and children that could be combined for display in the graphs as trials in infants were too dissimilar. The studies on formula-thickening (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>) in infants found improvement in GORD symptoms referring to the gastrointestinal system but data for effect on cough were inconsistent. The smaller study (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 1992</LINK>) described a significant increase in cough frequency post-feeds when thickened feeds were given (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The multicentre study described decrease in percentage of feeds associated with cough/gag/choke episodes in infants given pre-thickened milk (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>). Cough/gag/choke was grouped as a secondary outcome and scored in a binary manner in the study of Vanderhoof and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>). We sought additional information which was provided but the authors were unable to provide data on cough alone (cough was included in symptom complex with choke or gag or cough). In the <LINK REF="STD-Chao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2007</LINK> study, the number of children with cough was small (n = 9 out of 81 infants who completed the study) and the difference between groups was not significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Moukarzel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moukarzel 2007</LINK> study, although cough was an outcome measure, cough-specific data were not presented in the paper. In the excluded study Xinias and colleagues found no effect of the anti-regurgitation formula milk on cough (<LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2003</LINK>). No adverse events were reported in of these studies.</P>
<P>The sole study on PPI in paediatrics found no significant difference in cough outcomes between infants in the lansoprazole and placebo groups. When all children were considered the mean difference of % days with cough (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) between groups was not significant (MD 8.60; 95% CI -2.85 to 20.05). There was also no difference between groups (OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.55) (95% CI = NNT-B of 11 to NNT-H of 8) when only infants who had a cough at baseline were considered (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). For both cough outcomes, the data favoured the placebo group. Orenstein and colleagues also described "no difference in efficacy between lansoprazole and placebo for symptoms attributed to GERD in infants" (<LINK REF="STD-Orenstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Orenstein 2009</LINK>). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (as defined by authors) were significantly more common in the PPI group (OR 5.56; 95% CI 1.18 to 26.25 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), with NNT-H in four weeks of 11 (95% CI 3 to 232), depicted in a Cates plot (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

The studies that utilised other PPIs (lansoprazole, rabeprazole or pantoprazole) (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>) showed no significant benefit of PPI over placebo. Within each subgroup, there was no significant heterogeneity and the between-group test for difference between omeprazole and the other PPIs was non-significant (SMD -0.45; 95% CI -1.13 to 0.23). This subgroup analysis was <I>post hoc</I>. <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>, the two studies that used omeprazole, were also the studies that reported data at week four and whilst the study drugs may have an effect over a longer period than one month, the evidence from our analyses should be cautiously applied for several reasons. Firstly the sample sizes of the trials were small and the sensitivity of the symptom scales is as yet unqualified. However, data from the two cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>) assessing mean change in symptoms may confer some validity to the notion that there is an effect on symptom change.

<P>Determination of time to respond and duration of treatment effect was limited.

In one cross-over study, cough resolved while on omeprazole in two adults but recurred in the washout phase (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>). One study that reported time to response (<LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK>) was also the only paper that had follow up post-trial (open non-RCT followed the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel trial).

<P>In contrast to the paediatric data, none of these adult studies reported any significant adverse events to interventions and hence 'number needed to harm' was not relevant in this review.

Another study (<LINK REF="STD-El-Serag-2001" TYPE="STUDY">El Serag 2001</LINK>) described that a higher proportion of participants in the PPI group (86%) had a complete response when compared to the placebo group (40%) but no significant difference in laryngoscopy assessment. One study described no difference between PPI and placebo in total score but an improvement in cough score in favour of PPI, yet the objective score in reflux (by video laryngoscopy) significantly favoured the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>).

<P>Limiting the analysis to studies with higher quality scores (Jadad score of five, as in previous versions) did not change the primary outcome (proportions not cured) with an OR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.35) (all-inclusive effect estimate was OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.15). It was not possible to perform this on other outcomes. Varying the inclusion criteria by removing studies of participants enrolled from otolaryngology clinics also did not change the primary outcome (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.73). Varying inclusion criteria by limiting studies to participants with 'laryngitis' also did not change the primary outcome (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.49). It was again not possible to test this effect on other outcomes. Varying the inclusion criteria by removing studies of participants enrolled from medical clinics did not alter non-significance of results (altered 'change in cough score' outcome from all-inclusive SMD -0.39; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.08 to SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.35). 'Mean cough score at end of trial' did not significantly change when medical clinic studies were omitted(SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.97 to 0.28) and analysis was not possible for the primary outcome. It was not possible to test for analysis for medication class type or study size because of all studies were small and only studies on PPI could be used in meta-analysis. Analysis by treatment received did not change the primary outcome, i.e. proportions not cured (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.44). As analyses for other outcomes were performed on 'treatment received' (intention-to-treat analysis was not possible), this was not repeated for the other three outcomes. There was no difference in results when we used a random-effects model in all outcome measures. When, however, data from both arms of the cross-over studies were treated as parallel studies, we found a significant difference between week eight and week four (SMD -0.76; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.25) suggesting that the non-significant effect is possibly related to a small sample size.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:23:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review of 19 studies (six in infants/children and 13 in adults) has shown a lack of high-level evidence that the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) associated cough improves cough measured by subjective methods (i.e. subjective cough). Studies on milk formula-thickening yielded inconsistent results and the single randomised controlled trial (RCT) on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in paediatrics (162 children) found no significant difference between groups for cough as primary outcome (95% CI of number needed to treat for benefit (NNT-B) of 11 to number needed to treat for harm (NNT-H) of eight) or other cough outcomes. Importantly, serious adverse events, particularly lower respiratory tract infections, occurred significantly more frequently in the lansoprazole group compared with the placebo group, the NNT-H after four weeks was 11 (95% CI 3 to 232). In adults, there was no significant effect in the pooled analysis and the beneficial effect was seen only in the subgroup analysis. The OR for cough resolution pooled from four adult studies was not statistically significant (NNT-B of 4 to NNT-H of 90). This review also highlights the large placebo and time period effect of treatment for chronic cough.</P>
<P>The beneficial effects of PPI for cough and GORD were inconsistent. The only significant differences were change in cough scores at the end of studies which used omeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>; both these studies also reported four weeks change at which time point there was no significant difference in change in cough scores) and in the generic inverse variance (GIV) analysis of cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>). Non-significant changes were found in the primary outcome measure of failure to cure, as well as in mean cough score at end of trial (borderline non-significant) and when all studies were combined for change in cough score at end of trial analysis. While a possible contributor to this is the lack of power, another possible contributor to the inconsistent and small treatment effect is that, as cough and GORD are both common symptoms, the presumed GORD-related cough was not caused by GORD. This explanation suggests that in a high proportion of cases of presumed GORD-related cough, there is in fact an alternative cause for the persistent cough. Indeed cough is the most common symptom presenting to doctors (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>). Both GOR and cough are common diseases, which often co-exist and this association does not imply cause and effect (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1999</LINK>). Indeed the probability of both symptoms co-existing merely by chance is high, and cough can induce reflux episodes as described in asthma and GORD literature (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zerbib-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerbib 2002</LINK>). However, our finding of an effect of therapy with PPI to improve cough when measured using change scores at the end of the trials does suggest that in a proportion of cases of chronic cough with associated GORD, GORD could be a contributing cause of cough. However, the non-significant NNT is relatively large at 12 (95% CI NNT-B of 4 to NNT-H of 90).</P>
<P>Other possible influences on the results of this review include degree of acid inhibition achieved, duration of therapy, outcomes of cough measured, and type of GORD (acid versus non-acid/volume reflux). The degree of acid inhibition achieved in the treatment is probably a small factor, if it is a factor at all, given that in the majority of studies resolution of GORD symptoms (of the gastrointestinal system) was achieved. However, it is also possible that different degrees of acid suppression are required to control the different manifestations of GORD. Subjective cough outcomes were variable between studies and in all studies the diary systems used were unvalidated. Subjective cough monitoring is subject to various influences (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>) and less reliable than objective cough monitoring in both adults (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>). In large RCTs, the influence of the type of outcome measures should be equal in both arms, but if one medication is more likely to improve symptoms other than cough, cough-specific symptom reporting may be differentially influenced. This is relevant as in the majority of included studies resolution of other GORD symptoms was achieved, which may have influenced cough-specific reporting.</P>
<P>Some clinical heterogeneity was present in the participants of the studies included as the majority but not all participants enrolled from otolaryngology clinics had cough. However, using separate analysis the direction of change in favour of PPI use was the same in patients enrolled from medical or from otolaryngology clinics. Indeed, excluding patients from otolaryngology clinics (or with laryngitis) did not alter the level of statistical significance of the primary outcome. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity in studies between omeprazole and other PPIs, but these data are limited by small sample sizes and different doses used by the different groups of trialists. The studies using omeprazole used either 40 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>) or twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>), while the dosage for lansoprazole was 30 mg twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Havas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Havas 1999</LINK>), rabeprazole was 20 mg twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>) and pantoprazole was 40 mg twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>). Other outcome analysis would not be possible without the studies based in otolaryngology clinics, which would have resulted in non-significant changes in all the outcomes shown in the forest plots, with the exception of change in cough scores at the end of intervention which was significant in the single medical clinic study with data available. Another recent systematic review on laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LPR) (where cough is often a dominant symptom), concluded that "high-dose proton pump inhibitor is no more effective than placebo in producing symptomatic improvement or resolution of laryngo-pharyngeal symptoms" (<LINK REF="STD-Gatta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gatta 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resolution of cough in response to effective treatment is the ideal outcome in these trials. However a clinically significant improvement, rather than total resolution of cough, may be relevant and acceptable to patients with poor quality of life. The magnitude of change in cough score that constitutes a clinically relevant improvement is unknown. The NNT for clinical significant improvement (as opposed to cough resolution) is unknown.</P>
<P>Data on length of therapy required to achieve a change in cough score are inconsistent. One study reported significant improvement after two weeks of H<SUB>2</SUB>-antagonist in all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>), which is a less potent acid-suppressing agent than PPI (<LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ours-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ours 1999</LINK> made specific reference to the response time of five to 14 days in those whose cough was relieved by PPI in the open-label phase. However, in the meta-analysis limited to two studies where outcomes at four weeks were available (<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>), a trend to improvement was seen at week four and again at eight weeks but this was not statistically significant. If data from cross-over trials were analysed as parallel trials (i.e. as first-arm data), there was a significant difference between week eight and week four cough scores. While data on length of therapy is inconclusive, results from this review suggest that a trial of at least eight to nine weeks would be long enough to expect a significant improvement. This is also supported by a RCT comparing two doses of lansoprazole (30 mg twice-daily to 30 mg daily). In participants whose cough responded to lansoprazole, the response was seen by four weeks and extended therapy (12 weeks) conferred no significant additional benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2006</LINK>). There is no RCT data to support recommendations of a six-month therapy trial, in contrast to uncontrolled observations, that GORD-associated cough takes a mean of a five to six months to take effect (<LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>PPIs are currently the most potent non-surgical intervention for acid-GORD and no adverse events were reported in these studies. The use of these medications as a trial of therapy thus probably has little risk. However, an epidemiological study reported that adults on PPI or H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist have an increased risk of having community-acquired pneumonia (adjusted relative risk of 1.89 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.62) and 1.63 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.48) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Laheij-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laheij 2004</LINK>)). This risk translates to "approximately one case of pneumonia for every 100 years of patient exposure" (<LINK REF="REF-Gregor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregor 2004</LINK>). Another study described an increased risk of hip fractures associated with PPI use; the adjusted odds ratio for hip fracture associated with more than one year of PPI therapy was 1.44 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.59) (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2006</LINK>). Moreover, use of PPI has been reported to cause cough (<LINK REF="REF-Howaizi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howaizi 2003</LINK>) and the package insert for omeprazole includes cough as an adverse event in 1.1% of adults. In contrast to pharmaceutical interventions, there were no randomised studies on surgical intervention, which carries a small but significant rate of serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Some authors suggest that cough in association with GORD related to acid reflux can occur with normal pH-metry and indices (i.e. require reflux index of 0%), and that cough can take a prolonged time (a year) to settle post-GORD intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2002b</LINK>). Such assertions are difficult to prove or disprove in the context of the difficulties with using cough as the primary outcome measure in studies and the feasibility of the required studies. The difficulties relating GORD to cough as causative (as opposed to an association) has been recently summarised (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eastburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastburn 2007</LINK>). There is discordance between cough guidelines produced by adult respiratory groups (which assert that GORD is a common cause of cough) to those originating from gastroenterology societies (which assert that the cause and effect is unclear) (<LINK REF="REF-Vakil-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakil 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2009</LINK>) when attributing cough and GORD. However, considerations of non-acid reflux require further studies and perhaps multichannel intraluminal electrical impedance monitoring, said to be a more sensitive alternative technology for evaluating all types of GORD (acid and non-acid) (<LINK REF="REF-Shay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shay 2004</LINK>) may prove useful.</P>

<P>The validity of this systematic review is hindered by the disparate nature of the interventions considered and the resulting small number studies, with only selected availability of unpublished data. Given the distribution of effects for the primary outcome, this may be a reason to suspect publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Furthermore although 19 studies were identified, data could only be used for a subset of them. Our efforts to obtain numerical outcome data from a number of investigators have only been partially successful. This review is also limited by a lack of validated scales and objective data on cough as well as a lack of allocation concealment data and possibly by clinical heterogeneity of participants and medications. The review is primarily concerned with people who do not have primary lung disease but this as an exclusion factor could not be stringently applied in all studies. In all but four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wo 2006</LINK>), participants were selected for gastro-intestinal symptoms or objective evidence of GORD and most but not all participants had cough. GORD criteria also varied between studies which may influence results. Most studies did not utilise GORD criteria specified by guidelines published by American and European Gastrointestinal Associations (<LINK REF="REF-AMA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMA 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudolph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudolph 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 1993</LINK>). There are also no data on non-acid reflux.</P>

<P>The review process was protected from bias by following a pre-published protocol. We minimised bias by assessing studies independently and resolving differences of opinion by discussion. Data extraction was also performed in duplicate to reduce bias. We also contacted almost all authors for additional data. Many provided unpublished data (see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK> section) which reduced potential bias. However authors from one large negative study (<LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>) did not provide additional data and it is likely that inclusion of data from this study into the meta-analysis (for 'change in cough score' outcome) would add to the doubt of benefit of PPIs for cough in adults.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>In contrast to the small effect of GORD treatment on cough found in RCTs, in non-controlled trials (see<I> </I>
<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) the improvement rate of surgical intervention for GORD-associated cough has been reported to be as high as 92% (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2003</LINK>) with cure rates as high as 81% (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2003</LINK>). For non-surgical intervention, e.g. with PPI alone (<LINK REF="STD-Habermann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Habermann 2002</LINK>) or PPI with motility agents (<LINK REF="STD-Poe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Poe 2003</LINK>), cough improvement rates of 86% to 100% have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Habermann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Habermann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Poe 2003</LINK>). The large difference between the effect of treatment of GORD on cough seen in randomised controlled and uncontrolled trials is likely related to the period effect and/or placebo effect also reported in other treatments for cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). The placebo effect of cough treatments has been reported to be as high as 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2002</LINK>). The high rate of placebo effect was specifically highlighted in two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noordzij-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noordzij 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cough and gastrointestinal symptoms of GORD are common ailments and the presence of both symptoms by chance is high (in a cohort of patients with chronic cough, the chance occurrence maybe as high as 25%) (<LINK REF="REF-Eastburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastburn 2007</LINK>). There is insufficient evidence to conclude that in adults GORD treatment with PPI for cough associated with GORD is beneficial. The beneficial effect was only seen in secondary subgroup analysis and is small. Given the significant morbidity of chronic cough in many patients, a trial of therapy with PPI in adults with chronic cough and GORD maybe considered but has to be balanced with the reported increased (but small) risk of pneumonia in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Laheij-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laheij 2004</LINK>) on acid suppressant therapy. If a therapeutic or empiric trial of PPI is undertaken for treatment of cough, symptom improvement seems most likely to occur by two to eight weeks, although the optimal duration is uncertain. We would thus recommend that empiric trials not be abandoned before eight weeks until better evidence is available. However, the period effect (natural resolution with time) of cough is significant. Clinicians should also be cognisant of the large influence of placebo intervention seen in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. It is probable that a proportion of adult patients with chronic cough are subjected to longer-term PPI because of an initial apparent response due to this placebo effect, when their cough is in fact not caused by their incidental GORD. There is insufficient data to support (or refute) common recommendations of diet manipulation or use of motility agents either as a single agent or in conjunction with PPIs in the management of GORD and cough.</P>
<P>In children, based on current data, PPIs should not be used empirically. The single relatively large high quality study on the utility of PPI for cough associated with GORD found no beneficial effect in infants and those on lansoprazole had significantly increased serious adverse events, in particular lower respiratory infections. Data on milk modification for infants and cough with GORD is insufficient to make specific recommendations. Until more evidence is available in the form of well-designed RCTs, other causes of cough should be considered in children with cough and GORD, prior to any consideration of empiric treatment with a prolonged course of GORD medications/interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-15 13:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Despite the widely advocated proposal that GORD-associated cough is common and that prolonged treatment is required, there is a paucity of RCT data on how effective GORD management is in treating cough associated with GORD. Sufficiently powered RCTs examining time for improvement and resolution of cough as well as optimal duration of therapy using valid cough outcomes are required. These cough outcomes should include objective tools (e.g. ambulatory cough monitors) and validated subjective cough instruments, such as cough specific quality if life instruments (<LINK REF="REF-Birring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birring 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newcombe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcombe 2008</LINK>) and cough diaries (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>). Studies on prediction of response to treatment would also be useful for clinical practice. The significant time period effect and placebo influences on cough as a symptom would render open label studies difficult to interpret. Design of future RCTs should be parallel and placebo-controlled, and have sufficient follow-up time post-trial to evaluate the possible carry-over effect or recurrence of cough post-cessation of therapy. All three cross-over studies reported a significant carry-over effect (<LINK REF="STD-Eherer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eherer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ing-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiljander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiljander 2003</LINK>); cross-over designed studies should therefore not be repeated. Objective measurement of reflux (acid and non-acid) whilst on therapy would also be beneficial. Given the possible significant harm of surgical intervention and the recommendation of surgical intervention if cough does not resolve with non-surgical intervention for cough presumed associated with GORD symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1998</LINK>), the need for a randomised controlled study of surgical intervention is substantial. Respiratory illness and pharmacokinetics of medications (<LINK REF="REF-Sinaiko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinaiko 2001</LINK>) in children are sufficiently different to that in adults to warrant separate studies on children using child-appropriate valid outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in infants with symptomatic GORD who remained symptomatic with crying, fussing, or irritability (designated 'crying' hereinafter) during or within 1 hour after feeding despite at least 1 week of non-pharmacologic management (NPM). NPM consisted of: (1) reduction of tobacco smoke exposure, (2) 1 or more feeding strategy (frequent burping, frequent small feedings, use of hypoallergenic and thickened formula, or dairy avoidance by breast-feeding mother), and (3) 1 or more positioning strategy (minimising seated and awake supine positioning, avoiding vigorous handling, particularly post-feeding). Symptomatic GORD defined by score on validated Orenstein GORD questionnaire (I-GERD-MH)</P>
<P>Study comprised of 3 periods: pretreatment (1 to 2 weeks before randomisation), treatment (maximum 4 weeks of study drug treatment), and post-treatment. Infants were further screened through parental completion of the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Medical History (I-GERQ-MH) and by 7 to 14 days of NPM before randomisation</P>
<P>In pretreatment phase, parents were required to institute and record in a daily diary NPM strategies and outcomes. Randomisation qualification was then assessed - eligible if NPM failed to reduce meal-related crying to &lt; 25% of all feedings during the final 4 pretreatment period days</P>
<P>Treatment phase: after 1 week of double-blind treatment, infants discontinuing the treatment due to inefficacy (as judged by the site investigator) were eligible for open-label lansoprazole at the investigator&#8217;s discretion and with parent consent</P>
<P>Post-treatment phase: telephone calls and a safety follow-up visit with global symptom assessment (GA) of symptoms 30 days after the last dose of any study drug (double-blind or open-label). The subjects also completed daily diaries for 7 days before the safety follow-up visit</P>

<P>The primary outcome measures: change in total reflux symptom scores and proportion of subjects noting significant global improvement. The reflux symptom scores were modification of a previously validated GERD outcome questionnaire that included laryngo-pharyngeal symptoms. The questionnaire included 9 items (heartburn, acid regurgitation, dysphagia, globus, throat clearing, hoarseness, sinus drainage or phlegm, sore throat and dry cough). Patients responded to frequency of symptoms (never, monthly, weekly, several times per week or daily) and severity of symptoms (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe), both scored 0 to 4 on a Likert scale. The total reflux symptom score included sum of frequency and severity scores for all items</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were change in SF36, change in laryngeal grading of videostrobolaryngoscopy, and changes in component reflux symptoms scores (frequency, severity, "typical," "laryngeal," "pharyngeal" and individual symptoms).

<P>The Airways Group specialised register/search identified 763 potentially relevant titles in the original search in 2004. After assessing the abstracts, 84 papers were obtained for considered for inclusion into review. The main reason for non-eligibility of studies for review criteria was the non-controlled, non-randomised nature of the respective studies (<I>see </I>table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). One controlled but non-randomised study was also excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Xinias-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xinias 2003</LINK>). Eleven studies were included in the original version of the review (<I>see</I> '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'), and all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>) were single centre studies. The multicentre study (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 2003</LINK>) was also the only study supported by commercial interest then. In the 2005 update a further 11 articles were retrieved; one study was included (<LINK REF="STD-El-Serag-2001" TYPE="STUDY">El Serag 2001</LINK>) and the rest were excluded, with two described in the excluded table (<LINK REF="STD-El-Hennawi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El Hennawi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Issing-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Issing 2004</LINK>). Following the 2006 search update, eight papers were retrieved. One RCT in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Vaezi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vaezi 2006</LINK>) was included and another RCT was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2006</LINK>) as a placebo was not used. The excluded study compared two doses of lansoprazole for adults with chronic cough (<LINK REF="STD-Baldi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baldi 2006</LINK>). Following the 2007 search update, 407 abstracts were reviewed, 12 papers were retrieved; none fulfilled eligibility criteria. One study that was excluded but should be highlighted was that of a controlled (but non-randomised) trial on fundoplication for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) of which 30% to 31% of the subjects had chronic cough, the 2nd or 3rd most common symptom (<LINK REF="STD-Swoger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swoger 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Swoger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swoger 2006</LINK> described no difference between groups at one year, despite technical success of the fundoplication. A systematic review on the efficacy of PPIs for LPR was also excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Gatta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gatta 2007</LINK>). The paper (<LINK REF="STD-Gatta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gatta 2007</LINK>) however revealed a relevant study that was not found in previous searches; this study (<LINK REF="STD-Steward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Steward 2004</LINK>) is now included in this update.</P>
