<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-27 15:09:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>The importance of human milk is well supported with the World Health Organization recommending that all infants should be fed exclusively on human milk from birth to six months of age and continued thereafter with appropriate complementary foods. Not all babies are able to feed at the breast and so expressed milk is needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Babies who do not receive human milk are more likely to suffer health problems both as newborns and later in life. Mothers may also want to express milk for their own comfort or to increase supply.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence to March 21, 2016 and identified 41 trials for inclusion involving 2293 participants, with 22 trials involving 1339 participants contributing data for analysis. Trials came from many countries and involved mothers of infants in neonatal units and healthy infants at home. The findings did not indicate a clear preference for any one pump type. Mothers reported satisfaction with relaxation and support interventions. There was no difference in milk contamination between methods or breast/nipple soreness of mothers.</P>
<P>Greater milk volume was expressed when mothers listened to music or had a relaxation protocol, warmed the breast, massaged the breast, pumped frequently with a suitable breast shield size and started pumping milk sooner after birth if the infant was unable to feed at the breast. Hand expression or a large electric pump provided a higher protein content than a manual pump. Hand expression provided higher sodium and lower potassium compared to pumps. Fat/lipid content was higher with breast massage when pumping. No evidence of difference in energy content was found between methods. No study asked mothers if they had achieved their own goals for expressing milk. None of the studies examined costs involved with the methods. Of the studies that evaluated pumps or products, 16 out of 30 had support from manufacturers. Not all the studies reported whether important basic supports for mothers were provided such as access to food and fluid, a place to rest near their baby, and the availability of knowledgeable health workers.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>The available evidence indicates that effective measures include starting to express milk soon after birth if the infant is unable to feed at the breast, relaxation, breast massage, warming of the breasts, hand expression, and use of low cost pumps.These may be as effective, or more effective, than large more costly electric pumps for some outcomes. The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Publications on breast milk pumping should not be taken to imply that use of a pump is a routine part of breastfeeding, rather, practitioners need to be able to justify the use of a pump for an individual mother prior to making a recommendation on its use.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-26 15:10:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>This updated review includes 41 trials involving 2293 participants, with 22 trials involving 1339 participants contributing data for analysis. Twenty-six of the trials referred to mothers of infants in neonatal units (n = 1547) and 14 to mothers of healthy infants at home (n = 730), with one trial containing mothers of both neonatal and healthy older infants (n = 16). Eleven trials compared one or more types of pump versus hand expression and 14 studies compared one type of pump versus another type of pump, with three of these studies comparing both hand expression and pump types. Twenty studies compared a specific protocol or adjunct behaviour including sequential versus simultaneous pumping protocols, pumping frequency, provision of an education and support intervention, relaxation, breast massage, combining hand expression with pumping and a breast cleansing protocol.</P>
<P>Due to heterogeneity in participants, interventions, and outcomes measured or reported, we were unable to pool findings for most of the specified outcomes. It was not possible therefore to produce a 'Summary of findings' table in this update. Most of the included results were derived from single studies. Trials took place in 14 countries under a variety of circumstances and were published from 1982 to 2015. Sixteen of the 30 trials that evaluated pumps or products had support from the manufacturers. The risk of bias of the included studies was variable.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>Only one of the 17 studies examining <B>maternal satisfaction/acceptability</B> with the method or adjunct behaviour provided data suitable for analysis. In this study, self-efficacy was assessed by asking mothers if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: &#8216;I don't want anyone to see me (hand expressing/pumping)&#8217;. The study found that mothers who were using the electric pump were more likely to agree with the statement compared to mothers hand expressing, (mean difference (MD) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.25; P = 0.01, participants = 68). Mothers who were hand expressing reported that the instructions for expression were clearer compared to the electric pump, (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.05; P = 0.02, participants = 68). Descriptive reporting of satisfaction in the other studies varied in the measures used, did not indicate a clear preference for one pump type, although there was satisfaction with some relaxation and support interventions.</P>
<P>We found no clinically significant differences between methods related to <B>contamination of the milk</B> that compared any type of pump to hand expression (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.61; P = 0.51, participants = 28), manual pump compared to hand expression, (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; P = 0.30, participants = 142) a large electric pump compared to hand expression (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.49; P = 0.61, participants = 123), or a large electric pump compared to a manual pump (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.26; P = 0.59, participants = 141)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>The level of <B>maternal breast or nipple pain</B> or damage was similar in comparisons of a large electric pump to hand expression (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.71; P = 0.96, participants = 68). A study comparing a manual and large electric pump, reported sore nipples in 7% for both groups and engorgement in 4% using a manual pump versus 6% using an electric pump; and in one study no nipple damage was reported in the hand-expression group, and one case of nipple damage in each of the manual pump and the large electric pump groups.</P>
<P>One study examined adverse effects on infants, however as the infants did not all receive their mothers' expressed milk, we have not included the results.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>The <B>quantity of expressed milk</B> obtained was increased, in some studies by a clinically significant amount, in interventions involving relaxation, music, warmth, massage, initiation of pumping, increased frequency of pumping and suitable breast shield size. Support programmes and simultaneous compared to sequential pumping did not show a difference in milk obtained. No pump consistently increased the <B>milk volume</B> obtained significantly.</P>
<P>In relation to <B>nutrient quality</B>, hand expression or a large electric pump were found to provide higher protein than a manual pump, and hand expression provided higher sodium and lower potassium compared to a large electric pump or a manual pump. Fat content was higher with breast massage when pumping; no evidence of difference was found for energy content between methods.</P>
<P>No consistent effect was found related to <B>prolactin change or effect on oxytocin release</B> with pump type or method. <B>Economic</B> aspects were not reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-27 15:09:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low-cost interventions including initiation of milk expression sooner after birth when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, massage, warming the breasts, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Variation in nutrient content across methods may be relevant to some infants. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings. Independently funded research is needed for more trials on hand expression, relaxation and other techniques that do not have a commercial potential.</P>

In both affluent and poorer communities, not receiving human milk may increase infant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victora-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 1987</LINK>). The long-term health of children may be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2004</LINK>): increased rates of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gdalevich-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gdalevich 2001</LINK>) and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Gerstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pettit-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettit 1997</LINK>) are associated with not receiving human milk, as well as less than optimal cognitive development (<LINK REF="REF-Bier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCrory-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrory 2011</LINK>) and increased risk of childhood obesity and markers of later cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labayen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labayen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2008</LINK>). Human milk may act as an analgesic to infants during procedures such as drawing blood (<LINK REF="REF-Upadhyay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upadhyay 2004</LINK>). The ability to express milk may improve the eventual breastfeeding of premature or ill infants (<LINK REF="REF-Furman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furman 2002</LINK>) and assist in sustaining breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Win-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Win 2006</LINK>) though expression of milk during the early postpartum days rather than feeding at the breast, may be a marker for earlier discontinuation of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not all babies are able to feed at the breast due to illness or abnormalities, prematurity, separation, and other reasons, and expressed milk is needed for these babies. Mothers may express their milk for their own comfort in situations of sore nipples (<LINK REF="REF-Buchko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchko 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 1985</LINK>); engorgement (<LINK REF="REF-Meserve-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meserve 1982</LINK>); to increase milk supply (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2001</LINK>); to provide milk if they are away from their baby (<LINK REF="REF-Geraghty-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geraghty 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hills_x002d_Bonczyk-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills-Bonczyk 1993</LINK>); for others to feed (<LINK REF="REF-Clemons-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 2010</LINK>); for their own preference to express and feed by bottle (<LINK REF="REF-Fein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fein 2008</LINK>); in situations of adoption (<LINK REF="REF-Auerbach-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auerbach 1981</LINK>) or surrogacy (<LINK REF="REF-Biervliet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biervliet 2001</LINK>); or to donate to a milk bank (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-COMA-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMA 1981</LINK>). There is a risk of HIV transmission via human milk. Expressing and heat-treating the milk will destroy the HIV, thereby providing a nutrient source to infants and young children, particularly in resource-poor areas (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 2004</LINK>). Research on human milk requires samples of milk, thus the ability and feasibility of milk expression is critical to this research (<LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamosh-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamosh 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mennella-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Mennella 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Picciano-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciano 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, a global programme of the WHO/UNICEF, requires that mothers be assisted to learn the skill of hand expression before discharge from maternity services (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 1989</LINK>). Learning this skill facilitates women to gain familiarity with functioning of their breasts and to see that they have milk thus building confidence, and empowers mothers with the skill to initiate milk production and to remove milk if their baby is not suckling without needing to purchase equipment. There is limited research on the best method of assisting learning how to express milk, the most appropriate situation or the competence of the person to assist this learning (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2012</LINK>). Information on the use of pumps is often provided by the pump manufacturing companies and may be more towards marketing and limited independent information on the relative effectiveness of different mechanical methods of pumping milk available.</P>
<P>Reports on economic aspects have demonstrated that the increased illness associated with not breastfeeding can increase parental income loss due to absence from work (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1995</LINK>) and increased healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Bachrach-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachrach 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ball-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartick 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2013</LINK>).

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-21 11:58:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>A baby removes milk from the breast by suckling with the tongue extended under and cupping the breast drawing it into the mouth. The baby&#8217;s oral movements compress the breast in a rhythmic motion. These movements create a changing pressure gradient assisting the flow of milk as well as stimulating release of the maternal hormone oxytocin which contracts the myoepithelial cells which surround the milk producing alveolar cells. This propels milk along the ducts towards the nipple. Milk expression and pumping techniques may focus on compression of the breast, the pressure gradient, assisting the release of oxytocin, or on a mixture of these stimuli.</P>
<P>A variety of methods to obtain milk have been examined (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egnell-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egnell 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feher-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Feher 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foda 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mersmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mersmann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitoulas-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitoulas 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sponsel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sponsel 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennergren-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennergren 1985</LINK>). The main aspects of methods are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> though imprecise terminology such as expression and pumping used interchangeably though physiologically different, can hinder comparability. Quantity of milk and acceptability to the mother may vary among methods of expression - hand expression, manual pumps, battery, or electric pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Clemons-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tengku-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tengku 2012</LINK>). Milk volumes and continuation of expression and of breastfeeding may be influenced by frequency of expression, proximity to infant, breast massage, combining methods, by using a double-pump system rather than single pumping, pump vacuum pressure and pattern, comfort of the pump, and for infants and mothers separated at birth, and how soon after birth expression commences (<LINK REF="REF-Acu_x00f1_a_x002d_Muga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuña-Muga 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopkinson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkinson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2009</LINK>). There may be differences between hand expressing or mechanical pumping, or both, to initiate milk supply, and expressing or pumping, or both, when the mother already has an established milk supply. A woman initiating milk production following the birth of her baby at 27 weeks' gestation and expecting to be exclusively pumping for many weeks before her baby is feeding at the breast is a very different situation than a woman pumping milk while she is away from her four-month old baby for eight hours at work and feeding directly at the breast other times. Colostrum and mature milk have different viscosity as well as volume. The most effective method may depend on the situation. Quality of milk constituents may vary depending on the method of expression or pumping, for example higher sodium in hand-expressed milk may be important for preterm infants, or differences in fat content (<LINK REF="STD-Garza-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Garza 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widdows-1933" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdows 1933</LINK>).

Expressing or pumping, particularly when conducted to provide milk for infants in neonatal units, can be stressful for mothers and supports can assist (<LINK REF="REF-Acu_x00f1_a_x002d_Muga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuña-Muga 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BLISS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BLISS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2013</LINK>). The stress experienced by mothers while expressing, and any support they receive, can be very important factors and should be considered in any analysis of expression.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:21:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Reports on expression of milk have appeared for many years, though most relate to the development of commercial pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Egnell-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egnell 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitoulas-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitoulas 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zoppou-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoppou 1997</LINK>). Much of the published research has limited outcomes, often focused on volume expressed in the shortest possible time, and few reports include the impact on ongoing breastfeeding or if mothers achieved their goals regarding expressing or pumping. Milk is expressed for a wide variety of reasons; different methods may better suit different purposes (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Expressed milk is used by healthy mothers and babies as well as in problem situations. Rates of milk expression and pumping appear to be rising (<LINK REF="REF-Binns-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binns 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clemons-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geraghty-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geraghty 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johns-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labiner_x002d_Wolfe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labiner-Wolfe 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Win-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Win 2006</LINK>). Research evidence is lacking towards understanding how pumped and bottle-fed human milk may differ from directly suckled milk and may affect outcomes in both child and mother (<LINK REF="REF-Felice-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felice 2015</LINK>). Many women, and their health advisors, rely on web sites for their information on expressing or pumping their milk, often from the manufacturers of pumps seeking to develop a market and increase sales. Reliance on commercial information has the potential to exacerbate health inequalities (<LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2015</LINK>). Environmental considerations including plastic waste from short-use milk collection sets, energy requirements and total life cycle environmental costs from high-tech pumps are being discussed more. There is a need for a review of the evidence about methods of expression of milk that is wider than comparisons of commercial pumps. This review addresses issues of effectiveness and acceptability of all methods of expressing human milk in addition to techniques to assist expressing or pumping.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk (insufficient information to permit the judgement of low or high risk).   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. When studies did not report any concealment approach, they were considered unclear. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>

<P>We considered that due to the nature of the interventions evaluated, blinding of mothers or their care providers to the intervention was generally not possible. For each study we have assessed if blinding would have been feasible and the effect so as to distinguish between unfeasible blinding and feasible, but not blinded. We assessed all studies for performance bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (no or incomplete blinding but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced; blinding of study participants and personnel ensured and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken);</LI>
<LI>high risk (outcome is likely to be influenced by no or incomplete blinding; blinding of study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk (insufficient information to access the risk of bias or the study did not address this outcome).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (no blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken);</LI>
<LI>high risk (no blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; or blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk (insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;low risk&#8217; or &#8216;high risk; if the outcome was not reported in the study, or clarity was not obtained through communication with the trialist when feasible). </LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We indicated for each included study, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we included the missing data in the analyses undertaken. We calculated the level of completeness to follow-up for all included studies but did not require a minimum level for inclusion. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. where there were no missing data or where reasons for missing data were balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk (e.g. where missing data may have related to outcomes or were not balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk (e.g. where there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit a judgement to be made).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and on our findings. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>In the notes sections of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table we have recorded any other concerns about bias such as source of funding, any significant deviation from the study protocol, or any extreme baseline imbalance. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (study appears to be free of other sources of bias);</LI>
<LI>high risk (at least one important risk of bias, e.g. had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk (insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists or insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We assessed cross-over trials to see what measures were used to reduce carry over between interventions, whereby the effects of an intervention given in one period persist into a subsequent period, thus interfering with the effects of the different, subsequent intervention. Depending on the outcome being assessed, we considered if any washout period between interventions was adequate as a means of reducing carry-over effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact on the findings. We planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses, temporarily removing studies at high risk of bias from the meta-analysis to see what impact this would have on intervention effects; however, the included studies were not suitable for meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update we planned to assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the specific outcomes. It was planned that <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool would be used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes would have been produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. However due to the variety in intervention and outcome measures, a 'Summary of findings' table was not created for this update. This will be re-examined in future updates. The following outcomes will be assessed.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Studies are presented in the same analysis when referring to a related outcome, however studies were not sufficiently similar to combine for meta-analysis. If further studies are identified in the future for meta-analysis, we will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and where we judge the trials&#8217; populations and methods to be sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if we consider an average treatment effect across trials clinically meaningful. We will treat the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.</P>

<P>
<B>Adverse outcomes/contamination</B>

<P>Adverse effects resulting from bacterial contamination of milk expressed by pump or hand expression were reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Costa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pittard 1991</LINK>), as well as infant death, infants developing necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK>).

<B>Transfer to feeding at the breast</B>
</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes of the review, <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2013</LINK>, reported on the proportion of infants breastfeeding on discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, and <LINK REF="STD-Vasan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vasan 2004</LINK> reported quantity of milk transferred on day of hospital transfer, which are used in this review as a proxy for transfer to feeding at the breast.</P>
<P>
<B>Effectiveness: quantity of milk and time taken</B>
</P>
<P>The quantity of milk expressed was examined in 34 studies with 18 studies providing data for analysis. The measures used in trials varied widely from a single expression to 60 days, which restricted comparison among trials (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Most studies instructed the mother to continue pumping until the milk flow slowed or ceased. A maximum time limit per pumping session was set in 12 studies (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Milk removal facilitates milk production (<LINK REF="REF-Wilde-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 1995</LINK>). If use of a pump on one or more occasions enables a mother to remove more milk, her milk production may also be higher on following occasions. Therefore, in a cross-over design comparing pumps, time-lag is important when measuring milk production outcomes: there needs to be sufficient time between pump tests (including any familiarisation period involving pumping) to allow for the effect of any additional milk produced to recede. Eight of the 13 cross-over studies that measured milk volume provided some information on familiarisation times and 'washout' periods and there does not appear to be a standard different time period used (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Frequency and duration of expression or pumping can also affect the quantity of milk. The frequency recommended or instructed in the trial and the frequency actually achieved by the women frequently differed (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The baby feeding at the breast immediately prior to a pumping session or baby feeding on the same days as daily pumped volumes were measured would affect the amount of milk measured as removed by the pump; however few of the studies measuring volume stated if the baby was also feeding at the breast during the trial.</P>
<P>Time taken to pump milk was examined in six studies with reference to sequential versus simultaneous pumping protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fewtrell-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Fewtrell 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prime-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prime 2012</LINK>); measures reported varied (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Time taken to pump with an additional support protocol was reported from one pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Heon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heon 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Effect on milk composition/nutrients</B>
</P>
<P>An aspect of nutrient content was measured in 16 studies. Fat/lipid content was measured in 15 studies with five reporting data in a format suitable for analysis in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Feher-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Feher 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keith-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Keith 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangel-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mangel 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stutte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stutte 1988</LINK>). Three studies provided data on other nutrients: protein, sodium, potassium and total energy (<LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>, unpublished data provided by author), protein, carbohydrate and total energy (<LINK REF="STD-Mangel-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mangel 2015</LINK>), total nitrogen (<LINK REF="STD-Garza-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Garza 1982</LINK>), and for two other studies the data were not in a format suitable for analysis: protein, lactose, and energy, (<LINK REF="STD-Bernabe_x002d_Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bernabe-Garcia 2012</LINK>), and energy, protein and carbohydrate content (<LINK REF="STD-Stellwagen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stellwagen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Maternal physiological effects </B>
</P>
<P>Maternal physiological effects of expressing or pumping or techniques or co-behaviours related to expressing and pumping are reflected in prolactin, oxytocin and cortisol hormone responses as well as other physiological changes. Nine studies reported a physiological effect, with data from three included for analysis: change in serum prolactin (<LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1995</LINK>), time to milk ejection (oxytocin release) (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 2008</LINK> (unpublished manuscript)), and one study with descriptive results included for prolactin and oxytocin response (<LINK REF="STD-Hopkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hopkinson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Economic implications</B>
</P>
<P>Length of stay in a neonatal unit is an important economic consideration, though the high number of variables in these infants makes the comparison difficult to evaluate. None of the included studies randomised infants. <LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK> reported on the median duration of infant stay in the hand-expression and pumping groups; however, these data were not used in this review as many infants were not receiving any of the milk their mothers expressed or pumped. Most of the studies mention staff assisting the mothers to use the methods of milk expression or pumping, though none explored the time cost of providing this assistance or if it varied between method or protocol.

<P>Of the 41 included studies, only one used quasi-randomisation (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=04906945052642140903110220234848&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Costa-1989">Costa 1989</A>). We judged two of the 41 RCTs to have high risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prime-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prime 2012</LINK>), 13 to have low risk of bias on both aspects, and another 13 trials to be low risk of bias on only one of these two aspects of allocation. For a further 11 trials, the adequacy of both the sequence generation and allocation concealment was unclear. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pittard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pittard 1991</LINK>) was graded as high risk for sequence generation and unclear risk for allocation concealment and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Prime-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prime 2010</LINK>) graded as low risk for sequence generation and high risk for allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2008</LINK> study had twice as many multipara (60%) in the intervention group as in the control group (30%), strongly indicating possible selection bias. As the outcome of interest is breastfeeding, the difference of mothers with prior breastfeeding experience could impact on the results of the study. It is therefore difficult to tell if the difference observed between mothers in the intervention and control group who were breastfeeding on discharge (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.21, P = 0.004) is due to the effectiveness of the intervention or the characteristics of the participants.</P>

<P>The study procedure used by <LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK> did not obtain the same number of further samples from all mothers participating in the study, with more samples being obtained only from mothers whose first sample was contaminated, and later results not reported in randomised groups, resulting in the erroneous finding reported that contaminated samples were more common in one method than the other.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lussier-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lussier 2015</LINK> to compare hand expression and electric pump was for 28 days however participants were in their assigned groups only for the first seven days; thereafter participants were allowed to change group and 18 of the 20 hand-expression group changed to using an electric pump. In the published paper, data analysis was reported by the original assigned groups and presented as cumulative volumes, which had the effect of enhancing any early differences and blurring later differences. Although difficult to match with the published data, the non-cumulative data for the first seven days as provided by the trialist in personal communication was used in this review.</P>
<P>In some studies results were reported as day/week one milk volume or constituents when it was more likely to mean day/week one of the trial rather than the first day after birth, as enrolment into the trial did not occur until some hours or days after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hopkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hopkinson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayamala-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayamala 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slusher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slusher 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yi_x011f_it-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yi&#287;it 2012</LINK>). Not all studies reported if milk expression was happening pre-trial enrolment (in the first few days after birth) and if so by what method.</P>
<P>Sixteen of the 30 studies which compared pumps or pumping related equipment stated that support was provided by the manufacturers of the equipment being studied plus one study received funding from the anti-bacterial agent studied. Studies have potential for bias when funded by manufacturers to test their products or to evaluate them compared to other products. Nine studies received funding from their academic institutions or not-for-profit organisations, with some studies receiving funding from more than one source (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common other bias with the studies (n = 33) was that they lack power to detect a statistically difference between their groups (as reported in published papers) and were rated as high risk for bias. Though power calculations tend not to be found in older studies conducted before current protocols were common, many of these studies were recent. Other biases that are common to other trials, such as possible contamination between groups, additional support to participants or just interest from the researcher, could also apply to these types of studies, as well as publication bias towards interesting results, results favourable to the funders, and English language.</P>

<P>Seventeen studies reported on maternal satisfaction in which there was comparison of various methods of milk expression that included simultaneous versus sequential breast pumping, different types of breast pumps as well as the effects of an educational and a relaxation intervention. One study provided data suitable for analysis in RevMan (<LINK REF="STD-Flaherman-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Flaherman 2012</LINK>). The methods examined in each study differed and the descriptive findings reported did not suggest any clear effect related to maternal satisfaction. Descriptive results, where available, are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two studies reported descriptively on maternal satisfaction in trials involving two different types of electric pumps. In a comparison of a standard to a novel small electric pump, <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Hopkinson-2009">Hopkinson 2009</A> (n = 62) reported that mothers' ranking of the two pumps did not differ on eight of 10 aspects of the pump, based on their experience in using the pump over two to three weeks. Examining another two pump brands, <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2013</LINK> (n = 71) reported a higher preference for a less costly pump based on its ease of use and the position of the control button than for the large electric pump, with no other items differing significantly between the groups.</P>
<P>The same manual pump (Avent ISIS) was preferred by women, using the same questionnaire and scale, both in a trial comparing it with a small electric/battery hand-held pump (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Fewtrell-2001a">Fewtrell 2001a</A>) and to a large electric pump (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Fewtrell-2001b">Fewtrell 2001b</A>). In a cross-over trial with mothers of term healthy infants aged approximately eight weeks (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Fewtrell-2001a">Fewtrell 2001a</A>) (n = 60), mothers' ratings of a small electric/battery and a manual pump over 48 hours of use are reported. Unpaired analysis of mothers' overall ratings of each pump was reported with no information provided on the within-mother rating of each pump. As a consequence of this, caution is required in the interpretation of the study&#8217;s results. Overall, mothers reported higher satisfaction with the manual pump but found no difference between the pumps for ease of use. A parallel group trial assessed mothers of preterm infants assigned to either a manual pump or a large electric pump within three days of giving birth and used for a range of seven to 30 days. This study also reported higher maternal satisfaction for the manual pump compared to the electric pump (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Fewtrell-2001b">Fewtrell 2001b</A>, n = 145).</P>
<P>Comparing a large electric versus a manual pump the subjective responses for each type of pump are reported as being similar apart from ease of operation, for which there was a marked preference (70%) for the electric pump (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Boutte-1985">Boutte 1985</A>). <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2011</LINK> (n = 39), comparing a manual and large electric pump, did not report their findings related to maternal views in the published paper.</P>
<P>In a cross-over study mothers alternated between hand expression and using a manual pump on postnatal days four and five and expressed a preference for the manual pump in both Phase I (n = 22) and in Phase II with a different sample, (n = 14), however, the Phase II sample also reported at postnatal days eight and nine and found the opposite at the later time, with a preference for hand expression at this time (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A cross-over trial comparing four manual pumps used by mothers with hospitalised preterm infants reported that the "scale of maternal preference rated higher those with the squeeze-handle mechanism than the cylindrical mechanism (p greater than 0.05)" (<LINK REF="STD-Bernabe_x002d_Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bernabe-Garcia 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Meier-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2008</LINK> (n = 65) reported there was "no significant difference" in the maternal evaluation of efficiency, efficacy, comfort or convenience in either group comparing two suction patterns of one large electric pump. <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2012</LINK> (n = 128) in a cross-over study examining varying breast pump suction patterns (BPSPs) descriptively reported "one statistically significant difference" was noticed that "mothers did not like the 'suction strength' of the new experimental maintenance BPSP" and mothers reporting that the new experimental maintenance BPSP was not as comfortable compared to the experimental initiation BPSP.</P>
<P>Comparing simultaneous versus sequential breast pumping, three studies reported on maternal satisfaction. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1990</LINK>, n = 25) reported a preference for simultaneous pumping compared to the single sequential option by three to one, while two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1999</LINK> (n = 49) and <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2001</LINK> (n = 52)) did not report any overall preference among mothers for either of these techniques.</P>
<P>Four studies looked at maternal satisfaction with other interventions to facilitate milk expression. <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=85259451456790012282110302192739&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Feher-1989">Feher 1989</A> (n = 55) examined the effect of a 20-minute audio relaxation and imagery tape to increase volume and fat content of milk pumped and reported that mothers were positive in their response on using the relaxation technique. <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2008</LINK> (n = 60) used the acquisition of knowledge and skills as an indicator of mothers reaching their goal of breastfeeding and reported that mothers who received an educational programme were more likely to start milk expression earlier compared to mothers in the control group (P &lt; 0.004). <LINK REF="STD-Mersmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mersmann 1993</LINK> (n = 18) reported that all mothers in this cross-over study found both the Theraputic Touch and the Mimic Theraputic Touch treatments helped them relax, and reported that "a chi-square analysis showed no significant difference in perception based on treatment order (<I>x</I>

<P>One RCT examined mothers self-reported efficacy using either hand expression or an electric pump (<LINK REF="STD-Flaherman-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Flaherman 2012</LINK>). Self-efficacy was assessed by asking mothers if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: &#8216;I don&#8217;t want anyone to see me (hand expressing/pumping)&#8217;. The study found that using a scale scored from one strongly disagree to five strongly agree, mothers who were using the electric pump were more likely to agree with the statement compared to mothers hand expressing (lower score is better) (mean difference (MD) 0.70, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.25; P = 0.01, participants = 68) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).

<P>Twenty studies, not all with data for analysis, examined techniques to increase the quantity of milk obtained that were unrelated to a type of pump. The techniques or associated protocols of providing relaxation, music, warmth, massage, initiation of pumping soon after birth if infant is not breastfeeding, increased frequency of pumping and suitable breast shield size, increased the quantity of milk obtained. Support programmes and simultaneous pumping compared to sequential pumping did not show a difference. The variable vacuum pattern with an electric pump indicated a marginal increase in milk quantity with one of the three patterns tested.</P>
<P>Providing a relaxation tape during the second week after birth to mothers with infants in a neonatal unit found a MD of 34.70 mL greater quantity in one from one pumping session than women not provided with the relaxation tape, which is a clinically significant amount (MD 34.70 mL, 95% CI 6.10 to 63.30; P= 0.02, participants = 55) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Feher-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Feher 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Providing any of three separate music-listening interventions of approximately 12 minutes duration to use while pumping by mothers of preterm infants (n = 160) obtained significantly more milk than the control group on all 14 days of the study with an increasing difference of quantity (mean over 14 days of study: control 166 mL, any music intervention 317.2 mL, range 297.5 to 449.9 mL) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Keith-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Keith 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exposure to music therapy sessions (flute) before and during pumping sessions over four days for mothers of preterm infants (n = 29) was reported by groups as resulting in a higher mean volume of 7.12 mL (SD 1.57 mL) compared to 6.68 mL (SD 1.37 mL) in the no music group (paired data were not available for this cross-over study so this finding should be interpreted with care) (<LINK REF="STD-Jayamala-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayamala 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therapeutic touch (TT) is a non-contact treatment where the therapy practitioner assumes a meditative awareness to focus on the energy-field of the recipient (here it is the mother), which can produce relaxation. <LINK REF="STD-Mersmann-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mersmann 1993</LINK> (n = 18) examined this treatment and reported for intra-participant analyses that "mothers expressed significantly more milk after TT than MTT (mimicTT) (EF = 0.75) or no treatment (EF = 0.85) (P &lt; 0.05)" (EF = effect size).</P>
<P>Massage of the breast with pumping showed a higher quantity obtained over two pumping sessions compared to no massage (MD 4.82 mL, 95% CI 1.25 to 8.39; P = 0.008, participants = 72 (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>) in a cross-over study with paired analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Stutte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stutte 1988</LINK>).

<P>Warming the breast compared to a non-warmed breast reported that mothers (n = 39) pumped a MD over all sessions of 11.94 mL with more milk during five of six pumping sessions over three days (MD 11.94mL, 95% CI 7.94 to 15.94; participants = 468; studies = six) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Yi_x011f_it-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yi&#287;it 2012</LINK>). No baseline measurements were reported for the mothers prior to taking part in the trial and thus it is unknown if the intervention of warming the breast significantly increased the production of milk or if the differences found between breasts were independent of the intervention.</P>
<P>Three different breast shield sizes for pumping were examined and reported that mothers (n = 20) removed more milk when they used a breast shield size that was greater than 24 mm (paired data were not available for this cross-over study so this finding should be interpreted with care) (<LINK REF="STD-Prime-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prime 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initiation of milk pumping within 60 minutes of birth of a very low birthweight infant obtained higher mean milk quantity at all times measured in the first week than the group who initiated pumping later (mean group total of all milk volume days one to seven, 1374.7 mL versus 608.1 mL, P = 0.05, n = 20 <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2012</LINK>). A cross-over study (n = 25) descriptively reported that increased frequency of pumping (four or more times per day) was associated with greater milk quantity than infrequent pumping (three or less times a day) (mean 342, SD 229 mL versus 221, SD 141 mL, P greater than 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Carvalho-1985" TYPE="STUDY">De Carvalho 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two structured support programmes to assist women with milk expression for their very low birth weight infant in a neonatal unit found the milk quantity showed little difference between the groups at various time points (<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Heon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pinelli 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Simultaneous compared to sequential pumping with an electric pump was examined in five studies and did not show difference in milk quantity in two parallel group studies providing data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1995</LINK>;; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 1999</LINK>), (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>), or in a cross-over study and paired two-tailed test of differences between the means of unlimited time simultaneous versus unlimited time sequential pumping that was reported as "non-significant" by <LINK REF="STD-Auerbach-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Auerbach 1990</LINK>.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-09-27 15:13:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>Milk expression occurs for a wide variety of reasons in a variety of settings and using a variety of measures, methods, techniques and equipment and thus a variety of outcomes is not unexpected. A mother initiating her milk production and then maintaining her supply and pumping eight times a day for her very preterm infant who is likely to be in a neonatal unit for three months has very different needs related to milk expression than a mother of a full-term healthy baby who feeds well at the breast and the mother expressing milk a few times a week. Consistent, clinically relevant differences in outcomes for milk expression were positively related to techniques such as initiation of pumping soon after birth if the infant is not breastfeeding, increased frequency of pumping, warming of breast, massage of breast and various methods to encourage relaxation. These techniques are likely to be relevant and useful to mothers expressing in any situation. There were no clear differences for outcomes from comparisons of pumps.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:33:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Maternal satisfaction with milk expression was reported in 17 out of the 41 included studies and among these, only one study provided any data suitable for analysis in RevMan, and it favoured hand expression. The descriptive findings reported did not suggest any clear consistent effect related to maternal satisfaction.</P>
<P>There were insufficient studies to show results for infant morbidity related to mother's method of milk expression. There was no difference in the incidence of milk contamination or normal milk bacterial flora found between hand expression and mother&#8217;s own choice of any manual pump or between hand expression, a manual pump and an electric pump. Adverse effects related to the mothers such as nipple or breast pain were reported in three studies and showed no difference between methods, though in all these studies the actual numbers reporting adverse effects were small.</P>
<P>It was not possible to answer the question of whether a method of expression was related to the likelihood of the infant in a neonatal unit transferring to breastfeeding at an earlier or later time. Some mothers may provide milk for their preterm infant but not wish to put their baby to the breast at any time, or the condition of the infant may make feeding fully at the breast unlikely. Though the WHO recommendation is to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months, this may not be what mothers intend to do even if adequate support is available. Any study examining this outcome measure would need to be specifically designed to do so and take into account maternal intentions.</P>
<P>The findings reported in earlier versions of this review were further strengthened in this update that an increased quantity of milk was obtained with methods to encourage relaxation, Therapeutic Touch and listening to music are used. Three studies with different measurements showed a difference of 34.7 mL in one pumping session to a difference of 151.2 mL over 14 days, which are clinically significant differences. Music therapy was also associated with measurable reduced stress levels and it may be that any form of relaxation aids the volume of milk obtained.</P>
<P>Higher volumes of milk were found in studies that involved massage of the breast before or with pumping, warming the breast before pumping, using appropriate breast shield sizes, initiation of pumping for a very low birthweight infant within one hour of birth rather than later, increased frequency of pumping (four or more times per day versus three or less times a day). Simultaneous compared to sequential pumping with an electric pump was examined in five studies and did not show differences in milk quantity, nor did two structured support programmes to assist women with milk expression for their very low birth weight infant in a neonatal unit. The vacuum patterns tested for a large electric pump may show a difference though the pattern of differences was unclear in the published material.</P>
<P>Sixteen studies, not all with data for analysis, examined milk volume that involved comparing various types and brands of pump or hand expression and found no pump consistently significantly increased the milk volume obtained. The studies tended to use different measures, set a maximum pumping time, measured output from one breast or two, and few compared the same pumps, which limited drawing conclusions. The time period over which expression or pumping occurs should be noted when comparing findings as the included studies measured from a single expression from one breast to 60 days (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Slusher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slusher 2007</LINK> reports a significant mean difference in total volume during a six-day period during the first two weeks after birth of 161 mL, 212 mL and 373 mL depending on the method. If these amounts were divided by six days and by the number of feeds per day, the differences between methods might not be clinically significant. Similarly, the difference of 2.10 cc reported by <LINK REF="STD-Flaherman-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Flaherman 2012</LINK>, whereas the 35 mL higher volume in a single expression when using a relaxation tape, if repeated in each expression, might be more clinically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Feher-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Feher 1989</LINK>), as would be the up to 500 mL higher amount on day 14 found with relaxation techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Keith-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Keith 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In four studies that used the same brand and model of a large electric pump (Medela Lactina) with double collection set compared to hand expression the results were inconsistent and with small sample sizes (n = 25 to 68). Though the total mean volume over six days within a two-week period was highest with an electric pump; on day one the mean volume was highest with hand expression (<LINK REF="STD-Slusher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slusher 2007</LINK>). The volume of milk on day one to day six indicated an overall greater quantity was likely with the pump (<LINK REF="STD-Lussier-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lussier 2015</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK> measured on day five, although in both, the strength of the difference varied over the days with the confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect on some days. Milk volume for one expression at 12 to 36 hours postpartum indicated little difference in quantity (<LINK REF="STD-Flaherman-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Flaherman 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials of small electric or manual pumps compared to each other or to large electric pumps or hand expression used different brands of pumps and different measures, and overall showed no difference, inconsistent or non-comparable results. Of particular note is that there was no evidence found in the trials available that expensive large electric pumps show a consistent increased quantity of milk obtained compared to small electric or manual pumps despite a widespread perception that large electric pumps are better than other methods.</P>
<P>Lack of clear results may relate to the wide individual variation between participants and the most effective method differs depending on the days since birth or across the stage of expression. <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK> reported on day five after birth a range of nought to 1405 mL (mean 149 to 373), depending on method; <LINK REF="STD-Slusher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slusher 2007</LINK> reported on day five (third day of pumping) a range from nought to 1095 mL (mean 190 to 368), depending on method.</P>
<P>Time taken to obtain milk was reported in some studies as an indicator of the effectiveness of the pump. One study of two small electric pumps and a large electric pump found a significant mean difference of two to six minutes per session between the pumps (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 2008</LINK>), which could accumulate to 12 to 36 minutes for a mother pumping six times per day, with another trial finding sequential pumping took 3.5 hours per week less than simultaneous pumping for the same volume of milk (<LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1995</LINK>), which is approximately 30 minutes per day difference, and may influence some mothers in their choice of pump. Two other studies comparing two pumps (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2013</LINK>) and four pumps (<LINK REF="STD-Bernabe_x002d_Garcia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bernabe-Garcia 2012</LINK>) found no significant time difference (none of the pumps were the same brand). Most studies instructed mothers to continue pumping until the milk flow slowed or ceased, however, a maximum duration was set in some studies, whereas other studies only reported the amount obtained at time points (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The frequency of pumping or expressing recommended in the included studies ranged from a minimum of three times per day to 12 times per day. However, the recommendation made may not have been the frequency achieved, which (where reported) ranged from approximate means of less than three to more than six expressions per day (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Time spent pumping may also indicate the motivation to continue pumping for the infant in the neonatal unit, and the time spent increased each week in the additional support group, whereas it decreased in the control group over the six weeks of the study.</P>
<P>Many mothers and clinicians are focused on milk volumes though there is some indication that "feeding the freezer" may affect the milk constituents as well as the mother's time and own body reserves. Hand expression or a large electric pump may provide higher protein than a manual pump. Increasing the volume though hand expression combined with pumping ('Hands-on Pumping') was briefly reported in a conference abstract as showing a significant decrease in milk protein content as the volume increased, which could have clinical implications if further evidence supports this finding (<LINK REF="STD-Stellwagen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stellwagen 2010</LINK>). Hyponatremia can be a concern in preterm infants receiving human milk, and findings from one study indicate a 19.35% to 22.65% (P = 0.002) higher sodium content in hand-expressed milk compared to manual or electric pump use (<LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>), a similar finding to a previous cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1994</LINK>). Differences were also found in the potassium content, which was lower in hand-expressed milk reflecting the higher sodium level (<LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fat content was higher with breast massage when pumping, the difference was found to be variable with the relaxation methods trials, and mothers who received an additional support programme showed no difference in lipid levels in their milk compared to the standard care group. In relation to pumps tested, fat levels were found to be higher at the end of 10 minutes' pumping in one of the two small electric pumps compared but no difference in another study comparing a large electric pump with hand expression.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference found in energy content (kcal/L) between milk obtained by four methods and no difference in carbohydrate level comparing a large electric pump versus hand expression.</P>
<P>The mean serum prolactin change was found to be no different for simultaneous versus sequential pumping of milk in one study and data were not available for analysis related to prolactin response in two other studies, or effect on oxytocin release with pump type or method.</P>
<P>No significant difference was found in oxytocin response between pumps tested in three studies or in two cross-over studies between simultaneous and sequential pumping or between variations in breast shield size with both reported as group differences and not as pair analysis. In a cross-over study, more mothers experienced milk leaking (oxytocin release) with Theraputic Touch.</P>
<P>No study reported data on economic outcomes in a way that could be analysed in this review.</P>
<P>Breastfeeding and the provision of human milk for human babies is a biologically normal activity and thus is different from many activities investigated by randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In trials comparing interventions, it is important to include, or at least refer to, the outcomes in the normal situation so as to avoid comparing only one abnormal situation with another abnormal situation, and implying that milk expression or pumping is normal and synonymous with breastfeeding.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:35:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We attempted to be as inclusive as possible in the search strategy and have included studies reported in languages other than English where translations could be obtained. Researchers known or likely to have studies related to milk expression were contacted by email as well as through their professional organisations and social media. Pump manufacturers were contacted seeking trials on their equipment, though none notified us of any trials.</P>
<P>Interpreting the findings of the studies included in the review was complex. The included studies were published between 1982 and 2015 and equipment, practices and attitudes change over time. It must be noted that within the categories of pump type, such as manual or electric, not all the pumps were the same brand or worked in a similar way. A different pump, though within the same category, might have different outcomes, or the same brand may have changed over the years. The procedure in which the method was used may have varied between studies as there were inconsistent results for the one analysis in which the same make of pump was used in three different settings. Three studies included breast massage or hand expression with pumping as a stated aspect of their trial, whereas another taught all mothers to massage their breasts as a routine part of milk expression, independent of which pump or hand-expression group to which they were allocated. Measures used in trials varied greatly which limited comparisons.</P>
<P>The small sample sizes (n = 9 to 280) and very wide standard deviations mean the findings may not be applicable to other women or other settings. The majority of the participants were mothers of infants in neonatal units (n = 1547 women, 26 trials) plus healthy infants at home (n = 730 women, 14 trials) and a mix (n = 16, one trial). Some findings such as sodium levels are particularly relevant to preterm infants, though may be of limited relevance to mothers of healthy full-term infants. Findings related to expensive large electric pumps may be of limited use in a resource-poor setting, whereas the techniques of massage, relaxation, timing, and warmth are all low-resource, low-technology interventions that should generally be available worldwide, though training is required for the specific technique of Therapeutic Touch. Not all results have clinical significance though may be very relevant to a researcher or an equipment manufacturer. Each situation needs to consider this review with regard to its specific situation.</P>
<P>Some studies reported on duration of breastfeeding related to the method used. Duration was not an outcome included in this review as there are many variables. Mothers may have different reasons for expressing or pumping milk, including expressing a small amount to assist the baby to attach to the breast, expressing if overfull and uncomfortable, short separations from a baby otherwise feeding at the breast or expressing larger quantities of milk long term for a baby who cannot feed at the breast. None of the studies addressed whether the mother's own needs for milk expression were met.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:36:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review now includes 41 trials involving 2293 women that took place in 14 countries under a variety of circumstances and published from 1982 to 2015. Twenty-five studies were parallel design and 16 studies were cross-over designs or include an aspect of the trial with a cross-over design. Twenty-two of the studies involving 1339 women provided data that could be analysed in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> contributing to both of the primary outcomes and five of the six secondary outcomes. We were unable to pool findings from studies for most review outcomes due to heterogeneity in interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported (in particular reporting outcomes at widely varying time points). For this reason, most of the results were derived from single studies with findings that have not been replicated elsewhere. We have therefore not produced a 'Summary of findings' table for this update. This will be re-examined in future updates.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed. We assessed each of the included studies for the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence. Overall, the main concerns noted were the lack of information concerning the blinding of the assessors (objectivity in the management and assessment of the data), how incomplete data were addressed (biasing the measure of effectiveness) and if the studies were free of other potential biases. It would not be possible to blind participants and personnel for most of the interventions as these involved comparing hand expression to a pump, or comparing two or more different types of pumps, or techniques such as breast massage.</P>
<P>Examining methods of milk expression has many challenges, and some could be addressed through greater attention to study design details. Where cross-over designs were used, results were not always reported as paired data that would take into account individual variations, or examining the order of use of each method, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the results.</P>
<P>Unintentional additions or omissions to the care of the participants may have effects on the outcomes, such as providing a bra to assist hands-free pumping to some of the participants in one trial, or fewer staff available to carry out the intervention than needed. In the absence of a validated tool for the assessment of maternal satisfaction, various authors have devised their own rather disparate methods of assessment. Times at which milk volumes and constituents were measured varied greatly. The lack of consistency in the way outcome data were measured and reported should be kept in mind when interpreting results.</P>
<P>Many trialists were willing to discuss their work and provide clarification or further data, however some gaps remained.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:36:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We acknowledge that there was the potential for bias at all stages in the reviewing process. In order to reduce publication and language bias, we made requests widely through lactation networks and through equipment manufacturers, seeking any additional studies to those found by literature searching that yielded some contacts with researchers and additional studies. We obtained translations of possible studies; however, the non-English language work may be under-represented though requests were made to all world regions. The amount of research related to milk expression appears to have increased in recent years, with hand expression being included more as well as research on techniques. Additional data were willingly provided and discussed by some trialists; we were unable to find some trialists; and some trialists did not reply to queries, which resulted in some data not being used as they were not available in a format suitable for analysis. Three authors from differing areas of expertise worked on all aspects of this review which encouraged discussion, a broader viewpoint and provided a step towards minimising bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-23 22:09:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>There are few (if any) other systematic reviews of methods of milk expression. Published descriptive reviews may favour healthcare systems and practices where large electric pumps are widely available and considered the norm. This affects the choice of research outcomes where high volume in the shortest time is considered the ideal outcome with some of the research funded by manufacturers to develop or test their equipment. Our analysis of the data from one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Boo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boo 2001</LINK>) differed markedly from the conclusions of the trialists; however, their conclusion has been frequently referred to in other material stating that milk expressed by pump was at higher likelihood of contamination, for which we found no evidence in two studies reviewed. The differences in sodium level found in the included data of <LINK REF="STD-Pessoto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pessoto 2010</LINK> was also found in the cross-over study with mothers of preterm infants by <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1994</LINK> who discusses the possible underlying physical and physiological differences between extraction by compression and by suction as well as mammary cell permeability at various stages of lactation.</P>
<P>Evidence examined in this update does not substantially change the conclusions of the original 2008 version of this review or the 2011 and 2015 updates, though this update provides some additional conclusions related to the positive effect of basic techniques such as relaxation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-09-27 15:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Genevieve Becker">
<P>A baby feeding at the breast is the biological norm. Expression of milk is a complex intervention of a very individual nature. Results from individual trials may not be generalisable to other cultures and situations. The results of this updated review suggest that the most suitable method of milk expression may depend on the time since birth, the purpose of expression and the individual mother. Hand expression may be more suitable in the first few days to initiate milk supply, and particularly where the constituents of the milk may be important. A large electric pump may be useful if quantity is the main goal, though pumping may have a higher risk of injury for the mother than hand expression. Findings of our review indicate there are low-cost techniques available to all mothers that may increase milk volume obtained. If a large electric pump is too costly, manual pumps may be as effective as regards volume obtained once milk supply is established. Hand expression or breast massage combined with pumping may be beneficial. The finding of significantly higher sodium content in hand-expressed milk indicates a need to take into account the method of obtaining milk when determining if there is a need for sodium supplementation of the preterm infant. Sodium concentration relates to milk volume, and aiming for high volumes with mechanical pumping may result in lower quality of some nutrients.</P>
<P>Results of this review highlight the importance of considering more than the method or the type of pump in isolation, and looking further to include initiation of expressing soon after birth if the infant is not able to breastfeed and assisting mothers to gain knowledge and skills to express their milk. Practitioners should consider using some means to help women consciously relax to increase the volume of milk obtained when pumping, as four studies showed a significant increase. From the information available in the included studies, important aspects that positively influenced mothers' satisfaction in their use of pumps included ease of assembly, ease of use and comfort. An understanding of individuals' preferences regarding activities during pump usage is required when choosing between simultaneous versus sequential breast pumping, as is the mother's subjective views on these techniques. We found no evidence that a particular type of pump was associated with a higher level of milk contamination, infant sepsis or transfer to feeding at the breast. Methodological shortcomings of some trials, especially small sample sizes and very large standard deviations, the small number of studies reviewed for each outcome, and the diversity in the nature, duration and frequency of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific equipment tested in the specific settings. Publications on methods and types of pumps should not be taken to mean that pumping milk is a normal part of breastfeeding; it is an intervention that should be justified before being recommended to an individual mother by a practitioner.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-19 14:36:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Findings from this review suggest that future research comparing methods of milk expression and pumping examine the reasons why women express milk and the contexts in which they do so, as well as the techniques, regimens and equipment used, which may require different study designs.</P>
<P>Common measurement points such as days two, seven, day 21, and day 42 would aid in comparisons of outcomes, as would as would consideration of co-interventions such as staff knowledge and support, staffing levels and maternal education, as well as mother's access to her baby, rest, food and fluids. Trials should include economic analyses of the relative costs and benefits of a milk expression method. It would be enlightening to include information on the life cycle environment cost of equipment related to different methods of milk expression and pumping.</P>
<P>Well-designed and well-reported studies are needed. Cross-over studies have the potential to examine how an individual mother responds to two or more methods of milk expression. Much of the data from of the cross-over studies could not be used in the analysis as they were not reported as between-mother difference or pair analysis, thus negating the value in using a cross-over design. This problem occurred both in small studies carried out by an individual in their own setting and in funded studies carried out by researchers in academic units.</P>
<P>Sixteen of the 30 studies that evaluated pumps or products reported support from the manufacturers. Independently funded research is needed, particularly to include methods such as hand expression and relaxation that do not have a commercial potential. There is a lack of data relating to how various methods and techniques of milk expression or pumping assist mothers to meet their own goals for milk expression, rather than goals set by the researchers. Research on mothers' views of effective methods is needed.</P>
<P>Some other apparent gaps in the research evidence are investigating back massage as a means of relaxation and stimulating oxytocin release and the "hot jar" technique of milk expression, as these method are widely suggested in health worker training materials particularly in lower-income countries; drinking a warm beverage, eating, watching TV (and if humorous or distressing programmes) or other activities while expressing or pumping, which all have the potential to affect maternal physiological responses. It was surprising that no research was found on the constituents of milk related to their immunological effects in relation to methods of expression.</P>

<P>The methods section was updated in 2011 to reflect changes in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), including changes to the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
<P>In the protocol and review versions 2008 and 2011, we considered possible period effects in cross-over trials whereby a systematic difference can arise between the two periods of the trial, such as natural variations in the first few weeks after birth. The possibility of such a period effect was the rationale behind the selection criterion that any included cross-over study must have the cross-over commencing at least 28 days after birth. This criterion resulted in the possible exclusion of many trials involving preterm infants, the group most at risk from lack of mother's milk. Thus, the 2015 update (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2015</LINK>) included cross-over studies commencing within the first 28 days after birth, which would be then evaluated for any period effect.</P>
<P>In this 2016 review, we have switched the intervention and control groups around in some analyses. We wanted to ensure that the less technological intervention when two pumps were compared, was the intervention and appeared on the left in the analysis tables and comparisons.</P>

<P>Compare: &#8220;The Medela Symphony pump (pump S; Medela AG, Baar, Switzerland) has an initial &#8220;let-down&#8221; mode with rapid low suction (120/minute, vacuum -50 to -200 mmHg), followed by &#8220;expression mode&#8221; (45-78/minute, vacuum -50 to -250 mmHg) with slower rate and deeper suction. The duration of the letdown mode can be altered by the mother and the vacuum strength altered at any time. The Philips AVENT Twin electronic breast pump (pump A; Philips Consumer Lifestyle, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) incorporates a petal massage cushion in the breast shield, designed to massage the areola and surrounding breast during pumping, in an electronic pump that offers flexibility of rate and suction (vacuum range, 0 to -250 mmHg), with the rate/suction strength control button positioned on the breast shield to allow greater ease of control.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Following randomization, mothers were given verbal and written information (Appendix 1 and 2, available online) and help with expressing breast milk by the staff of the NICU or postnatal ward with additional help from the research nurses, who had specific experience in advising on breastfeeding in the NICU setting and who also provided specific instruction on the optimal use of the assigned breast pump. At 1 hospital, manual expression was used during the first 48 hours before introducing a breast pump, while at the other site, mothers started using a breast pump immediately after delivery. Pump S was the standard pump in both NICUs and was therefore used prior to study entry. Breast pumps were located in a designated room in the NICUs but pumps could also be used at the infant&#8217;s bedside and were available for home use if a mother was discharged home. After the initial 10-day study period, mothers were encouraged to continue expressing milk using their allocated pump until their infant was discharged.&#8221;</P>
<P>Mothers recorded volume, time, etc, in a diary.</P>
<P>On day 10, mothers completed a maternal perception questionnaire using expanded Fewtrell scale to include "flexibility regarding the rate and amount of suction, location of control button, (and) speed of milk flow".</P>
<P>&#8220;Between days 3 and 10 (ideally days 5-7) postpartum, each mother was asked to express milk for a single fixed 15-minute period using her assigned breast pump&#8230;. to determine the total weight of milk, the time to the first appearance of milk, and the time taken to produce specific milk weights.&#8221;</P>

<P>Secondary outcome measures were total number of pumping sessions and total time spent expressing milk in the study period; mother&#8217;s opinion of the assigned pump; total volume of maternal breast milk expressed and consumed by the infant while in the NICU; number of days taken for the infant to achieve full enteral feeds (150 mL/kg/day); and whether or not the mother was breastfeeding her infant(s) at discharge.&#8221;</P>

<P>Further information was provided by the author. Regarding intervention integrity, among the full protocol group, 34 were assigned, 3 dropped out before received pump (2 standard, 1 novel). Of the 31 remaining, blood sampling carried out on 30 and of these paired oxytocin samples were available on 24 women. In the truncated protocol, 35 assigned, 3 dropped out before providing data (2 standard and 1 novel), leaving 32 participants. Overall, of the 62 participants referred to by the trialists, 59 were available for the volume tests, 58 for the fat content and up to 58 reported on maternal satisfaction.</P>
<P>Use of a special elastic bra: from email from author on 7/1/11 "The first 11 mothers in the study were given the hands-free pumping bra by the nursing staff at the beginning of the study to facilitate pumping....[It] apparently did bias the results because it was much easier to insert the standard pump flange into the bra and more difficult to insert the novel flange".</P>
<P>Other outcomes described included: time to express; maternal compliance with recommended frequency of use in the home setting; duration of breastfeeding following return to the workforce at 6/12 postpartum and milk extraction efficiency/degree of breast emptying.</P>

<P>Canada. &#8220;The setting for the study was a 33-bed, tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a teaching hospital that is the referral center for a geographically defined region in central-west Ontario, delivering approximately 29 000 infants per year. Inclusion criteria were: infants with birth weights less than 1500 g (VLBW), who were inborn or transferred with their mother within 72 hours of birth if they were out-born, and fed mother's milk by parental choice.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were: multiple births; infants with severe congenital, surgical, or chromosomal abnormalities; and non&#8211;English-speaking parents. Fathers, as well as mothers, were included"</P>
<P>&#8220;The sample size for the total project was determined a priori and was based on the primary objective of the intervention study. The sample size was based on the difference between the success rate of breastfeeding at 3 months corrected age in the study setting, which was about 10%, and the desired success rate defined for the intervention study, which was 30%. The sample size for the intervention study was 58 infants per group based on a 1-tailed test, an alpha of 0.05, and a beta of 0.2.&#8221; (Pinelli 2003)</P>

<P>&#8220;structured breastfeeding counselling program (SSBC) for parents of preterm infants, compared with conventional hospital-based breastfeeding support (CHBS)&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The SSBC consisted of (1) viewing a video on breastfeeding preterm infants; (2) individual counselling by the research lactation consultant, who was not a member of the hospital staff; (3) weekly personal in-hospital contact; and (4) frequent post discharge contact through the infant's first year or until breastfeeding was discontinued. The CHBS group had standard support confined to the period of hospitalization in the NICU, which included contact with the regular hospital staff (i.e. nurses, nutritionists, neonatal nurse practitioners, physicians). No specialized breastfeeding clinic was available to parents in the hospital at the time of the study, and only a limited number of staff had any formal education in lactation or breastfeeding support.&#8221;</P>

<P>"Mothers will be recruited when their infants are around a month old, they will be randomised either to use one of two state of the art modern single electric breast pumps or to act as controls with no breast pump (but will receive a baby care voucher of similar value). If allocated to a breast pump, mothers will be asked to take part in a physiological study when their babies are 6 weeks old. In this test the mothers will be asked to express breast milk for 10 minutes on each breast. The primary hypothesis is that the total weight of milk produced in a 20 minute period and the weight of milk produced at 1 minute intervals at age 6 weeks will be greater for mothers using 1 of the pumps. A small sample of breast milk (~5ml) will be collected for analysis, the remaining expressed milk will returned to the mother.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Each month between the age of 3 and 6 months, all the mothers will be asked to complete online questionnaires about their breast-feeding and the use of their breast pumps (if they have one). At the end of the 6 months the mothers will be given a small voucher for a child-care store as a way of saying 'thank-you' for the inconvenience caused."</P>

<P>No sample size calculation described. Participants were asked to exclusively use the assigned method of expression for the first 7 days postpartum, after which they could use either or both methods for the remaining 21 days of the trial. 18 of the 20 hand expression group changed to using an EP. Data used in this review have been confined to the results from the parallel period of the trial which was for the first 7 postpartum days. In the published paper, data analysis was reported by the original assigned groups and presented as cumulative volumes which had the effect of enhancing any early differences and blurring later differences. Although difficult to match with the published data, the non-cumulative data for the first 7 days as provided by the trialist in personal communication was used in this review.</P>

<P>Significant difference was found between at least of the 4 pumps tested in this cross-over study and reported in a table in the published paper with median rating and range. Parameters of ease of use, comfort, pleasing to use, and overall opinion, (P &lt; 0.001) and amount of suction (P = 0.007). Paper states :"Isis generally received better scores on the items easy to use, comfort, and overall opinion, followed by Harmony and Little Heart, which were equally accepted, and then by Evenflo. Scores for perceived amount of suction and pleasing to use were both more favourable for Isis, Harmony, and Little Heart than for Evenflo."</P>

<P>Mean rankings were reported in the paper. Standard pump was better for ease of assembly (P = 0.04) and in expectation of nipple irritation if continued to use (P = 0.034). No differences reported in nipple irritation between the pumps or for overall pump preference. Among the 61 mothers who selected a pump to keep for their own use, there was no overall pump preference reported. However, among the 51 mothers who had not been inadvertently issued with a special elastic bra, which permitted hands-free pumping and happened to fit the standard pump better, there was a preference for the novel pump (P = 0.05).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>2008: Genevieve Becker (GB) and Mary Renfrew (MJR) independently read articles identified by the initial searches to determine inclusion or exclusion. GB and Felicia McCormick (FM) independently read articles identified by secondary searches. Two authors (GB, FM) used the data extraction forms independently and then jointly reviewed findings. GB entered the data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) and FM checked it.</P>
<P>2011: Genevieve Becker (GB), Fionnuala Cooney (FC), and Hazel Ann Smith (HAS) independently read articles identified by the initial searches and secondary searches to determine inclusion or exclusion, used the data extraction forms independently and then jointly reviewed findings. Data were entered by each author into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and then jointly checked and reviewed findings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>2008: We assessed the method of allocation concealment used in each included study using criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Quality scores for allocation concealment were assigned to each trial, where A = adequate, B = unclear, C = clearly inadequate. We did not require a minimum quality score for inclusion. We carried out statistical analysis using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>.</P>
