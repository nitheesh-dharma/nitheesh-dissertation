<TITLE>Low level laser therapy for low-back pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-27 10:29:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixty to eighty per cent of people suffer from back pain at some time in their lives. Of those who develop acute low-back pain (LBP), up to 30% will go on to develop chronic LBP. The toll on individuals, families and society makes the successful management of this common, but benign condition an important goal.</P>
<P>Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is used by some physiotherapists to treat LBP. LLLT is a non-invasive light source treatment that generates a single wavelength of light. It emits no heat, sound, or vibration. It is also called photobiology or biostimulation. LLLT is believed to affect the function of connective tissue cells (fibroblasts), accelerate connective tissue repair and act as an anti-inflammatory agent. Lasers with different wavelengths, varying from 632 to 904 nm, are used in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.</P>
<P>We included seven small studies with a total of 384 people with non-specific LBP of varying durations. Three studies (168 people) separately showed that LLLT was more effective at reducing pain in the short-term (less than three months), and intermediate-term (six months) than sham (fake) laser. However, the strength and number of treatments were varied and the amount of the pain reduction was small. Three studies (102 people) separately reported that LLLT with exercise was not better than exercise alone or exercise plus sham in short-term pain reduction.</P>
<P>One study (56 people) showed that LLLT was more effective than sham at reducing disability in the short term. Three studies (102 people) compared LLLT plus exercise with exercise plus sham or exercise alone and did not show significant reduction in disability. Two studies (90 people) separately reported that LLLT was not more effective at reducing disability than exercise alone or exercise plus sham in the short-term.</P>
<P>Based on these small trials, with different populations, LLLT doses and comparison groups, there are insufficient data to either support or refute the effectiveness of LLLT for the treatment of LBP. We were unable to determine optimal dose, application techniques or length of treatment with the available evidence. Larger trials that look specifically at these questions are required.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain (LBP) is a major health problem and a major cause of medical expenses and disablement. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) can be used to treat musculoskeletal disorders such as back pain.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of LLLT in patients with non-specific LBP.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED and PEDro from their start to November 2007 with no language restrictions. We screened references in the included studies and in reviews and conducted citation tracking of identified RCTs and reviews using Science Citation Index. We also contacted content experts.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigating LLLT to treat non-specific low-back pain were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed methodological quality using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group and extracted data. Studies were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed according to Cochrane Back Review Group guideline.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven heterogeneous English language RCTs with reasonable quality were included. </P>
<P>Three small studies (168 people) separately showed statistically significant but clinically unimportant pain relief for LLLT versus sham therapy for sub-acute and chronic low-back pain at short-term and intermediate-term follow-up (up to six months). One study (56 people) showed that LLLT was more effective than sham at reducing disability in the short term. Three studies (102 people) reported that LLLT plus exercise were not better than exercise, with or without sham in the short-term in reducing pain or disability. Two studies (90 people) reported that LLLT was not more effective than exercise, with or without sham in reducing pain or disability in the short term. </P>
<P>Two small trials (151 people) independently found that the relapse rate in the LLLT group was significantly lower than in the control group at the six-month follow-up. </P>
<P>No side effects were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Based on the heterogeneity of the populations, interventions and comparison groups, we conclude that there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions on the clinical effect of LLLT for low-back pain. </P>
<P>There is a need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs to evaluate the effects of LLLT compared to other treatments, different lengths of treatment, wavelengths and dosages. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain (LBP) and related disabilities are major public health problems and major causes of medical expenses, absenteeism and disablement (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1995</LINK>). Sixty to eighty per cent of people suffer from back pain at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2004</LINK>). Of all adults complaining of back pain, only about five per cent can be classified as having nerve root pain (using strict diagnostic criteria), with the remainder having back pain with or without referred leg pain, which is commonly referred to as non-specific low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2004</LINK>). Of those who develop acute LBP, up to 30% will go on to develop chronic LBP. The past 15 years have seen an intensive research effort to identify effective treatments and management strategies for low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Nachemson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachemson 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Acute non-specific LBP is a benign and self-limiting condition. Once serious pathology (red flags) has been ruled out, current guidelines for the management of acute back pain recommend pain management interventions plus reassurance and advice to stay active as the interventions of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 2004</LINK>). The aim of conservative (non-surgical) treatments for LBP is usually to relieve pain and associated disability. Recommended treatment options are diverse but there is sound evidence for only a minority of these therapies (<LINK REF="REF-CRD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nachemson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachemson 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is currently used by some physiotherapists as a therapeutic intervention for musculoskeletal disorders such as back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Beckerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckerman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK>). Low level laser therapy is a light source treatment that generates light of a single wavelength. It emits no heat, sound, or vibration. Instead of producing a thermal effect, LLLT may act by non-thermal or photochemical reactions in cells. It is also referred to as photobiology or biostimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Basford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baxter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 1991</LINK>). Low level laser therapy is thought to affect fibroblast function and accelerate connective tissue repair (<LINK REF="REF-Kreisler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreisler 2002</LINK>). It has also been reported that LLLT has anti-inflammatory effects due to its action in reducing prostaglandin synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Sakurai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakurai 2000</LINK>). Most LLLT lasers are Class 3a or Class 3b (<LINK REF="REF-Baxter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 1991</LINK>). Class 3a LLLTs have a power output of less than 5 mW, and Class 3b LLLTs have an output of less than 500 mW. Low level laser therapy lasers can be either visible or invisible.</P>
<P>Some studies suggest that LLLT has a beneficial anti-inflammatory and pain attenuation effect in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Ceccherelli-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceccherelli 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizokami-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizokami 1993</LINK>). A possible mechanism of the effects of LLLT on pain relief is its anti-inflammatory and connective tissue repair process which have been shown in some in vitro and in vivo studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sakurai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakurai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sattayut-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sattayut 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skinner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 1996</LINK>). Research in humans on wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects of LLLT showed conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Baxter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 1991</LINK>). The effectiveness of laser therapy in painful disorders is still unclear and needs to be examined more rigorously (<LINK REF="REF-Beckerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckerman 1992</LINK>).</P>

<P>Trials that included male or female subjects aged 18 years and over, with acute (pain for four weeks or less), subacute (pain for one to three months) or chronic low-back pain (pain for longer than three months) were included (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). Low-back pain was defined as pain localised between the shoulder blades and the folds of the buttocks, with or without radiation to the legs (<LINK REF="REF-CRD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trials that included subjects with low-back pain caused by specific pathological entities such as infection, metastatic diseases, neoplasms, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fracture, inflammatory processes or radicular syndrome were excluded. </P>
<P>Trials that discussed musculoskeletal disorders were included if a separate analysis was reported for low-back pain.</P>

<P>All the citations identified by the above searches were downloaded into a reference manager database. Two authors (ES and RYN), non-blinded to authors and publication journals, independently screened for inclusion, using the pre-specified criteria. If it was clear from the abstract that the study did not meet the selection criteria, it was excluded. If it was unclear from the abstract whether the study met the selection criteria, the full paper was retrieved. Two authors (MAK and SAMH), using the same selection criteria used for the abstract screening, read the full paper and made final selection decisions. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, followed, if necessary, by a third reviewer (RYN) if disagreement persisted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of Methodological Quality:</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (MAK and SI) independently assessed the methodological quality of each RCT. Disagreements were dealt with by discussion and consensus in review team (ES, AR and RYN).</P>
<P>The 11 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). Each criterion was scored as "yes"," no" or "unclear", depending on how successfully the criterion was met. The criteria for evaluating the internal validity and their operationalization are found in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>If the study provided "unclear" information on methodological criteria, the authors were contacted for additional information. If no response was obtained from authors or if the information was no longer available, these criteria remained 'unclear'.</P>
<P>We had planned a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the overall results were the same when studies above different methodological cut-off points were synthesized (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>), but were unable to because of lack of studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction:</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (MAK and SI) independently extracted the data on study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Data extraction was not blinded to authors and journal of publication. Data were extracted and entered into Review Manager 4.2 for the calculation of summary statistics. Disagreements on the results of data extraction were resolved by consensus. If disagreement persisted, a third reviewer (RYN) was consulted.</P>
<P>Laser characteristics and dosages were recalculated based on the data available in the articles or from personal contacts. The World Association of Laser Therapy (WALT) acknowledges that incomplete dosage reporting is a major problem, and recommends that review authors recalculate laser dosages of primary studies (<LINK REF="REF-WALT-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WALT 2004</LINK>). We calculated power, density (mW/cm2) and dose (J) for each study. Power density for pulse lasers (mW/cm2) was calculated by multiplying the peak power pulse by the pulse duration and then by the pulse frequency and dividing the total by the spot size on the skin. Power density for lasers with continuous output (mW/cm2) was calculated by dividing the mean power by the spot size on the skin. Dose (J) was calculated by multiplying the mean power by the treatment time per session. Authors were contacted to provide sufficient information for recalculation. Based on the recommended anti-inflammatory dosage for low level laser therapy developed by the WALT (<LINK REF="REF-WALT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WALT 2005</LINK>), the minimum dose for irradiating 904 nm lasers to the lumbar spine is 4 J/point. Recommended doses are based on ultrasonographic measurements of depths from skin surface and typical volume of pathological tissue and estimated optical penetration for the different laser types in Caucasians. According to these recommendations, included articles were divided into adequate and inadequate dosing subgroups (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis:</HEADING>
<P>The statistical analysis followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-CC-Handbook-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CC Handbook 2005</LINK>) and the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcome measures for each RCT were shown as point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Potential sources of clinical heterogeneity were identified. For studies judged as clinically homogeneous, statistical heterogeneity was tested with the Q test (chi-square) and I2. If data were statistically heterogeneous (P &lt; 0.1), reasons for heterogeneity were explored. Regardless of any evidence of statistical heterogeneity, the influence of specific differences between the RCTs was investigated.</P>
<P>Where standard deviation was not reported, we calculated it using reported values of confidence intervals. Meta-analysis was carried out for LLLT plus exercise versus sham plus exercise comparisons.</P>
<P>Because disability and range of motion were measured with similar but not identical instruments, SMD instead of WMD were calculated for pooling the results where possible.</P>
<P>We selected a 20-mm change in pain on a 100-point pain scale, or 30% as the minimum clinically significant difference (MCID) for pain scores, based on <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>, who suggests an absolute difference of two points on 0 to 10 numeric scale and other studies that suggest that the minimum clinically significant change is not an absolute number but a range that depends on the baseline values and duration of pain (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Roer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Roer 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>To create a pooled effect measure, the team examined possible sources of clinical heterogeneity by considering:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>methodological study quality;</LI>
<LI>population differences in age, gender;</LI>
<LI>duration of symptoms (i.e. acute versus chronic);</LI>
<LI>low-back pain aetiology;</LI>

<LI>outcomes (i.e. subject reports of pain and pain relief, range of motion, other measures of performance (i.e. activities of daily living, disability, function), or employment status).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We had planned different sub-group analyses for pain categories (acute, sub-acute or chronic low-back pain), different follow-up durations (short-term - less than three months after randomisation, intermediate-term - between three months and one year, or long-term - longer than one year), and adequacy of laser dosing (adequate and inadequate according to power density and irradiated energy). The sub-group analyses for follow-up durations and laser dosing were only carried out for LLLT plus exercise versus sham plus exercise comparisons. Because of an insufficient number of studies, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression and publication bias tests were not carried out.</P>
<P>When the data could not be entered in the meta-analysis because of clinical heterogeneity, lack of data, or the way the authors of the trials reported the results (for example: no information about standard deviation of the means), we performed a qualitative analysis by attributing levels of evidence to the effectiveness of low level laser therapy, taking into account the methodological quality and the outcome of the original studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>):</P>

<P>In total, we found seven small trials (384 people) that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The populations included in the trials had a diagnosis of non-specific LBP, but differed with respect to duration of pain, previous treatments and distributions of age. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>) was limited to patients with acute pain but the duration was not clear in the report and some patients might have suffered from an acute exacerbation of chronic low-back pain. Another trial included patients with LBP of at least one-month duration (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>), but the mean duration of pain in the laser and control groups was seven and 13 months respectively. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>), patients with LBP of at least three months duration were included. Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) were limited to patients with chronic pain (more than one year). <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK> had no limitations on the duration of pain. The lumbar pain group (41 patients) in this study consisted of lumbago (23), ischiatic neuralgia (9), lumbar musculofascial pain (2), herniated disc (3), lumbar spondylosis (4).</P>
<P>The types of laser, dose, duration and frequency of treatments varied among the studies. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) used infrared diode lasers. Only one study used a 1060 nm Nd-Yag laser (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>). Irradiation energy densities were recalculated based on the information provided in the reports and if possible, directly from authors. Laser doses ranged from 0.1 J (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) to 29.9 J (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>). Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) used sufficient laser dosage according to <LINK REF="REF-WALT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WALT 2005</LINK> recommendations (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK> used a Nd-Yag laser with some thermal effects. This study was included because the laser dose was sufficient based on WALT recommendations and the laser was considered low level laser by the authors. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>) had three arms comparing LLLT, LLLT plus exercise and sham plus exercise. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>) had three arms comparing LLLT, LLLT plus exercise and exercise alone. All other studies included a sham (switched off laser) group.</P>
<P>In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>), treatment duration was less than two weeks; in others (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) it was about four weeks or more. The number of treatment sessions differed from one session in <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK> to 20 sessions in <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>. All studies irradiated painful areas, except <LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>, in which the laser targets were painful areas and trigger points. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>), exercise therapy was used in both the laser and control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK> included three groups: exercise plus laser, laser alone and exercise alone. The exercise programs in these studies were considered to be comparable.</P>
<P>With respect to the outcome measures, pain intensity was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK> measured pain with a VAS but reported the results as the percentage of pain relief. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) pain was graded as exacerbation, little or no change, fair, good, and excellent. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) assessed disability using validated questionnaires and lumbar range of motion. Pain relapse rate was measured in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>). Only one study reported self-rated overall improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>). The timing of outcome measures varied from "immediately after the end of sessions" to one year after randomisation.</P>

<P>The results of the methodological quality assessment are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. All studies were described as randomised; however the method of randomisation was explicit in only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>) used a block randomisation method for patient allocation. We remained unsure about the effectiveness of the randomisation in the <LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK> study because there was a big difference in the duration of pain between the two groups (seven months in the laser group and 13 months in the control group). Allocation to treatment groups was concealed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>). Patients and care providers were blinded in all studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>). Outcome assessors were blinded in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>). The drop-out rate and loss to follow-up in the data analysed were less than 20% in all studies but one (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>), where 21% were excluded from final analysis in the control arm, while there were only 11% excluded from the experimental group. Three studies conducted an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK> had a very short (one day) follow-up and the sum of crude frequencies in the tables were the same as the total number of randomised patients, but we were not sure about the intention-to-treat analysis in this study. For more details about the criteria met in each trial, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The number of criteria met in the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) ranged from six to 11, so all were considered high quality studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection:</HEADING>
<P>Our searches resulted in the identification of 28 reports in CENTRAL, 59 reports in MEDLINE, 107 in EMBASE, 35 in CINAHL, nine in AMED, and 577 in PEDro. After removing duplicates, 142 reports were screened in the next step. After exclusion of irrelevant trials, we obtained hard copies of 34 trials, including 25 English, three German, two Russian, two Polish, one Japanese and one Italian. Of these, 24 were primary studies, but only five trials met the inclusion criteria. Reasons for the exclusion of these studies are explained in the Characteristics of Excluded Studies table. We contacted the primary authors of trials and experts in the field of LLLT to obtain additional information that was not reported in the published studies. One expert informally discussed this review with some other experts in the field of LLLT. One article was found in this phase (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The updated search to January 2007 resulted in the identification of 14 reports in MEDLINE, 54 in EMBASE, seven in CINAHL and two in PEDro. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, four references were evaluated. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>) was included. One was excluded and two non-English studies are awaiting assessment, pending the receipt of additional information from the author and will be addressed in a future update of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. LLLT versus sham treatment</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain:</HEADING>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>) measured pain in LLLT and sham groups using VAS (56 people). The patients in this study had chronic low-back pain and the results were reported for short-term follow-up period (one month). This study used adequate laser dosing. <LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK> showed a significant decrease in pain measured on a 100-point VAS with a mean difference of -16 (95% CI: -27.95 to -4.05).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>) used adequate laser dosing in elderly patients over 60 years of age. They measured pain with a VAS but reported the results as the percentage of pain relief graded as poor, regular, good and excellent (71 people). In this study, at the six-month follow-up, 44.7% of the patients in the LLLT group and 15.2% of the control group reported excellent relief (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) with adequate laser dosing, pain was graded as exacerbation, little or no change, fair, good, and excellent (41 people). The sum of the frequencies of patients with 'excellent', 'good' and 'fair' grades was defined as 'effective treatment' frequency. One day after treatment, the percentage of 'effective treatment' was 94% (15/16) in the laser group and 48% (12/25) in the sham group (P = 0.007).</P>
<P>In summary, three high quality studies (168 people) separately showed statistically significant pain relief with LLLT in short-term and intermediate-term follow-up compared with sham treatment. All of them used adequate dosing as defined by <LINK REF="REF-WALT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WALT 2005</LINK>. Because of the differences in population and pain relief scales, meta-analysis was not possible. There is strong evidence that LLLT provides better pain relief compared with sham treatment, however the effect is not clinically significant. Because of the small trials, clinical heterogeneity, and the unconventional use of outcome measures, future large high quality trials are needed to confirm these findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low back pain related disability:</HEADING>
<P>Pain-related disability was measured using the Oswestry questionnaire in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>), which showed a significant improvement in disability at one-month follow-up with a mean difference of -8.2 (95% CI: -13.44 to -2.96).</P>
<P>Based on one high quality trial (56 people), there is moderate evidence that LLLT reduced disability more than sham treatment in individuals with (sub)acute or chronic LBP, when compared to a sham treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Relapse rate:</HEADING>
<P>The percentage of relapse was reported in two trials (151 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>), the relapse rates were reported after one month, six months and one year after the beginning of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK> reported the relapse rate at the six-month follow-up. Both trials reported that LLLT is statistically significantly more effective than sham for reducing relapse rate at six months, in patients with (sub)acute or chronic low-back pain without neurological symptoms. However, the two trials differed in population and were therefore not statistically pooled. <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK> included a senior population with chronic LBP and <LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK> a working-aged population with acute LBP of undetermined duration. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK> used adequate laser dosage while <LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK> used inadequate dosage. The study with inadequate dosage reported the largest effect size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary Outcomes:</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>) measured range of motion in centimetres using the Schober test (<LINK REF="REF-Moll-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moll 1971</LINK>). Comparing lumbar range of motion in short-term follow-up, this study (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>) used adequate dosing, resulting in a mean difference of -0.2 (95% CI: -2.14 to 1.74).</P>
<P>Therefore, there is little or no difference in range of motion between individuals who received laser therapy and those who received sham therapy.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>) reported the perception of benefit, which was assessed using a visual analogue scale (lower values indicated less pain). At the one-month follow-up, there was little or no difference in perception of benefit between the laser and control groups (SMD: -9.5 (95% CI: -20.9 to 1.9).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>) measured the overall efficacy of treatment using a composite measure consisting three parts: The intensity of pain with the Ritchie scale (<LINK REF="REF-Ritchie-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritchie 1968</LINK>), deviation of vertebral column, and functional limitation (80 people). These clinical features completely disappeared or improved in 97.5% of patients in the LLLT group and 37.5% of the control group after one month.</P>
<P>In summary, there was moderate evidence of little or no difference between those who received LLLT and sham treatments for range of motion or perception of benefit, but moderate evidence that LLLT was better than sham treatment on overall improvement in patients suffering from low-back pain. Because of the small trials and the clinical heterogeneity, these findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects:</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) reported neither discomfort related to laser treatment nor an increase in pain in either group. In <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>, five patients in the LLLT group (two abandoned and three needed to use NSAIDS) and nine patients in the control group (three abandoned and six needed to use NSAIDS) were lost to follow-up.</P>

<P>Three studies compared LLLT plus exercise with sham plus exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) or exercise alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) used inadequate laser dosing and compared pain in those who received LLLT plus exercise with those who received sham plus exercise in patients with chronic low-back pain. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK> used a 7.5-cm VAS (results were transformed to a 100-point VAS to enable pooling of short-term results). <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK> compared pain at weeks six and 12 after randomisation. The pooled analysis (fixed-effects) of two very small trials (61 people) showed that there was no significant difference in pain relief between those who received LLLT plus exercise and those who received sham plus exercise in patients with chronic low-back pain without neurological symptoms in post-treatment (short-term) follow-up, with WMD of -6.38 (95%CI: -15.68 to 2.91). However, one small trial found that at the 12-week follow-up, after six weeks of no intervention, LLLT plus exercise (21 people) relieved pain better than sham plus exercise (20 people) (mean difference -19.0 (95% CI: -28.22 to -9.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gur 2003</LINK> compared LLLT + exercise with exercise alone in short-term follow-up. The sham laser was not used in the exercise group. This study had three arms and reported that using the Multivariate Analysis of Variance method (MANOVA), the difference between the three arms was not statistically significant (the post-therapy means  SDs were 18  12, 29  13, and 19  14 for LLLT plus exercise, exercise alone, and LLLT alone groups respectively).</P>
<P>In summary, there is strong evidence from three trials that there is no significant difference in pain reduction between LLLT plus exercise and sham plus exercise treatment in short-term follow-up for individuals with chronic LBP. One small trial reported positive effects after 12 weeks, but this finding needs to be replicated in a larger trial.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-23 16:01:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven RCTs in the review. The quality of included studies varied, with the number of quality criteria met ranging from six (<LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>) to 11 (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>). All included studies were small, with sample sizes ranging from 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) to 80 (<LINK REF="STD-Longo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Longo 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toya 1994</LINK>) compared pain relief in LLLT with sham and all of them showed a statistically significant improvement in pain relief after laser treatment in short-term and intermediate-term follow-ups. Two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soriano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Soriano 1998</LINK>) were limited to sub-acute or chronic non-specific low-back pain. Because of the clinical heterogeneity among these studies, quantitative pooling was not possible. However, qualitative analysis suggested there is strong evidence that low level laser therapy may be beneficial for pain relief in patients with sub-acute or chronic non-specific low-back pain. But the trials were small and differed from each other in the definition and duration of low back pain, laser dosage, duration of treatment, and measures used to assess pain relief. In addition, although the studies met the majority of quality items, they performed poorly in randomisation and allocation concealment; it is shown that the inadequacy of allocation concealment in clinical trials is associated with an increased estimate of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>) compared pain in LLLT plus exercise with sham plus exercise. The pooled analysis of the findings of these studies for short-term follow-up did not show any significant effect in favour of the intervention. The laser dosage was inadequate according to WALT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-WALT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WALT 2005</LINK>) in these two studies. Although <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK> showed a significant decrease in pain in intermediate-term follow-up (12 weeks after randomisation), the considerable time delay in initiation of LLLT effects puts the results in a questionable light. The LLLT and sham plus exercise arms of this study did not differ in either follow-up. </P>
<P>In all studies reporting pain relief using VAS, the mean difference of pain scores was less than the minimum clinically significant improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>). Other systematic reviews on the effects of LLLT on pain showed small and controversial effects on pain relief. The systematic review of the effectiveness of LLLT on rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2006a</LINK>) suggested that LLLT may be effective at reducing pain relative to placebo, but the results were not statistically significant (WMD -11 mm; 95% CI -18 to 4). Another systematic review investigating the effectiveness of LLLT on joint disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK>) concluded that LLLT seemed to be effective in reducing pain due to chronic joint disorders (WMD -29.8 mm; 95% CI -40.7 to -18.9). A Cochrane review on LLLT for osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2006b</LINK>) reported conflicting results of different studies about the effectiveness of low level lasers for pain. <BR/>Therefore, because of the clinical heterogeneity of the studies, the small sample sizes and the small clinical effect sizes, the results of this review and clinical application for LLLT in the management of chronic LBP should be viewed with caution. We found a small number of studies that compared low-back pain-related disability or range of motion. Due to clinical heterogeneity, pooled analysis was only possible for two studies with inadequate dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1990</LINK>), and did not show any significant short-term effects of LLLT on disability measures. <LINK REF="STD-Djavid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Djavid 2007</LINK> did show a significant improvement in the 12th week follow-up for those who received LLLT. <LINK REF="STD-Basford-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Basford 1999</LINK>, which used a higher laser dosage than other studies, showed a significant improvement in disability measures. <LINK REF="REF-Bjordal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjordal 2003</LINK> found that after adjusting for tissue penetration, many laser doses used in many of the trials were too low to have any significant anti-inflammatory effects at target locations. </P>
<P>According to these seven trials, it seems that LLLT effects are clinically modest and should not substitute for other beneficial interventions, such as exercise and intensive multidisciplinary pain treatment programmes for chronic low-back pain, that are supported by strong evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>No serious adverse events were reported in the trials included in this review, but the total sample size of included trials was small for judgment about the safety of this intervention. </P>
<P>Low power lasers are sometimes irradiated to acupuncture points in addition to painful areas. The rationale for laser acupuncture is vastly different from phototherapy. Instead of using the direct effect of light on tissues to initiate a physiological response, in laser acupuncture, the selection of points is based on a diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm defined in acupuncture theories (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2006</LINK>). Therefore laser acupuncture studies were excluded from the current review.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Low level laser therapy, when contrasted to a sham treatment may be beneficial for pain relief and improved disability in patients with sub-acute or chronic non-specific low-back, although treatment effects are small. However, when LLLT is added to exercise and compared to exercise therapy, either with or without sham treatments, there appears to be little or no difference between the groups in pain and disability. Clinical heterogeneity and small trials also suggest that the results of this review may not be generalizable to a larger, more diverse, population. Therefore, based on our findings, LLLT should not be substituted for other beneficial interventions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs evaluating different lengths of treatment, different wavelengths and different dosages. Comparison of different LLLT treatments will be more reasonable if dose calculation methods are harmonized. Cost-effectiveness studies are recommended.</P>

<P>Was the method of randomization adequate? A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the treatment allocation concealed? Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the patient blinded to the intervention? The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
<P>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable? The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</P>
<P>Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group they were allocated to by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.</P>
<P>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? In order to receive a "yes", groups have to be similar at baseline characteristics.<BR/>
<BR/>Were co-interventions avoided or similar? Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or similar between the index and control groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the compliance acceptable in all groups? The reviewer determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar? Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.<BR/>

<P>Dr. Bjordal voiced this concern: To counter any possible misunderstandings I would like to add the following:. My comments were not approved of after having been taken into consideration, and I do not endorse the review conclusion. In fact, I strongly disagree with the review conclusion. This is probably the only Cochrane review where 5 out of 6 RCTs with acceptable methodological quality and partly or fully positive results, merits a non-positive review conclusion.<BR/>

<P>The Co-ordinating and Managing Editors forwarded this response to Dr. Bjordal: Although most of the trials showed some short term positive results compared with sham therapy, the results were small and not clinically important. Also, there was heterogeneity amongst the populations, doses of LLLT and comparisons that precluded a meta-analysis of the results. Therefore, the reviewers and the Editorial board of the Cochrane Back Review Group concluded that current data did not indicate a firm conclusion in favour of LLLT.<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>June 2007<BR/>Dr Bjordal voiced concerns about the accuracy of the analysis and conclusions of this review when it was first published in The Cochrane Library 2007, issue 2. The review authors and the Co-ordinating Editors agreed with the concerns and the review was subsequently withdrawn from The Cochrane Library. The literature search was updated in November 2007 and one newly published study included in the new analysis and conclusions. Dr Bjordal was asked to read the updated review and his comments were taken into consideration for the final review. The updated review is being re-published in The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2.</P>
