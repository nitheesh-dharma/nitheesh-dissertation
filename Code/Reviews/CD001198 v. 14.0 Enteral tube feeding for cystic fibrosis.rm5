<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-18 10:28:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We planned to review the evidence about the effects of tube feeding (via either the nose or the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes damage to the lungs and pancreas (an organ needed to produce chemicals that help to digest food). People with cystic fibrosis often need more calories in order to achieve a good nutritional status because their condition means food is not absorbed well and they burn more energy at rest and when breathing than people who don't have cystic fibrosis. They also often have poor appetites. Supplements are often given via a tube which is either placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric feeding) or directly into the stomach (gastrostomy feeding)), often overnight but sometimes during the day too. This type of feeding helps to improve weight gain, nutritional status, lung function and may improve quality of life. This is important as it is known that in cystic fibrosis nutritional status is closely linked to lung function. However, tube feeding is expensive and may also impact on self-esteem and body image. Tubes through the nose may also become dislodged by coughing. Tube feeding may also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but these issues are usually resolved by either changing the type of feed, rate of feeding or the way pancreatic enzymes are given. </P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We last searched for evidence on: 13 February 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 38 trials in our searches, but none of the trials put volunteers into different treatment groups completely at random comparing the effects of tube feeding to no tube feeding over a period of at least a month. We therefore did not include any trials in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Ideally, more research is needed to compare tube feeding with oral supplements and with normal diet. New trials should also look at when tube feeding should be started for the best results. These trials may be difficult to run as it may be wrong not to provide people with the extra calories they need, and when they need them, in this way.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-23 10:42:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Supplemental enteral tube feeding is widely used throughout the world to improve nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis. The methods mostly used, nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding, are expensive and may have a negative effect on self-esteem and body image. Reported use of enteral tube feeding suggests that it results in nutritional and respiratory improvement; but, efficacy has not been fully assessed by randomised controlled trials. It is acknowledged, however, that performing a randomised controlled trial would be difficult due to the ethics of withholding an intervention in a group of patients whose nutritional status necessitates it.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-18 10:31:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-18 10:30:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The nutritional status of most people with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be compromised for several reasons.</P>
<P>The majority of people with CF have a higher energy need, estimated to be up to 200% of normal requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Stallings-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallings 2008</LINK>). This is thought to be partly due to an increased resting energy expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Barclay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barclay 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorlochter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorlochter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magoffin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magoffin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moudiou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moudiou 2007</LINK>). Lung damage further increases calorie requirements as it increases the work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Zemel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zemel 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral calorie intake may be reduced by a poor appetite associated with respiratory infection, nausea from swallowed sputum or as a side effect of medications. Fat malabsorption leads to increased energy losses in the stools. However, even with the adequate control of fat malabsorption using pancreatic enzyme supplements people with CF may still be unable to meet their increased energy requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-18 10:31:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Enteral tube feeding is usually performed via the nasogastric or gastrostomy route. Nasogastric feeding involves passing a fine bore nasogastric tube through the nose into the stomach. This is usually done by the people with CF themselves or their carers on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</P>
<P>In children, gastrostomy tubes are usually sited under general anaesthetic. The tube is placed directly into the stomach. Subsequent changes may require general anaesthesia depending on the type of tube used.</P>
<P>In adults, gastrostomy tubes are usually placed under endoscopic guidance (PEG) as this does not require a general anaesthetic.</P>
<P>Whatever the type of tube, feeds can be administered as a continuous infusion (usually overnight) or as bolus feeding during the day. The person with CF or their carer is required to set up the equipment for feeding. Although this constitutes additional work, for many it is often a relief when tube feeding is commenced. Before the introduction of tube feeding, meal times may have become a battleground, because the child with CF is unable to consume sufficient energy to promote growth.</P>
<P>There are very few complications associated with enteral tube feeding. Those that do occur are usually minor and very easily treated. The main complications of nasogastric feeding are that the tube may become displaced by coughing; also, it may block and may therefore need changing frequently. Nasogastric tubes may also cause nasal irritation (<LINK REF="STD-Pencharz-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pencharz 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gastrostomy insertion can be associated with post-insertional pain, but this is usually short-lived and can usually be managed with adequate pain relief. Leakage and infection around the gastrostomy site occasionally occurs (<LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>), this usually responds to application of a steroid and antibiotic cream. In a minority of people, overnight feeding may result in an increased tendency to gastro-oesophageal reflux and easy vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>). In severe cases this may necessitate a Nissans fundoplication (<LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>); less severe cases can be treated medically. Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are usually resolved by either changing the type of feed, rate of infusion, method of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy or addition of adjunctive therapies.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-23 11:10:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>A major objective in CF care is to achieve normal growth in childhood and to maintain this in adult life. In a minority of people with CF, routine treatments and oral supplements fail to realise normal nutritional status. Some of these people have been given high-calorie liquid enteral tube feeds, usually overnight, delivered by a pump via nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-13 13:31:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is well established that nutritional and respiratory status are closely linked in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Corey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pedreira-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedreira 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zemel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zemel 2000</LINK>). In recent trials, poor weight (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2000</LINK>), height (<LINK REF="REF-Beker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beker 2001</LINK>) and body mass index (BMI) (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 2006</LINK>) have been shown to be independent predictors of mortality in CF.</P>
<P>Enteral tube feeding can be a highly effective way of improving the well-being of a person with CF. Although it can give rise to issues regarding body image as tubes can be unsightly. Poor weight and undernutrition have also been associated with poor body image. Consideration should be given to all aspects of body image.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of previously published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conway-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conway-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology </I>and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work is identified by searching through the abstract books of three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference, the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant sections of the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/cochrane_clsysrev_crglist_fs.html">Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module</A>.</P>

<P>For future updates of this review, if we find and include any trials, we will apply the following methods. For binary outcome measures, we aim to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across trials, (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls). For continuous outcomes, we plan to record either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation or standard error for each group. For continuous outcomes we also plan to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference.</P>

In general, the papers report that both nasogastric and gastrostomy tube feeding are well-tolerated by people with CF.</P>
<P>There were few adverse effects associated with enteral tube feeding reported in the excluded studies. These were generally mild and included: transient nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Boland-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Boland 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelekanos-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pelekanos 1990</LINK>); vomiting (mainly associated with coughing) (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1985</LINK>); gastro-oesophageal reflux (<LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dyke-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dyke 2011</LINK>); early morning fullness with loss of appetite (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerkins-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerkins 2012</LINK>); abdominal pain and loose stools (<LINK REF="STD-Pelekanos-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pelekanos 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>); disturbed sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Caraher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Caraher 2012</LINK>); bed-wetting (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Biervliet-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Biervliet 2004</LINK>); night sweats (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Biervliet-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Biervliet 2004</LINK>); irritation of the nose and throat (nasogastric feeding) (<LINK REF="STD-Pencharz-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pencharz 1984</LINK>) and pain (<LINK REF="STD-Caraher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Caraher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Biervliet-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Biervliet 2004</LINK>); leakage (<LINK REF="STD-Caraher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Caraher 2012</LINK>); and granulation and infection of the gastrostomy site (<LINK REF="STD-Truby-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Truby 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeleur-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeleur 2013</LINK>). One study also identified non-specific GI issues, poor adherence and non-specific psychosocial issues to be problematic (<LINK REF="STD-Jerkins-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerkins 2012</LINK>)</P>
<P>Being underweight can have an adverse effect on body image and quality of life. The impact of introducing enteral tube feeding may, in some, raise further concerns about body image and self-esteem and have a negative impact on quality of life. Two excluded study reported that participants were self-conscious and had a poor body image post-gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement (<LINK REF="STD-Caraher-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Caraher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chinuck-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chinuck 2011</LINK>). Awareness of these issues together with careful preparation and counselling of patients allowing for a period of adjustment, adaptation and acceptance is important.</P>
<P>Enteral tube feeding is widely accepted as a treatment or intervention in CF centres, but the evidence-base for this does not include RCTs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-23 15:22:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-02-23 15:22:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>No firm conclusions can be made about supplemental enteral tube feeding from the information currently available. Clinicians must balance possible potential benefit against the invasive nature and cost of procedures and products involved for each individual. There are no eligible trials of supplemental enteral feeding for one month or more. Data from other studies, either of shorter duration or not case controlled, do indicate that nutritional status can be improved; but it is not clear if this is translated into improved health.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to February 2015. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-23 11:29:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review has identified that there are no well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre RCTs to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of supplemental enteral tube feeding compared to normal oral feeding and oral supplement feeding in CF. However, such trials would be very difficult to undertake in this patient group as ethical approval is unlikely to be granted for a trial withholding an intervention which will probably be of benefit.</P>
<P>Any future RCTs could address issues such as the most appropriate timing of the introduction of enteral tube feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1998</LINK>), different effects of tube feeding at different stages of disease severity, appropriate methods of administration, enzyme therapy and appropriate feed composition. These trials should be of sufficient length to fully assess the impact of any improvement on nutritional status, respiratory illness, the frequency of respiratory exacerbations, respiratory function tests, morbidity and mortality and quality of life.</P>
