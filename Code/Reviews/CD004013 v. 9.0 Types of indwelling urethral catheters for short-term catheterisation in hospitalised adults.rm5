<P>
<I>
<B>Background on the condition</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Urethral catheters are small tubes passed into the bladder via the urethra (outlet for urine). They are often used for a short time after major surgery. Urethral catheters are also used if a person is unable to empty the bladder when they need to (urinary retention). They are also used for monitoring urine output in hospitalised patients. About half of all hospitalised adults who have urethral catheters for longer than a week will get a urinary tract infection (UTI).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>The main findings of the review</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Twenty-six trials were included in this systematic review involving 12,422 hospitalised adults in 25 parallel group trials, and 27,878 adults in one large cluster-randomised cross-over trial.The review of evidence from trials found that although antiseptic-coated (silver alloy) catheters reduced the number of bacteria in the urine, they did not reduce the number of UTIs caused by the presence of the catheter. Catheters coated with antimicrobials (antibiotics, nitrofurazone) designed to kill or stop the growth of bacteria may reduce both the number of bacteria in the urine as well as number of people having UTI caused by the presence of the catheter. However, the evidence is relatively weak, and any benefit is likely to be small and hence unlikely to be meaningful to either patients or clinicians.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>These antibiotic catheters are also more likely to cause discomfort for patients compared with standard catheters, and they are more expensive.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>The best approaches to reducing the risk of UTI include reducing the numbers of unnecessary catheterisations, or reducing the time period during which the catheter is used by removing it as early as possible.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:05:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection. The major associated cause is indwelling urethral catheters. Several measures have been introduced to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). One of these measures is the introduction of specialised urethral catheters that have been designed to reduce the risk of infection. These include antiseptic-coated and antimicrobial-impregnated catheters.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:05:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of different types of indwelling urethral catheters in reducing the risk of UTI and to assess their impact on other outcomes in adults who require short-term urethral catheterisation in hospitals.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-15 12:26:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group's Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 9 September 2014). We also examined the bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted catheter manufacturer representatives for trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:19:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing types of indwelling urethral catheters for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults. 'Short-term' is defined as a duration of catheterisation which is intended to be less than or equal to 14 days.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:13:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or consultation with a third party. We processed data as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 14:24:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-six trials met the inclusion criteria involving 12,422 hospitalised adults in 25 parallel group trials, and 27,878 adults in one large cluster-randomised cross-over trial. No trials compared one antiseptic catheter versus another, nor an antimicrobial catheter versus another.</P>
<P>
<B>Antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters versus standard indwelling urethral catheters</B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome, symptomatic CAUTI was reported in one large trial with a low risk of bias, comparing silver alloy hydrogel-coated latex catheter (antiseptic-coated) against a standard polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated latex catheter (control). The trial used a pragmatic, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-based definition for symptomatic CAUTI. For the comparison between silver alloy-coated catheter versus standard catheter, there was no significant difference in symptomatic CAUTI incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16).</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, the included trials reported on two types of antiseptic catheters (coated with either silver oxide or silver alloy). For the outcome of bacteriuria, silver oxide catheters were not associated with any statistically significant reduction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.13). These catheters are no longer manufactured. Silver alloy catheters achieved a slight but statistically significant reduction in bacteriuria (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92). However, the one large trial with a low risk of bias did not support this finding (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16). The randomised cross-over trial of silver alloy catheters versus standard catheters was excluded from the pooled results because data were not available prior to crossover. The results of this trial showed less bacteriuria in the silver alloy catheter group.</P>
<P>For the outcome of discomfort whilst the catheter was in-situ, fewer patients with silver alloy catheters complained of discomfort compared with standard catheters (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96).</P>
<P>
<B>Antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters versus standard indwelling urethral catheters</B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure, symptomatic CAUTI was reported in one large trial with a low risk of bias, comparing nitrofurazone-impregnated silicone catheter (antimicrobial-impregnated) against a standard PTFE-coated latex catheter (control). The nitrofurazone catheter achieved a reduction in symptomatic CAUTI incidence which was of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99).</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, the included trials reported on two types of antimicrobial catheters (impregnated with either nitrofurazone or minocycline/rifampicin). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, compared with standard catheters, were found to lower the rate of bacteriuria in the antimicrobial group for both minocycline and rifampicin (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.73), and nitrofurazone (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85). The minocycline and rifampicin catheter is no longer manufactured.</P>
<P>For the outcome of discomfort whilst the catheter was in-situ, more patients with nitrofurazone catheters complained of pain whilst the catheter was in-situ compared with standard catheters (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.41). For the period after catheter removal, more patients with nitrofurazone catheters complained of pain than standard catheters (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.57).</P>
<P>
<B>Antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters versus antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters</B>
</P>
<P>One large trial compared antimicrobial-impregnated (nitrofurazone) catheters versus silver alloy-coated (antiseptic-coated) catheters. The results showed people were less likely to have a symptomatic CAUTI with nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters (228/2153, 10.6%) compared with silver alloy-coated catheters (263/2097, 12.5%), but this was of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00). They did, however, have significantly less bacteriuria (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91),</P>
<P>While the catheter was in-situ (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.70), and on removal (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.45), nitrofurazone catheters were associated with more discomfort compared with silver-coated catheters.</P>
<P>
<B>One type of standard indwelling urethral catheter versus another type of standard indwelling urethral catheter</B>
</P>
<P>None of the trials comparing standard catheters versus other types of standard catheters measured symptomatic CAUTI. In terms of reducing bacteriuria, individual trials were too small to show whether one type of standard catheter was superior to another type. For the outcome of urethral reactions, fully siliconised catheters appeared to be superior to latex-based catheters. However, the trials involved small numbers of participants. There were no statistically significant differences between the different catheters for all other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:16:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Silver alloy-coated catheters were not associated with a statistically significant reduction in symptomatic CAUTI, and are considerably more expensive. Nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters reduced the risk of symptomatic CAUTI and bacteriuria, although the magnitude of reduction was low and hence may not be clinically important. However, they are more expensive than standard catheters. They are also more likely to cause discomfort than standard catheters.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:50:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection, accounting for between 20% and 40% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Emmerson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmerson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>). Up to 80% of these UTIs occurring in hospitals can be attributed to the use of indwelling urethral catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Bryan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turck-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turck 1981</LINK>). Catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) account for significant morbidity, with symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, haematuria, fever or bladder pain, or more serious complications such as bloodstream infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bryan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krieger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krieger 1983</LINK>). In addition, healthcare costs increase by prolonging hospital stay, and this can adversely affect patients&#8217; health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tambyah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambyah 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Urethral catheters are one of the most commonly applied medical devices. The indications for short-term catheterisation include monitoring of urine output during the perioperative stage or in acutely unwell patients, as part of a urological procedure, or the treatment of patients with acute urinary retention. The prevalence of catheterisation is high, with up to a quarter of patients admitted to hospital requiring urethral catheterisation at some stage during their stay (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1999</LINK>). For patients with urethral catheters, there is a cumulative daily risk of 5% of developing bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1981</LINK>) (i.e. presence of bacteria in the urine), with the risk increasing to 35% and 70%, after 7 and 14 days of indwelling catheterisation, respectively. Whilst bacteriuria does not normally cause symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic bacteriuria), it does increase the risk of developing a symptomatic UTI; it has been estimated that symptomatic UTI occurs in 20% of patients with bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-Garibaldi-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garibaldi 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartstein-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartstein 1981</LINK>). It is also associated with a small risk of bloodstream infection (&lt; 1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Bryan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krieger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krieger 1983</LINK>); whilst this risk is relatively low, bloodstream infection is associated with a high mortality rate of approximately 30%. The presence of bacteriuria in hospital patients with an indwelling catheter is also a potential source of cross-infection, particularly in critical care units, with an estimated risk per episode of 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>). Other factors that increase the risk of infection include female gender, older age, impaired immunity, severity of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1998</LINK>), and care process factors, such as lack of antibiotic use, longer duration of catheterisation, catheter insertion or maintenance by poorly trained personnel, and deviation from catheter care protocols (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of the microbiology of UTIs, infections associated with short-term catheterisation typically involve a single organism, in contrast with long-term catheterisation, where polymicrobial infection is frequent (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009</LINK>). Although a variety of micro-organisms may be associated with CAUTI, the commonest pathogens are enteric Gram negative bacilli (<LINK REF="REF-Shuman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shuman 2010</LINK>) <I>Escherichia coli </I>(<I>E. Coli</I>) is the most frequently isolated single species, but other species such as <I>Klebsiella </I>spp., <I>Proteus </I>spp<I>. </I>and <I>Enterobacter </I>spp. are also commonly identified. <I>Enterococci</I>, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>) and <I>Candida </I>spp. are also important causes of CAUTI, particularly in patients within critical care settings. Forty <I>Staphylococci</I> and other Gram-negative bacilli are isolated less frequently (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The criterion for diagnosis of a symptomatic CAUTI varies significantly in the literature. However, efforts have been made by healthcare organisations, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to standardise definitions, based on different scenarios (e.g. UTI in presence of a urethral catheter, symptomatic UTI, etc.) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009</LINK>). It is worthwhile noting that the CDC&#8217;s definitions for UTI have undergone several revisions in the past two decades. In line with CDC definitions, past and present, which reflect clinically relevant outcomes, for purposes of this review, a positive urine culture reported without any consideration for patient symptoms is defined as bacteriuria rather than a UTI.</P>
<P>Several strategies and policies aimed at reducing CAUTI have been introduced. These can be summarised as follows: (1) education of patients, their caregivers and healthcare personnel, in terms of hand hygiene and steps in preventing spread of infection; (2) reduction in the prevalence of catheterisation by assessing the need for catheterisation, and restricting the intervention to those who have no other alternative of achieving bladder drainage; (3) use of aseptic technique for catheter insertion; (4) use of antibiotic prophylaxis in selected high risk groups at insertion based on local antibiotic prescribing policies; (5) maintenance of a sterile, closed drainage system by obtaining urine specimens from the sampling port, positioning of drainage bag above floor level and below bladder level; (6) frequent emptying of drainage bag to maintain urine flow and prevent reflux, and daily washing of urethral meatus; (7) minimising the duration of catheterisation by regularly reviewing the need for catheterisation, and by aiming for early removal of catheter; and (8) coating or impregnation of catheter surface with antiseptic or antimicrobial substances (<LINK REF="REF-Brosnahan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosnahan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumm 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willson 2009</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-12 12:55:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there are many types of catheters available. Standard indwelling catheters are made from a variety of materials including: polyvinyl chlorine, plastic, plain latex, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated latex, hydrogel-coated latex, silicone elastomer, pure silicone hydrogel and polymer hydromer (<LINK REF="REF-Pomfret-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomfret 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>). Specialised urethral catheters have been developed specifically to reduce the risk of infection. A common approach is to coat the catheter with antiseptic or antimicrobial agents either on the outer surface, the lumen, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1998</LINK>), or impregnated into the catheter material.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-27 11:26:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiseptic agents are substances which kill bacteria and other micro-organisms. The most common antiseptic agent used is silver. Silver has long been recognised as an antiseptic agent active against a variety of uropathogens through multiple mechanisms of action (<LINK REF="REF-Franken-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franken 2007</LINK>). Silver exposure results in limited toxicity to human tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Gosheger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosheger 2004</LINK>) and does not appear to induce microbial resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Percival-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Percival 2005</LINK>). Two types of silver-based agents have been used to coat urethral catheters: silver alloy and silver oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antibiotics are antimicrobial drugs which can either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth to stop or prevent infections. Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters have also been developed using various types of antibiotics active against expected uropathogens. These antimicrobial agents are impregnated into the external and internal luminal catheter surfaces, and elute over time into the external surface-urethral mucosa and internal lumen&#8211;urinary boundaries (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-26 13:50:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several systematic reviews have investigated the effectiveness of antiseptic and antimicrobial catheters in reducing CAUTIs (<LINK REF="REF-Drekonja-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drekonja 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saint-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumm 2008</LINK>), including the previous update of the present review (<LINK REF="REF-Shuman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shuman 2010</LINK>). The results of these reviews suggest that silver alloy-coated catheters and nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters may reduce the incidence of bacteriuria in hospitalised patients catheterised for less than two weeks in comparison with standard catheters. The magnitude of relative risk reduction varied in each of the analyses due to different inclusion criteria, ranging from 16% to 48%. However, the far majority of included studies in those reviews defined CAUTI based solely on microbiological identification of bacteriuria without any patient-driven or clinician-defined contribution to the primary outcomes used. Since the last Cochrane review update, the results of a large RCT which compared silver alloy-coated and nitrofurazone-impregnated short-term urethral catheters versus standard catheters and which assessed clinically relevant outcomes, have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the effects of these specialised catheters in comparison with standard ones in reducing the incidence of symptomatic CAUTI in hospitalised patients requiring short-term catheterisation, but also taking into account other factors, such as ease of use, comfort and cost that may influence decision-making regarding these catheters. For the purpose of this review, short-term was defined as up to and including 14 days, or other temporary short-term use as defined by the trialists.</P>

<P>We classified the primary and secondary outcomes above as critical, important or not important from patients' perspective for decision-making. The GRADE working group strongly recommends including up to seven critical outcomes in a systematic review to be assessed via the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We contacted content experts to identify outcomes of importance to patients undergoing short-term urethral catheterisation that could be included in a Cochrane systematic review. The content experts included clinicians, nurses, and a health economist. Subsequently, through the Urological Cancer Charity (UCAN), we identified five individuals who had undergone urethral catheterisation and invited them to take part in a group discussion to identify important outcomes from their perspective. The participants were not aware of the views of the content experts. On the whole, the participants were in agreement with the content experts regarding the key outcomes of importance. For example, they suggested that infections and discomfort were certainly important from their point of view. However, they also highlighted other outcomes as being meaningful and important such as length of hospital stay and the duration of catheterisation. Interestingly, participants also raised issues around being catheterised and the impact on self esteem and ability to wear clothes comfortably (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2013</LINK>).

<P>We processed included trial data as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When appropriate, we undertook meta-analysis. We categorised comparisons by type of intervention catheter. We performed sensitivity analyses that indicated that the results of silver oxide versus standard catheters and silver alloy versus standard catheters should not be combined. However, we combined data from different types of standard catheters for comparison with antimicrobial-impregnated and antiseptic-coated catheters. Where possible, we performed subgroup analyses, comparing outcomes by gender and according to whether the participants were receiving systemic antibiotics.</P>
<P>For categorical outcomes we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a relative risk. For continuous variables we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference (MD). We used a fixed-effect model to calculate the pooled relative risks, MD and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). However, we also checked results using a random-effects model. We compared trials to assess and investigate the likelihood of important clinical heterogeneity. Where we observed significant statistical heterogeneity, we offered an explanation in the text. We could not apply publication bias using a funnel plot as there were fewer than 10 trials in the meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome measure, i.e. 'symptomatic CAUTI' was either not assessed or poorly defined in the great majority of studies. Very few studies defined symptomatic CAUTI based on standardised definitions. <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> defined symptomatic CAUTI based on the development of UTI symptoms and signs, and prescription of antibiotics for a presumed UTI, at any time point during catheterisation, or up to six weeks postcatheter removal. This is a variation of a previous CDC symptomatic CAUTI definition, although the time point of six weeks was longer than any standard definitions. This primary outcome did not include any microbiological evidence of a UTI. However, the same study also included symptomatic CAUTI with microbiological evidence as a secondary outcome measure.</P>
<P>Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK>) defined bacteriuria or symptomatic or non-symptomatic UTI as &#8216;&#8805; 10<SUP>5</SUP> cfu/mL&#8217;, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Thibon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thibon 2000</LINK> defined UTI as &#8216;bacteriuria (&gt; 10<SUP>5</SUP> cfu/mL) with &gt; 10 leucocytes per mm<SUP>3</SUP> of urine'. Darouiche and colleagues defined 'symptomatic bacteriuria' as being 'diagnosed by the healthcare provider' (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main outcome measure for most studies was bacteriuria without any consideration of patient symptoms. The exception to this was <LINK REF="STD-Stenzelius-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stenzelius 2011</LINK>, which assessed bacteriuria (&gt; 10<SUP>5</SUP> cfu/mL) and urinary symptoms during and after the catheterisation period. There was significant heterogeneity in terms of the definition of bacteriuria across trials, ranging from 'greater than 10<SUP>2</SUP> colony forming units per mL' to 'greater than 10<SUP>6</SUP> colony forming units per mL'.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> also measured other outcomes, including the development of adverse events, serious events (including urinary sepsis and death), health-related quality of life (based on the EQ-5D questionnaire), and economic outcomes.</P>
<P>An outcome of interest that was included in the trials of standard catheters was catheter-related infection. In addition, one small Japanese trial of antiseptic-coated catheters reported data for: catheter-associated pain, urethral discharge and catheter-related hypersensitivity or allergy (<LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 1993</LINK>). The six trials that randomised participants to two different types of standard catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Chene-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chene 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalambheti-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kalambheti 1965</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Nacey-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nacey 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nickel-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nickel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talja-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Talja 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tidd-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Tidd 1976</LINK>) investigated outcomes of catheter-related infection or catheter-related urethritis and urethral inflammatory reaction. One trial only reported an adverse effect, meatal stricture (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from variation in the definition of infection, the timing of the outcome measurement and duration of follow-up was also diverse. Only six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nickel-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nickel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK>) monitored catheter care violations. The method of obtaining urine specimens was varied. The majority of trials acquired samples from the catheter sampling port (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeberg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 1993</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Economic outcomes</HEADING>
<P>An economic analysis was performed in two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK> calculated the total catheter-related costs by summing the cost of infections and the cost of catheters and their components, and cost savings were estimated by subtracting the total catheter-related cost for silver-coated catheters from the total cost for uncoated catheters. The analysis included an estimation of both a lower and higher approximation of costs. <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> measured cost-effectiveness using a decision-analytical model, which compared three types of catheters in terms of both UK NHS costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), based on responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire.</P>

Eighty per cent of participants in one of the trials received systemic antibiotics (the reasons were not stated in the trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Riley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 1995</LINK>). All trials included men and women admitted to surgical or medical wards, or both, although Riley had more women in the treatment group (451/745) than in the control group (285/564).

Further analysis of women and men separately who received systemic antibiotics suggested that women were protected from bacteriuria with silver oxide catheters (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79, <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>.5), but there was not enough evidence either way for men (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.13, <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>.6).</P>

The timing of the outcome measurement varied considerably between trials. For the analysis, the outcome of bacteriuria was separated into two groups based on the time point of measurement: less than one week of catheterisation, and more than one week of catheterisation. Seven trials reported bacteriuria at less than one week (<LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeberg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thibon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thibon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verleyen-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Verleyen 1999b</LINK>

<P>The results of a cluster-randomised cross-over trial comparing silver alloy with standard (silicone) catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK>) were not included in the meta-analyses because data were not available prior to crossover (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), and also because of the heterogeneity of the outcome definition, which included patients with &#8216;bacteriuria or symptomatic or non-symptomatic UTI&#8217; (collectively defined as &#8216;&#8805; 10<SUP>5</SUP> cfu/m&#8217;). The results of the rate of bacteriuria per 1000 patient days were 2.66 versus 3.35 (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99), the rate of bacteriuria per 100 patients was 1.10 versus 1.36 (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.01) and the rate of bacteriuria per 100 catheters was 2.13 versus 3.12 (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>) of silver alloy versus standard catheters reported on patient-reported discomfort as a tertiary outcome.

The primary economic outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Healthcare costs were estimated from UK National Health Service (NHS) sources with QALYs calculated from participant completion of the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). The analysis suggested that silver alloy catheters were unlikely to be cost-effective for use within UK NHS hospitals at all incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold values of between GBP 0 to GBP 50,000. <LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK> reported that for the duration of the trial (one year) silver alloy hydrogel catheter usage resulted in a total estimated catheter-related cost reduction of between 3.3% and 35.5%.

All but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>) defined bacteriuria as &#8216;&#8805; 10<SUP>3</SUP> cfu/mL&#8217;; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> defined it as &#8216;&#8805; 10<SUP>4 </SUP>cfu/mL&#8217;. <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK> also included funguria as an outcome.</P>
<P>The trials differed in their timing of the outcome measurement. Three trials investigated the outcomes at less than one week (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> did not report bacteriuria at different time periods, but since the majority of patients were catheterised for less than one week (median duration of catheterisation two days, interquartile range one to three days), the outcome for bacteriuria for the study was grouped under &#8216;less than one week&#8217;. Results were pooled using a fixed-effect model and indicated that at less than one week of catheterisation, the risk of bacteriuria was statistically significantly reduced in the nitrofurazone impregnated catheter group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>.1).</P>
<P>For the outcome of bacteriuria at more than one week, only one study measured this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Habdan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Al Habdan 2003</LINK>). The benefit from nitrofurazone impregnated catheters in preventing bacteriuria at more than one week was inconclusive, due to the small number of patients and relatively few events resulting in wide CIs (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.33, <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>.1)</P>

The results suggested that for the period whilst the catheter was in place, and on removal, nitrofurazone catheters were associated with more discomfort, with more patients complaining of discomfort compared with standard catheters (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.41 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>.1); and RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.57 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>.1) respectively).</P>

<P>One trial reported on economic outcomes comparing nitrofurazone catheters with standard PTFE-coated catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>). A formal cost-benefit analysis using a decision-analytical model was undertaken. The primary economic outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Healthcare costs were estimated from UK NHS sources with QALYs calculated from participant completion of the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). The analysis suggested that nitrofurazone catheters could potentially be cost-saving, with an 84% probability that the incremental cost per QALY would be under GBP 30,000 (i.e. the willingness-to-pay threshold typically used in the UK).</P>

This trial included men after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and compared a silicone catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampicin with a standard (silicone) catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>). Outcome measures included bacteriuria (greater than 10<SUP>4</SUP> colony forming units per mL) at days three, seven and 14, and symptomatic UTI (timing not stated) as defined by the healthcare provider (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of 56 men in the antimicrobial-impregnated catheter group had symptomatic UTI compared with six of 68 men in the control group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.63, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.2).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 13:31:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified 26 eligible trials that addressed four of the six prestated hypotheses. In addition, three ongoing studies were identified (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00482547-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00482547 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01681511-2012" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01681511 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02198833-2014" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02198833 2014</LINK>). One trial compared an antiseptic catheter with an antibiotic catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>). No trials were identified that compared one type of antiseptic catheter with another type of antiseptic catheter, or one type of antibiotic catheter with another type of antibiotic catheter. Short-term is defined as a duration of catheterisation which was intended to be less than 14 days.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters versus standard indwelling urethral catheters.</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included twelve trials that randomised a total of 8317 hospitalised adults (4133 catheterised with antiseptic catheters and 4184 with standard catheters) and one cross-over trial that randomised hospital wards of 27,878 hospitalised adults. There were three types of antiseptic catheters: silver oxide, silver alloy and noble metal alloy (composed of a mixture of gold, palladium and silver alloy). Most of the trials included in the pooled analysis were small, with only three trials stating they used a power calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenzelius-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stenzelius 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thibon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thibon 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>For silver oxide (antiseptic-coated) catheters, none of the included three trials measured the prespecified primary outcome i.e. symptomatic CAUTI. The catheters were not found to prevent bacteriuria in short-term catheterised hospitalised adults in the three trials included in the analysis. Subgroup analysis by gender in one trial did suggest that women are less likely to develop bacteriuria if they use silver oxide catheters, whereas the evidence for men was inconclusive (<LINK REF="STD-Riley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 1995</LINK>). The same trial also suggested that systemic antibiotic use also decreased the rate of bacteriuria in the silver oxide group, particularly in women. These subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously, particularly when the overall result suggests no difference. However, silver oxide catheters are no longer manufactured and therefore these data are no longer clinically relevant.</P>
<P>For silver alloy (antiseptic-coated) catheters, out of the 10 included studies, only one trial measured the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>), which did not find any statistically significant reduction in symptomatic CAUTI. This finding was based on two different definitions of symptomatic CAUTI. In both instances, the experimental catheters did not demonstrate any benefit. The study was a well designed and robust RCT, specifically designed to determine the effectiveness of silver alloy catheters in comparison with standard catheters as used in UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Although previous studies (including the present review) found a slight but statistically significant reduction in bacteriuria from the pooled analysis of nine studies (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92), the <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> trial confirms that such a reduction is neither clinically significant nor meaningful because of the lack of impact on symptomatic UTI. However, the authors of this trial acknowledged that the trial reflected the way short-term catheters were used in UK NHS hospitals, where the median duration of catheterisation for the entire cohort (n = 7102) was only two days.</P>
<P>To address the issue of whether duration of catheterisation had an effect on the outcome, the authors conducted a subgroup analysis, which showed that the risk of infection was not influenced by the duration of catheterisation. This demonstrates the importance of measuring outcomes which are clinically important and meaningful to patients in clinical trials, rather than surrogate outcomes such as bacteriuria.</P>
<P>Other limitations in the meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of bacteriuria included clinical heterogeneity, such as diverse populations, use of antibiotics and differences in the standard catheter chosen as the comparison. Only one trial reported catheter care violations (<LINK REF="STD-Liedberg-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Liedberg 1990b</LINK>). The method of urine specimen collection also differed between the trials, from two trials using the gold standard method of suprapubic puncture (<LINK REF="STD-Verleyen-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Verleyen 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verleyen-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Verleyen 1999b</LINK>), five using various methods to collect the specimen directly from the catheter and one trial collecting the specimen from the drainage bag, which increases the likelihood of bacterial contamination.</P>
<P>For noble metal alloy (antiseptic-coated) catheters, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stenzelius-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stenzelius 2011</LINK>) found a dramatic reduction in bacteriuria in comparison with standard silicone catheters (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.95). Rather oddly, the primary outcome of the study was bacteriuria rather than symptomatic CAUTI, although there was an opportunity for the trialists to measure symptomatic UTI, considering they assessed for the presence of urinary symptoms. As such, the clinical significance of the findings remains uncertain.</P>
<P>Catheterised men and women generally develop bacteriuria in different ways due to their anatomical differences. Men are more likely to develop catheter-related bacteriuria via the intraluminal route from a contaminated drainage bag, while in women contamination is more often transurethral when bacteria migrate from the periurethral region after faecal contamination. One major limitation of the silver alloy trials was that subgroup analysis was not possible by gender. Subgrouping of the results by duration of catheterisation was possible, however, and this indicated that the effect of silver alloy catheters on bacteriuria persisted beyond one week of catheterisation up to two weeks.</P>
<P>In terms of adverse effects or catheter-related discomfort, only three trials assessed these outcomes on antiseptic catheters compared with standard catheters. <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> found silver alloy catheters were no worse than standard catheters, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Stenzelius-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stenzelius 2011</LINK> found no differences between noble metal alloy catheters and standard catheters. Although <LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 1993</LINK> measured patient comfort and adverse effects related to silver oxide catheters, the trial was underpowered and poorly designed, and the methods for collecting the secondary outcome data were not described; this precluded any meaningful interpretation of the trial findings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluation</HEADING>
<P>There have been no trials that investigated the issue of whether patients catheterised with antiseptic catheters may develop antimicrobial resistance. Two trials undertook economic evaluation. <LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK> was a large cluster-randomised cross-over trial which also included an economic analysis; the study found data in favour of silver alloy hydrogel catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Karchmer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karchmer 2000</LINK>). Silver alloy catheters were significantly more expensive than standard catheters. The cost estimates derived in the trial used both a low and high approximation of costs and calculated catheter-related cost reduction of between 3.3% and 35.5%. The limitation of this trial was firstly, the randomisation of hospital wards rather than individual patients, and secondly, the risk of cross-over of catheters leading to contamination between groups. (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> undertook formal economic analysis of silver alloy catheters versus standard catheters using an economic model. In the absence of any evidence of clinical effectiveness, the trial concluded that silver alloy catheters were unlikely to be cost-effective for the UK NHS.</P>
<P>Elsewhere, outside this review, the issue of cost-effectiveness of silver alloy catheters has also been covered by other studies, albeit in an indirect way. Plowman developed an illustrative model of the annual costs and benefits associated with the use of silver alloy catheters in hospitalised medical and surgical inpatients in NHS hospitals in England (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2001</LINK>). The model suggested that a reduction in the incidence of UTI of 14.6% in catheterised medical patients and 11.4% in catheterised surgical patients would ensure that the cost of silver alloy catheters was the same as standard catheters. Any further reduction in incidence would then result in cost savings. In another study conducted in the USA, <LINK REF="REF-Saint-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 2000</LINK> developed a cost-benefit decision model using a simulated cohort of 1000 hospitalised general medical, surgical, urologic and intensive care patients requiring short-term catheterisation (two to ten days) comparing silver alloy with standard catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 2000</LINK>). The results were calculated using a relative risk reduction of bacteriuria with the use of silver alloy catheters of 25%. They calculated that the use of silver alloy catheters could lead to a 47% relative decrease in the incidence of symptomatic UTI (from 30 to 16 cases per 1000 patients), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 74, as well as a relative decrease in resultant bacteraemia of 44% (from 4.5 to 2.5 cases), with a NNT of 500. Using a multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, they indicated that silver alloy catheters could provide benefit in all cases and cost savings in 84% of cases. However, without any clinical benefit in terms of significant reductions in symptomatic CAUTI, it is hard to imagine how these potential economic benefits could have been achieved.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters versus standard indwelling urethral catheters</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included the results of six trials that randomised a total of 5248 hospitalised adults (2625 catheterised with antimicrobial-impregnated catheters and 2623 with standard catheters). There were two types of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters: minocycline combined with rifampicin and nitrofurazone alone.</P>
<P>As with the antiseptic trials, the antimicrobial trials included in the pooled analysis were of small numbers of participants, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>. Only <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> measured symptomatic CAUTI, whilst the rest measured bacteriuria as the main outcome measure.</P>
<P>Of the six studies, only one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Darouiche 1999</LINK>) investigated minocycline- and rifampicin-impregnated catheters compared with a standard catheter. This relatively small trial was not powered to detect differences in bacteriuria. It included a very limited population (men after radical prostatectomy) and therefore the benefit shown in reducing bacteriuria in those catheterised for less than a week may not be applicable to other groups of adult patients, particularly women. In fact, one of the inclusion criterion was sterile urine prior to catheterisation which would be unlikely to be found in more high risk groups. There was not enough evidence to show whether this difference persisted after the first week. Adverse effects, such as antimicrobial resistance to the catheters over time, were not investigated. Moreover, minocycline- and rifampicin-impregnated catheters are no longer in clinical use and therefore these data are no longer clinically relevant.</P>
<P>There were five other antimicrobial trials that investigated nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters against standard controls. Based on only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>), the review found that nitrofurazone catheters achieved a slight but statistically significant reduction in symptomatic CAUTI, depending on the definition of the outcome. For the outcome of bacteriuria, the pooled data from four studies also showed a significant reduction at one week. The data regarding duration of catheterisation beyond one week were inconclusive.</P>
<P>Of the four trials that investigated the effect of nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters against standard catheters on bacteriuria at less than one week, three of these studies were well designed to minimise bias (<LINK REF="STD-Maki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK>
<U>); </U>
<LINK REF="STD-Maki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stensballe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stensballe 2007</LINK> were relatively small trials. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>) demonstrated bias in its selection criteria with an unequal distribution of men and women in the control and treatment groups.</P>
<P>In terms of catheter-related discomfort, <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> was the only study which assessed this outcome for nitrofurazone catheters in comparison with standard catheters. Up to 43% more patients who received the nitrofurazone catheter complained of catheter-related discomfort for the period whilst the catheter was in situ and on catheter removal, compared with standard catheters. This finding is likely to be clinically relevant to patients, and is probably due to the different properties of the catheter material.</P>
<P>Taken together, these data indicate a small but statistically significant benefit regarding clinically relevant outcomes achieved by these catheters, whilst being associated with more discomfort.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluation</HEADING>
<P>Data regarding economic evaluation of nitrofurazone catheters were obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>, who undertook formal economic analysis of nitrofurazone catheters versus standard catheters using an economic model. Based on incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculated from the perspective of the UK NHS using self administered questionnaires, the study concluded that there was a high (84%) probability that the catheters could be cost-effective within NHS hospitals, although this estimate was associated with some uncertainty. Part of the methodological problems related to the length of hospital stay, which appeared to be unbalanced within the study arms; in the majority of circumstances, duration of hospital stay was not related to the presence of the catheter or to CAUTI, but rather to underlying medical conditions or surgical procedures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters versus antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters</HEADING>
<P>Data for this comparison were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>, which compared nitrofurazone (antimicrobial-impregnated) catheters and silver alloy (antiseptic-coated) catheters against standard catheters in a three-armed trial. The results showed that nitrofurazone catheters were superior to silver alloy catheters in reducing both symptomatic CAUTI and bacteriuria. However, up to 50% more patients who received nitrofurazone catheters complained of catheter-related discomfort compared with those who received silver catheters. The potential clinical benefit of nitrofurazone catheters must be balanced against the likelihood that it will cause greater discomfort.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluation</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK> also performed formal economic evaluation of nitrofurazone catheters versus silver alloy catheters. Both catheters were compared with standard catheters, and the results suggested that silver alloy catheters were unlikely to be cost-effective, whilst nitrofurazone catheters could potentially be cost-effective for use in UK NHS hospitals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">One type of standard indwelling urethral catheter versus another type of standard indwelling urethral catheter</HEADING>
<P>This comparison included six trials that randomised a total of 653 hospitalised adults to different types of standard catheters. Three small trials looked at the likelihood of infection between types of standard catheters. There were significant clinical differences between the trials, in terms of: comparison of different types of standard catheters, inclusion of different types of patients and variable outcome measurements. For these reasons, the data from these trials were not pooled. None of the trials, however, provided sufficient evidence to suggest whether any type of standard catheter was superior than another in terms of reducing the rate of bacteriuria.</P>
<P>Another three trials investigated adverse effects of standard catheters, in particular urethral side effects in men. As before, the trials were clinically heterogenous. All the trials included different outcome measures and the catheters compared were diverse. The results indicated that siliconised catheters were less likely to result in adverse urethral effects in men, but each outcome was addressed only in single small trials.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-27 10:01:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of different types of indwelling urethral catheter in reducing the risk of UTI in adults who undergo short-term urethral catheterisation in hospitals. Although 26 RCTs were included, only one trial ((<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>) measured symptomatic CAUTI using standardised definitions. The trial was designed to assess the catheters as they are used within UK NHS hospitals as short-term catheters only. The majority of patients (95%) were patients undergoing elective surgery and were catheterised for perioperative monitoring purposes. As such, the study and review findings have to be interpreted accordingly.</P>
<P>It remains unknown if the effectiveness results regarding the experimental catheters would apply to longer-term catheters, although the trial did not find any interaction between catheter duration and reduction of CAUTI risk. Equally, the impact of the catheters on different groups of patients, for instance those at high risk of developing CAUTIs (i.e. patients in Intensive Therapy Units, patients undergoing urological surgery, or patients with recurrent UTIs) remains uncertain.</P>
<P>In addition, none of the identified trials addressed the following potentially important question:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is one type of antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheter better than another type of antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheter?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Consequently, further trials may be required to address the above uncertainties.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-27 11:07:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We contacted content experts to identify critical outcomes relevant to patients undergoing short-term urethral catheterisation that could be included in this systematic review. Subsequently, we identified five patients who had undergone urethral catheterisation and invited them to take part in a focus group to identify important outcomes from their perspective. The review authors believe that the current work demonstrates the importance of patient involvement when developing Cochrane reviews and for identifying critical outcomes in order to maximise their relevance (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed using GRADE, based on the four critical outcomes identified by this process: symptomatic CAUTI, patient discomfort whilst catheter is in-situ, bacterial resistance towards the antimicrobial agent, and urinary sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was high quality evidence from one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>) that silver alloy (antiseptic-coated) catheters did not significantly reduce symptomatic CAUTI (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16). No trial reported CAUTI for silver oxide (antiseptic-coated) catheters.</P>
<P>There was high quality evidence from the same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pickard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pickard 2012</LINK>) that nitrofurazone-impregnated (antimicrobial-impregnated) catheters achieved a slight but statistically significant reduction in symptomatic CAUTI compared with standard catheters (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99). No trial reported CAUTI for minocycline/rifampicin (antimicrobial-impregnated) catheters.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Are antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters better than standard indwelling urethral catheters?</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that silver alloy (antiseptic-coated) catheters do not reduce symptomatic CAUTI, although they appear to reduce bacteruria, in the short-term catheterised patient. With a few exceptions, the majority of trials dealing with this question were generally of poor quality.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Are antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters better than standard indwelling urethral catheters?</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that antimicrobial-impregnated catheters do reduce symptomatic CAUTI in hospitalised adults catheterised short-term, although the margin of benefit appears to be small. They also reduce bacteriuria to a significant degree. However, they are associated with greater patient-reported discomfort. Whilst these catheters may be cost-effective, it remains unclear if the marginal benefits are clinically important. Some uncertainties also remain over how beneficial the catheters are beyond one week of catheterisation.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Are antimicrobial-impregnated indwelling urethral catheters better than antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheters?</B>
</P>
<P>The data from one well designed study indicated that antimicrobial catheters were more effective in reducing symptomatic CAUTIs than antiseptic-coated catheters, and in reducing bacteriuria, in hospitalised adults catheterised short-term. They were also more likely to be more cost-effective than antiseptic-coated catheters, although they were associated with more patient-reported discomfort.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Is one type of standard indwelling urethral catheter better than another type of standard indwelling urethral catheter?</B>
</P>
<P>No standard catheter was found to be better than another in terms of reducing the risk of bacteriuria in hospitalised adults catheterised short-term. Siliconised catheters may be less likely to cause urethral side effects in men, but this result should be interpreted with some caution as the trials were small and the outcome definitions and specific catheters compared differed.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Is one type of antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheter better than another type of antiseptic-coated indwelling urethral catheter?</B>
<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-27 10:35:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no evidence which supports the use of antiseptic-coated silver alloy-coated catheters in reducing symptomatic CAUTI. There was some evidence which suggested that nitrofurazone (antimicrobial-impregnated) catheters reduced symptomatic CAUTI, but the margin of benefit was small and such catheters were more uncomfortable for patients.</P>
<P>However, the following important questions and issues remain unresolved.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Need for standardised definitions for outcome measures in trials assessing CAUTIs</HEADING>
<P>There is a distinct lack of consensus regarding the choice of outcomes which should be measured in trials, how they should be defined, how they should be measured in terms of the most appropriate measurement tools, time point of outcome measurement, and in their reporting. This leads to difficulty in systematically summarising or pooling the results of different trials, and renders the results of different trials incomparable. Another important knowledge gap is the lack of patient-centred outcomes, such as satisfaction and discomfort/pain, measured in clinical trials. A core outcome set for trials of interventions for reducing symptomatic CAUTI, which encompasses the most important outcomes and which reflect the interests of patients and clinicians, should be developed (<LINK REF="REF-Gargon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gargon 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Valuation of benefit</HEADING>
<P>For the assessment of economic outcomes, there appear to be difficulties in capturing events which accurately reflect the true impact of interventions. For instance, assessment of health-related QoL impact of experimental interventions, such as urethral catheterisation, which represents only a subsidiary part of overall care of patients undergoing more major intervention (e.g. major surgery), is fraught with difficulties, because any impact of the experimental intervention is likely to be masked by the greater impact of the major intervention. More precise and pragmatic methods of capturing any changes in well-being specific to the subsidiary intervention, along with the resultant impact on costs, are needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Further exploration of antimicrobial devices</HEADING>
<P>The exploration of different materials and antimicrobial agents constituting the catheter, or different ways or strategies of inhibiting the formation of catheter biofilms, remains appealing and deserves further research. New catheter materials are being introduced all the time, along with new ways of inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation within the catheter surface, such as the incorporation of drug-eluting materials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Alternative interventions to reduce CAUTI</HEADING>
<P>Whilst much emphasis has been placed on innovative catheter designs (e.g. coating or impregnation with antiseptic or antimicrobial compounds), more pragmatic and intuitive strategies, based on minimising the incidence of catheterisations, shortening catheter duration, and using alternative techniques (e.g. intermittent self catheterisation catheters), warrant further research.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 12:53:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Basically it appears that there is an error in the data tables in that the same numbers appear in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. There is an assumption that a bacteria count of &gt;10<SUP>5</SUP> CFU equates with symptomatic UTI rather than asymptomatic bacteriuria. The reference articles do not distinguish between asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic bacteriuria but call both UTI. They do not look at indications for antibiotic use as these are all hospital patients who often receive antibiotics which could be prophylaxis or for other reasons.</P>
<P>The conclusions on silver catheters preventing symptomatic UTI have been arrived from analysing false data. There is insufficient evidence to claim that silver catheters reduce symptomatic UTI. Similarly it is odd that Maki's abstract is sufficient quality to be included for the UTI analysis but not the asymptomatic bacteriuria as none of these studies adequately distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria.</P>
