<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review compared the effects of single, double and multiple (three or four) injections of local anaesthetic around the nerves in the armpit in providing regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist or forearm surgery in adults.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>A common method of regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist or forearm surgery is to inject local anaesthetic into the tissues surrounding nerves in the armpit. This is because in the armpit (axilla) the key nerves for the lower part of the arm are close together and are easier to locate. This type of anaesthesia is called axillary brachial plexus block. The nerves themselves are located with the needle using various methods including neurostimulation (where an electrical current is passed through the needle to stimulate the nerve and produce muscle movement), the fascial click approach (puncture of the sheath around the nerves), or the transarterial approach (puncture of the artery next to the nerves). Successful blocking of the nerves produces a numb and limp arm that enables pain-free surgery. These nerves may be blocked using single, double or multiple (three or four) injections of local anaesthetic, but it is not clear which technique is preferable.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up until April 2016 and identified 22 randomized controlled trials for inclusion in the review. These trials involved a total of 2193 participants who were given regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. The trials used methods that were generally adequate and did not affect the validity of the findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Nine trials compared double versus single injections. These found that people in the double-injection group had a 45% reduction in their chance of needing additional anaesthesia. The effect was more certain in the four trials where the nerves were located using the more precise method of neurostimulation. In the nine trials comparing multiple with single injections, and the 12 trials comparing multiple with double injections, there were significant reductions in the chance of needing additional anaesthesia in the multiple-injection groups (75% and 73% reductions when compared to single and double injections respectively). In addition, people in the multiple-injection group were 47% less likely to experience pain from the surgical tourniquet compared to the double-injection group. There were no other statistically significant differences in complications or patient discomfort between the two groups for any of the three comparisons. Single and double injections took less time to perform than multiple injections, but this did not reduce the total time required for adequate surgical anaesthesia to be established.</P>
<P>Overall, there is high-quality evidence showing that multiple injections of anaesthetic close to three or four nerves in the armpit provide more complete anaesthesia for hand and forearm surgery than one or two injections. There was, however, not enough evidence to determine if there was a significant difference in the other outcomes, including safety.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regional anaesthesia comprising axillary block of the brachial plexus is a common anaesthetic technique for distal upper limb surgery. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2011 and 2013.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-03-27 15:17:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of three injection techniques (single, double and multiple) of axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper extremity surgery. We considered these effects primarily in terms of anaesthetic effectiveness; the complication rate (neurological and vascular); and pain and discomfort caused by performance of the block.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-31 12:44:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to April Week 1 2016), Embase (1947 to April 18 2016) and reference lists of trials. We contacted trial authors. The date of the last search was April 2016 (updated from March 2013).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-28 23:11:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials that compared double with single-injection techniques, multiple with single-injection techniques, or multiple with double-injection techniques for axillary block in adults undergoing surgery of the distal upper limb.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Independent study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two investigators. We undertook meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included one new trial involving 45 participants in this updated review. In total we included 22 trials involving a total of 2193 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. 'Risk of bias' assessment indicated that trial design and conduct were generally adequate; the most common areas of weakness were in blinding and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Nine trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.89, high-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve location showed that the effect size was greater when neurostimulation was used rather than the transarterial technique.</P>
<P>Nine trials comparing multiple with single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.42, high-quality evidence). Pooled data from five trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96, high-quality evidence) in the multiple-injection group.</P>
<P>Twelve trials comparing multiple versus double injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.39, high-quality evidence). Pooled data from six trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85, high-quality evidence) in the multiple injection group.</P>
<P>Tourniquet pain was significantly reduced with multiple injections compared with double injections (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, high-quality evidence). Otherwise there were no statistically significant differences between groups in any of the three comparisons on secondary analgesia failure, complications and patient discomfort. Compared with multiple injections, the time for block performance was significantly shorter for single injection (MD 3.33 minutes, 95% CI 2.76 to 3.90) and double injections (MD 1.54 minutes, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.29); however there was no difference in time to readiness for surgery.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An increase in the use of ambulatory hand surgery has generated the need for a method of regional anaesthesia that is comparable to general anaesthesia. Most anaesthesiologists agree that the regional technique has to satisfy four criteria for inclusion in their clinical practice. It should be effective, fast, safe and cause the patient either no, or only minimal, pain.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three main nerves of the upper extremity (median, ulnar and radial) are enclosed in the axilla by the fascial neurovascular sheath. This limits the spread of fluid. <LINK REF="REF-Burnham-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnham 1958</LINK> discovered that filling this sheath with local anaesthetic could simplify the blocking procedure to a single axillary injection. The fourth main nerve of the upper extremity, the musculocutaneous nerve, usually leaves the brachial plexus more proximally, at the cord level in the infraclavicular area. <LINK REF="REF-De-Jong-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jong 1961</LINK>, using the mathematical formula for a cylinder and assuming equal proximal and distal spread from the injection site, calculated that 42 ml of local anaesthetic was sufficient to reach this area and thus anaesthetize the whole arm in the average adult. Thompson and Rorie were the first to show (by computed tomograms) that the median, ulnar and radial nerves lie in separate fascial compartments within the neurovascular sheath (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1983</LINK>). Small septae divide the neurovascular sheath and limit the circumferential spread of local anaesthetic. This provided a rational explanation for incomplete blocks. The anatomical study by Lassale and Ang, based on plaster injection into the axillary perivascular space, did not confirm the existence of a true neurovascular sheath (<LINK REF="REF-Lassale-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassale 1984</LINK>). In a similar study, Vester-Andersen et al did not find the fascial septae separating the nerves but noticed that in all dissections only the median and ulnar nerves were engulfed by injected gelatine (<LINK REF="REF-Vester_x002d_Andersen-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vester-Andersen 1986a</LINK>). The musculocutaneous and radial nerves had either a partial contact or none at all. Partridge et al found interneural septae that were easily broken by injection of dyed latex (<LINK REF="REF-Partridge-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 1987</LINK>). They therefore concluded that the septae did not limit fluid spread and had no clinical significance for anaesthesia. All these reports were based on either personal experience in a small number of patients or on cadaver studies, and none of them were controlled.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Before the 1960s, the prevalent block techniques were double or multiple axillary injections. After De Jong's report in 1961, the single-injection technique, being the simplest, became standard. Entry into the fascial neurovascular sheath was signalled either by a fascial 'click' or elicitation of paraesthesiae in the arm. The proximal spread of local anaesthetic was considered mandatory for success. The incomplete blocks were explained by insufficient volume of local anaesthetic. In the 1980s, however, Vester-Andersen et al repeatedly showed that, in spite of increased local anaesthetic volumes or concentrations, the rate of incomplete axillary blocks was high (<LINK REF="REF-Vester_x002d_Andersen-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vester-Andersen 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vester_x002d_Andersen-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vester-Andersen 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vester_x002d_Andersen-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vester-Andersen 1986a</LINK>). In the early 1990s, the double-injection transarterial technique using high doses of local anaesthetic gained popularity in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Stan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urban-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urban 1994</LINK>). In this technique, transfixion of the axillary artery was deliberately achieved to confirm entry into the neurovascular sheath; local anaesthetic was then injected behind (posterior to) as well as in front of (anterior to) the artery, in anticipation that this would increase the chance of spread to all components of the plexus.</P>
<P>At approximately the same time, technical development of peripheral nerve stimulators and insulated blunt needles allowed electrolocation of the individual plexus nerves. While electrolocation (also known as neurostimulation) may be applied to single and double-injection techniques, its greatest advantage is that it allows targeted injection around three or more of the main nerves to the arm. This is known as the multiple-injection technique. Lavoie et al and Koscielniak-Nielsen et al reported that this technique was superior to the single-injection method (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Nielsen-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Nielsen 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavoie-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavoie 1992a</LINK>), and Koscielniak-Nielsen et al reported its superiority over the transarterial technique (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Nielsen-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Nielsen 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Nielsen-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Nielsen 1999c</LINK>). Coventry et al and Sia et al drew similar conclusions when comparing triple injection with double injection (<LINK REF="REF-Coventry-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coventry 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sia-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sia 2001a</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first version of our review reported that no recommendations were available as to which of these techniques (single, double or multiple injection) were preferable, and that the choice is left to the personal preferences of the anaesthesiologist (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2006</LINK>). The findings of the systematic review were in favour of multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block in terms of providing more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques. It emphasized, however, that there was insufficient evidence for other outcomes, especially longer-term outcomes and safety.</P>
<P>We updated this review in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2011</LINK>), with data from eight newly identified studies, and again in 2013 with data from one additional study (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2013</LINK>), and confirmed our previous findings. In 2011 we also clarified the scope of this review. We explicitly excluded ultrasound-guided axillary block techniques as these are clinically very different from the landmark and neurostimulation-guided techniques described above. Our review noted that ultrasound-guided axillary block was "a multiple injection technique where each of the four individual nerves are identified and targeted under direct vision" (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2011</LINK>). While there has been investigation since then comparing single, double and multiple-injection ultrasound-guided techniques of axillary block (<LINK REF="STD-Bernucci-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bernucci 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huynh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Huynh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tran-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 2012</LINK>), this remains a separate question from that addressed in this review.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that scientific research into peripheral nerve blockade is now focused primarily on ultrasound-guided techniques, this review remains clinically relevant as there are areas in the world, particularly developing countries, where ultrasound technology is not readily available to anaesthesia practitioners. This updated review therefore sought to determine which of the non-ultrasound guided techniques (single, double or multiple injection) are preferable in performing axillary block of the brachial plexus.</P>

We resolved any differences by discussion via email correspondence. We contacted trial authors for further details of their trials.</P>
<P>In the first version of the review, because ZK-N was the lead investigator of four included trials, the other review authors undertook independent data entry into Review Manager (RevMan 4.2) and performed the presentation and interpretation of these four trials.

<P>For the first version of the review, two people independently assessed adequacy of study design using an adaptation of the eight-item scoring scheme (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) formerly developed by ACE. We assessed the following items: allocation concealment; description of study inclusion and exclusion criteria; intention-to-treat analysis (description of withdrawals); description of baseline characteristics of the trial population (in particular age, sex, mental status and type of surgery); comparability of care programmes other than the trial interventions (including anaesthetist experience with technique); outcome assessor blinding; and timing of outcome measurement (minimum 24 hours). As ZK-N was the lead investigator of four of the included trials in the first version of the review, these trials were reviewed independently of him. We resolved any differences by discussion.</P>
<P>In subsequent versions of the review, as well as this update, we assessed risk of bias using the tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomization (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of the outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered all outcomes in our assessment of blinding and completeness of outcome data. We assessed two additional sources of bias: selection bias resulting from major imbalances in key baseline characteristics (age, sex, type of surgery, mental status); and performance bias, such as that resulting from a lack of comparability in the experience of the anaesthetist with the interventions being compared.</P>
<P>In the second version of the review, one author (HH) assessed risk of bias of the already included trials, drawing on the previous assessments. Both authors independently assessed the newly included trials. We resolved any differences by discussion.</P>

<P>The risk of bias judgements on seven items for the individual trials are summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, and described in the 'Risk of bias' tables in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We judged items as having a low, high or 'unclear' risk of bias. An 'unclear' verdict often reflected a lack of information upon which to judge the item. Successful contact with trial investigators usually resulted in an improved assessment of one or more items. We always took lack of information on blinding, primarily assessor blinding, to imply that there was no blinding and rated this as high risk of bias. We gave a high risk of bias rating for single items in six trials; this related to a lack of assessor blinding in four of these. We gave a high risk of bias for two items in <LINK REF="STD-Ramirez_x002d_Gomez-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ramirez-Gomez 2010</LINK>.</P>

<P>There was a general lack of detail on the method of randomization and measures taken to conceal treatment allocation in the included trials. We judged only five trials at low risk of bias, resulting from adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Kjelstrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kjelstrup 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1999b</LINK>). We judged allocation as concealed in <LINK REF="STD-Coventry-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coventry 2001</LINK> but there were insufficient details on the shuffling of the envelopes to confirm the generation of an adequate randomization sequence. The use of an open randomization list by <LINK REF="STD-Serradell-Catalan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Serradell Catalan 2001</LINK> meant that we judged this trial at high risk of selection bias.</P>

<P>The short follow-up in most of these trials prevented loss of follow-up for the primary outcome being a serious issue and we judged that all trials performed intention-to-treat analysis in that there was no cross-over.

<P>We judged risk of bias resulting from major imbalances in baseline characteristics as low in five trials and 'unclear' in the remainder. Generally the lack of information on the distribution in the types of surgery undertaken (and implicated nerves) in the intervention groups was the reason for uncertainty. We judged the risk of performance bias, primarily based on an assessment of reported operator experience and comparability of this between intervention groups, as low in 11 trials and 'unclear' in the rest. While we also based our judgement on an interpretation of individual trial procedures, we did not think the lack of reporting by trials on comparability of care programmes impacted on trial validity.</P>

<P>The ideal regional anaesthetic technique should meet four criteria: it should be effective, fast, safe and cause the patient little or no pain. All 22 included trials reported on and provided high-quality evidence for differences in anaesthetic effectiveness (primary anaesthesia) between single, double or multiple-injection techniques of axillary brachial plexus blocks. However, the reporting of timing (block performance time, onset time, time to readiness for surgery), safety (early and late complications), and pain during block performance was less complete and the quality of evidence therefore ranged from low to moderate due mainly to imprecision as well as some inconsistency in direction of effect. Though the latter three criteria are described as secondary outcomes in this review, they are as important as the primary outcome of anaesthetic effectiveness when considering the choice of anaesthetic technique. We summarize the findings of the three comparisons in turn and then provide some overall comments.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Double versus single-injection technique</HEADING>
<P>We found high-quality evidence from nine studies in 527 participants for a reduced risk of primary anaesthesia failure in the double-injection group compared to the single-injection group (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.89). This was true regardless of whether failure was defined as incomplete sensory block of all nerves or incomplete anaesthesia of the surgical site. However, when we subgrouped the data according to the technique used for double injection, double injections were significantly more effective than single injections only when neurostimulation was used in both intervention groups, and not when the transarterial technique was used. It should be noted that in the original review a test of interaction showed the results of these two subgroups to be significantly different from each other. This was not the case in the updated review (based on random-effects model risk ratios) and, given that the method of nerve location by itself does not explain the heterogeneity within the two subgroups, we have therefore pooled the data and reported the summary statistic for all trials. There were no statistically significant differences between the double and single-injection groups in the other reported outcomes (incomplete motor block, secondary analgesia failure, timings, complications and patient discomfort).</P>

Pooled data from four trials also showed a statistically significant decrease in incomplete motor block in the multiple-injection group. It took 3.3 minutes longer on average to perform the block in the multiple-injection group. Although this difference is clinically significant, it is unclear if this has any impact on the time to readiness for surgery as only two trials reported this outcome and had conflicting results. There were no statistically significant overall differences in the other reported outcomes (secondary analgesia failure, other timings, complications and patient discomfort). In one study there was a statistically significant excess of paraesthesia and tachycardia and two serious episodes of local anaesthetic toxicity in the single-injection group, which can be attributed to the transarterial technique used (<LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1999b</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Multiple versus double-injection technique</HEADING>

In particular, it was irrespective of whether the double injections involved the transarterial injection technique or neurostimulation. Incomplete motor block and tourniquet pain were also significantly less likely in the multiple-injection group compared to the double-injection group. It took 1.7 minutes longer on average to perform the block in the multiple-injection group which, although statistically significant, is not clinically important. This was supported by the pooled data from five trials showing no overall difference in the time to readiness for surgery. There were no other statistically significant differences between the multiple and double-injection groups in the pooled results of other reported outcomes (secondary analgesia failure, other timings, complications and patient discomfort). The more frequent occurrence of tachycardia (resulting from intravascular injections) and axillary haematoma when the results of <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-K_x002d_Nielsen-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">K-Nielsen 1999a</LINK> were pooled are likely to reflect the method of double injection used (transarterial without neurostimulation) in these trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overview</HEADING>
<P>The results of this update confirm the original review&#8217;s conclusion that a multiple-injection technique (using neurostimulation) of non-ultrasound guided axillary block provides more effective anaesthesia than either a double or a single-injection technique. The question of whether three or four injections should be performed, or which nerves should be targeted in the multiple-injection technique, is not addressed in this review. The multiple-injection technique also appears to have other advantages, including more complete motor block and a reduced risk of tourniquet pain. Its primary disadvantage is that locating and injecting around three or more nerves in the axillary brachial plexus is much more complex, as reflected in the longer time required for performance of the multiple-injection technique compared to the single and double-injection techniques. Interestingly, this did not appear to significantly increase the time to readiness for surgery, although this is not necessarily conclusive given the limited data. The most likely explanation is that the increased anaesthetic efficacy of the multiple-injection technique offsets the longer block performance time.</P>
<P>The method of nerve location used in the single or double-injection techniques appears to influence the effectiveness and safety of anaesthesia. Double injections are more effective than single injections when neurostimulation is used in both interventions, but not when double injection is performed using the transarterial method and single injection is performed using neurostimulation. There was also some evidence of a greater risk of short-term complications related to vascular puncture, such as intravascular injection and axillary haematoma, when the transarterial method was used. Taken together, this suggests that neurostimulation should be the method of choice when performing a double-injection axillary block.</P>
<P>While there were no significant differences observed in many of the other outcomes related to secondary anaesthesia, complications, and patient pain and discomfort, this cannot be regarded as conclusive due to the limited data and thus low quality of available evidence. In particular, the safety of multiple-injection methods remains an important unresolved issue given the low complication event rates reported in this review. The inevitable increase in needle passes while searching for other nerves after the first or second injection carries an increased risk of vascular puncture and trauma to nerves that is difficult to quantify. However, one large, multicentre prospective study of multiple-injection techniques for upper and lower limb blockade found generally reassuring evidence for axillary brachial plexus block (<LINK REF="REF-Fanelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanelli 1999</LINK>). Although 17% (278/1650) of these multiple-injection axillary blocks elicited unintentional paraesthesiae prompting needle withdrawal, all 17 (1%) people sustaining transient neurological dysfunction recovered fully at an average of six weeks. The same study also found some evidence that neurological dysfunction was associated with high tourniquet pressure rather than multiple injections (<LINK REF="REF-Fanelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanelli 1999</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-31 01:44:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update we identified and included one new trial, bringing the total to 22 trials. There are almost 2200 participants in the updated review, although the numbers of participants for each of the three comparisons are fewer and range from 527 to 966. The distinction between no evidence of an effect and evidence of no effect still needs to be considered where there are apparently comparable findings as data were limited for many of these outcomes. Application of trial results to clinical practice is hampered where there is an inadequate description of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria (six trials) and the types of surgery undertaken (10 trials). Another common shortcoming (10 trials) was the failure to monitor longer-term effects, particularly adverse effects.</P>

<P>The risk of bias varied in the 22 trials but the included trials were generally well conducted and either at low or unclear risk of bias for the seven aspects rated in our assessment (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). We rated only seven trials at high risk of bias and this in one domain only (mainly lack of blinding) for six of the seven trials. We rated the quality of evidence underlying the primary outcome of primary analgesic or anaesthetic failure as high. We downgraded the quality of evidence to low or moderate for several of the secondary outcomes, particularly the risk of complications such as intravascular injection and longer-term adverse effects, due mainly to imprecision and inconsistency (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We may have missed trials that are not indexed in MEDLINE or Embase. In particular, we may have missed trials that remain unpublished in journals by not searching conference proceedings and other 'grey literature'. We did, however, approach trialists and contacts in the industry for information on existing trials. While the possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out, we consider that a well-conducted trial on this topic would have stood a good chance of being published in specialist journals irrespective of its results. Our trial selection procedure was systematic and, after an initial filtering of the results from the electronic searches, each author carried out independent selection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pooling and heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We chose to pool data from trials testing the same comparisons; however, no two trials were identical. There were notable differences in the interventions, such as in the method of location of nerves and selection of specific nerves (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), study populations and definitions of outcomes (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). We performed subgroup analyses of the outcome of primary anaesthesia failure according to the method of nerve location and the definition of adequate sensory blockade; however, the data were insufficient to examine the effects of the other methodological differences.</P>

<P>This review provides high-quality evidence that multiple-injection techniques using neurostimulation for axillary brachial plexus block provide more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of single, double and multiple-injection techniques on the complication rate, secondary analgesia failure, patient discomfort and pain during the procedure.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-25 17:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the second version of the review was published, the use of ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blockade has become widespread and has largely supplanted neurostimulation techniques, particularly in developed countries with access to the technology. Hence while the maintenance of this review in the light of any new evidence from randomized trials is required, we do not consider that conducting further randomized trials on this subject is a priority. We however suggest that the systematic surveillance of people undergoing these injections to ascertain the incidence of rare adverse effects, in particular serious and permanent neurological injuries, should be ongoing.</P>
