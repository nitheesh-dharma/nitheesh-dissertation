<TITLE>Ovarian suppression with LHRH agonists (such as goserelin) for treating premenopausal women with early breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:08:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More than half of the premenopausal women who develop breast cancer have a type of cancer that is sensitive to hormones, termed 'oestrogen receptor positive' or ER+ disease. To slow the growth of any cancer cells that remain after surgery, hormonal therapy can be used to reduce the availability of the natural hormone oestrogen to the cells. This can be done by blocking the oestrogen receptors on the cells with drugs such as tamoxifen, by suppressing the production of oestrogen by drugs called luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, or by removing the ovaries with surgery or impairing their ability to produce hormones using radiotherapy. A new class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors work by stopping the production of oestrogen, but can only be safely used in premenopausal women if their ovarian cycling is suppressed (either by LHRH agonists, surgery, or radiotherapy). Chemotherapy, designed to kill cancer cells, can also have a hormonal action by bringing on early menopause. This review examined the role of LHRH agonists for women with early stage breast cancer. It looked at comparisons of LHRH agonists versus other types of hormonal treatment and versus chemotherapy. We also examined the role of combined LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen therapy, combined LHRH agonist plus chemotherapy, and combined LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen plus chemotherapy. A total of 14 randomised trials that involved over 13,000 women were found, but only a small number of these were relevant to each of the comparisons in this review. The LHRH agonist in the trials was usually goserelin, used for a couple of years.</P>
<P>We found seven trials comparing LHRH agonist therapy (alone) to other treatments. There is not enough evidence to compare LHRH agonists directly to tamoxifen. Four of the trials compared an LHRH agonist to a now superseded chemotherapy regimen. For ER+ women, these trials showed no significant differences between LHRH agonists and chemotherapy on recurrence and death, but LHRH agonists had fewer side effects.</P>
<P>Six trials compared LHRH agonists in combination with tamoxifen to other treatments. There is currently insufficient information to reliably compare this combination with tamoxifen alone. The LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen combination may reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, but not death, when compared to an LHRH agonist alone or chemotherapy alone. There is insufficient evidence to know whether an LHRH agonist plus an aromatase inhibitor is better or worse than an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen.</P>
<P>Three trials compared combining an LHRH agonist plus chemotherapy plus tamoxifen to chemotherapy alone. There was a reduction in the risk of breast cancer recurrence, and possibly death, with the combination treatment.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the current standard of care for premenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer is five years of tamoxifen, often with chemotherapy. We found no trials of LHRH agonist-containing regimens versus this standard. The women in the trials in this review need to continue to be followed up so that the longer-term effects can be investigated, to 10 and more years after diagnosis. More research is also needed to help choose between different types of LHRH agonist, and to find out if the length of time that the drug is used makes a difference. It is also unknown whether there are important differences between the effects of LHRH agonists and ovarian ablation by surgery or radiotherapy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-03 13:50:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 60% of breast cancers amongst premenopausal women express the nuclear oestrogen receptor (ER+ breast cancer). Adjuvant endocrine therapy is an integral component of care for ER+ breast cancer, exerting its effect by reducing the availability of oestrogen to micrometastatic tumour cells. Endocrine strategies in premenopausal women include oestrogen receptor blockade with tamoxifen, temporary suppression of ovarian oestrogen synthesis by luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, or permanent interruption of ovarian oestrogen synthesis with oophorectomy or radiotherapy. Aromatase inhibitors are also available with concurrent suppression of ovarian oestrogen synthesis, either through LHRH agonists, surgery, or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy can also have an endocrine action in premenopausal women by interrupting ovarian oestrogen production, either temporarily or permanently. International consensus statements recommend single agent tamoxifen as the current standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women (often preceded by chemotherapy), and the role of LHRH agonists remains under active investigation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 11:53:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register was searched on 19 February 2009. This register incorporates references from CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>) (to 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (until 2002); and handsearches of abstracts from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, and the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia Annual Meeting. MEDLINE references (from August 2008 to 19th February 2009) were checked by the authors. The reference lists of related reviews were checked. A final check of the list of trials maintained by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group was made in January 2008.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:01:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 14 randomised trials that involved over 13,000 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer, most of whom were ER+. The numbers of trials making the different comparisons were:</P>
<P>(A) i. LHRH versus tamoxifen (three trials),</P>
<P>ii. LHRH versus chemotherapy (four trials);</P>
<P>(B) i. LHRH + tamoxifen versus tamoxifen (two trials),</P>

<P>ii. LHRH + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (five trials);</P>
<P>(D) LHRH + tamoxifen + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (three trials).</P>
<P>The LHRH agonist in most of these trials was goserelin.</P>
<P>For most of the treatment comparisons there are too few trials, too few randomised patients, or too little follow up to draw reliable estimates of the relative effects of different treatments.</P>
<P>(A) <I>LHRH monotherapy</I>: results suggest that adjuvant LHRH agonist monotherapy is similar to older chemotherapy protocols (eg. CMF) in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival in ER+ patients. There are insufficient data to compare LHRH agonist monotherapy to tamoxifen alone, but available results suggest that these treatments are comparable in terms of recurrence-free survival.</P>
<P>(B) <I>LHRH + anti-oestrogen therapy</I>: there are insufficient data to compare the combination of an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen to tamoxifen alone. Results suggest that the LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen combination may be superior to an LHRH agonist alone or to chemotherapy alone, but the chemotherapy protocols tested are outdated. The data comparing LHRH agonists plus aromatase inhibitors to LHRH agonists plus tamoxifen are currently inconclusive.</P>
<P>(C) <I>LHRH + chemotherapy</I>: there are insufficient data to compare the LHRH + chemotherapy combination to an LHRH agonist alone, although results from a single study suggest comparable efficacy in ER+ patients. There is a trend towards improved recurrence-free and overall survival in patients who received an LHRH agonist plus chemotherapy combination in comparison to chemotherapy alone.</P>
<P>(D) <I>LHRH agonist + chemotherapy + tamoxifen</I>: there is a trend towards improved recurrence-free and overall survival in patients who received an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to chemotherapy alone.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data to assess the effect of the addition of LHRH agonists to the current standard treatment of chemotherapy plus tamoxifen.</P>
<P>Endocrine therapy with LHRH agonists appears to have fewer side-effects than the forms of chemotherapy assessed. The optimal duration of LHRH therapy in the adjuvant setting is unclear.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:02:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the data from currently published clinical trials of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant setting for premenopausal women with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer are supportive of clinical benefit. Nonetheless, definitive comparisons against current clinical standards of care that include third generation chemotherapy regimens and tamoxifen are required before their place in the adjuvant setting can be properly defined. The authors conclude that the current data strongly support the continuation of current trials that definitively compare a variety of combinations of LHRH agonists and anti-oestrogenic strategies to the current standard of five years of tamoxifen.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-06 11:17:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 20% of women diagnosed and treated for early breast cancer will eventually die of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>). The aim of adjuvant therapy is to prevent recurrence and improve overall survival. In premenopausal women with early breast cancer the options for adjuvant therapy include cytotoxic chemotherapy; anti-oestrogen therapy; and ovarian ablation, either irreversibly with surgery or radiotherapy, or reversibly with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Gelber-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelber 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Approximately 60% of tumours in premenopausal women are hormone sensitive and these patients may be suitable for hormonal treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Pujol-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pujol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>). The goal of hormonal therapy is to reduce the availability of oestrogen to the cancer cells. This can be achieved by blocking oestrogen receptors with drugs such as tamoxifen, suppression of oestrogen synthesis by LHRH agonists, or ovarian ablation either surgically or by radiotherapy. Aromatase inhibitors (used in postmenopausal women with no ovarian oestrogen synthesis) prevent the synthesis of oestrogen from androgens, and can be used safely in premenopausal patients if there is concurrent suppression of ovarian oestrogen synthesis (by LHRH agonists, or through surgery or radiotherapy) (<LINK REF="REF-Forward-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forward 2004</LINK>). Chemotherapy has been shown to induce amenorrhoea in 60% to 80% of premenopausal women who receive adjuvant treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bines-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bines 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walshe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 2006</LINK>). It is clear that, particularly in the case of hormone sensitive disease, patients who become amenorrhoeic following chemotherapy have a better disease-free survival than those who do not (<LINK REF="REF-Pagani-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagani 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walshe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 2006</LINK>). This suggests that at least some of the beneficial effect of chemotherapy in premenopausal women is mediated via its toxic effect on the ovaries, resulting in ovarian ablation or suppression. The value of ovarian ablation by either oophorectomy or radiotherapy is clearly demonstrated by a meta-analysis from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>), which focused on women under the age of 50 years, most of whom were likely to be premenopausal. For women who underwent ovarian ablation in the absence of chemotherapy there was a 25% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence and a 24% reduction in the annual odds of death. The benefit was seen in both node-positive and node-negative women. In women randomised to ovarian ablation following chemotherapy the benefit of ablation appeared smaller and was not statistically significant (reduction in the annual odds of recurrence was 10% with a standard error (SE) of 9%; reduction in the annual odds of death was 8%, SE 10%). These results were further supported by two other trials, which compared adjuvant ovarian ablation to chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) (<LINK REF="REF-SCTBG-and-ICRF-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCTBG and ICRF 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ejlertsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejlertsen 1999</LINK>). Both these trials concluded that chemotherapy and oophorectomy have similar effects on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for premenopausal women with node-positive disease. However, a retrospective subanalysis of the Scottish/ICRF trial suggested that oophorectomy had a survival benefit over chemotherapy in those women whose tumours were ER positive, whereas oral CMF had a benefit over oophorectomy in women with ER negative tumours (<LINK REF="REF-SCTBG-and-ICRF-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCTBG and ICRF 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>LHRH agonists provide effective ovarian suppression in premenopausal women and are an effective alternative to oophorectomy or pelvic radiotherapy. These agents induce a menopausal status that is usually reversible on cessation of therapy. LHRH agonists act by binding to pituitary LHRH receptors, resulting in down regulation of receptors and subsequent suppression of luteinising hormone and oestradiol (<LINK REF="REF-Furr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furr 1989</LINK>). The most commonly prescribed LHRH agonist is goserelin. The major side effects of these drugs are fertility impairment, decreased libido, hot flushes, sweating, headache, blood pressure changes, loss of bone density, transient increased pain in bony metastases, hypercalcaemia, and a number of other rare complications. A number of clinical trials have shown goserelin to be effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in premenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Klijn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 2001</LINK>), with a response similar to that seen with surgical oophorectomy or ovarian suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1998</LINK>). The aim of this review is to clarify the effect of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant treatment of ER positive breast cancer in premenopausal women, by performing a systematic review of the available randomised trials. An earlier version of this review has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2005</LINK>); a number of the trials have since been reported in full, and a new trial has been reported.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register was searched (most recently on 19 February 2009). The search strategy applied by the Group to create the register and the procedure used to code references, are described in the Group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Studies coded as "early breast cancer" and "endocrine therapy" on the specialised register were extracted for consideration. In addition, the reference lists of related reviews were checked. The list of trials maintained by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group was checked (most recently in January 2008). Furthermore, the proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (2005 to 2008) were handsearched. A copy of the full article for each reference reporting a potentially eligible trial was obtained.</P>

<P>Results of included studies have not been combined in a meta-analysis because this was not judged appropriate or possible at this time. The aim for all analyses was to use the intention-to-treat principle, which would be dependent upon the quality of the trial reporting. Our aim was to perform time-to-event analyses using the time to death (censoring at last known follow up) and time to first recurrence, and to combine the time-to-event data to obtain a pooled hazard rate (HR) using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). However, because of the limited amount of data available we chose instead to present the results of the included studies in accordance with how they had been published, using the maximum amount of information available. A future update of this review, when the included and ongoing studies are sufficiently mature, should allow for a more robust analysis.</P>
<P>Our analyses rely on the summary data reported for each trial, which are dependent upon the trialists' definitions of outcomes and the detail in their reports. For this version of this review we have not extracted data from published survival curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our protocol, we wrote that decisions regarding the combination of quality of life outcomes would be made depending on the availability of this information from the included studies. The information available on these outcomes varied so widely among the trials that meta-analyses were not done but where information was available this is described for each trial in the Results section below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">A. LHRH agonists (experimental arm) versus other treatments</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials were identified that addressed the comparison of LHRH agonists (as an experimental treatment) to another treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Three trials addressed the effects of an LHRH agonist compared to tamoxifen (<LINK REF="STD-Soreide-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soreide 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>) in a total of approximately 1400 women. In each of these trials, the LHRH agonist was goserelin given as a 3.6 mg depot every 28 days for two years. Tamoxifen was given at 20 mg per day orally for two years in these trials (40mg for some patients in the <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK> trial). Another four trials (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_A_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-A-93</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TABLE" TYPE="STUDY">TABLE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZEBRA" TYPE="STUDY">ZEBRA</LINK>) addressed the effects of an LHRH agonist compared to chemotherapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">i. LHRH agonist versus tamoxifen</HEADING>
<P>The largest of the trials assessing the integration of LHRH agonists into hormonal therapy was the ZIPP trial (<LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). This was an international collaboration between four breast cancer research groups who adopted similar protocols with the intention of combining their results in a meta-analysis. The trial used a 2 x 2 factorial design. The main randomisation was goserelin versus control (all 2710 patients) and a second randomisation of tamoxifen versus control was done for 1800 women. A further 860 women in the randomisation of goserelin versus no goserelin were given tamoxifen electively. Only 68% of the 2032 patients with known ER status in the ZIPP trial were ER+. The ZIPP results have not been reported separately for patients who underwent both randomisations (apart from in relation to major reported side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2006</LINK>)). The reporting of recurrence and survival data for these women would provide a direct comparison of goserelin (444 patients) versus tamoxifen (448). The proportion of patients who experienced at least one side effect was 56% among patients allocated goserelin alone and 41% among patients receiving tamoxifen alone. The most common side effect was hot flushes (26% versus 17%). The only other side effect reported by more than 10 patients in either group was weight gain (4% versus 7%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other two trials identified, the Soreide trial and the Zoladex Breast Cancer Study Group trial from Japan, have reported the direct randomised comparison of goserelin versus tamoxifen, but in much smaller numbers of patients. The Soreide trial randomised 320 premenopausal patients who were not known to be ER- to goserelin versus tamoxifen. After a median follow up of 88 months, patients randomised to goserelin were not statistically different to those allocated to tamoxifen in their risk of recurrence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.48, P = 0.56) or death (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.69, P = 0.42) (<LINK REF="STD-Soreide-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soreide 2002</LINK>). In the Japanese trial, 187 patients were randomised to goserelin versus tamoxifen. There was no statistically significant difference for patients allocated goserelin in recurrence-free survival (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.63) or overall survival (HR 2.10, 95% CI 0.38 to 11.49), for which there were only four deaths (<LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii. LHRH agonist versus chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were identified that compared an LHRH agonist versus chemotherapy, including a total of more than 3000 women. All four trials used CMF: three as six cycles each of 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TABLE" TYPE="STUDY">TABLE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZEBRA" TYPE="STUDY">ZEBRA</LINK>) and one using three cycles (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_A_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-A-93</LINK>). Two trials used classical CMF with cyclophosphamide given orally on each of the first 14 days of the cycle (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TABLE" TYPE="STUDY">TABLE</LINK>). The ZEBRA trial allowed either classical CMF with oral cyclophosphamide or CMF with intravenous cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-ZEBRA" TYPE="STUDY">ZEBRA</LINK>). The GABG trial used intravenous cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_A_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-A-93</LINK>). There was also variability in the hormonal therapy used in these three trials. Goserelin (3.6 mg depot every 28 days) was used in IBCSG VIII, for two years in the absence of chemotherapy or for 18 months when following six months of chemotherapy. It was used for two years in the GABG and ZEBRA trials. In the TABLE trial, the LHRH agonist was leuprorelin acetate (11.5 mg every 3 months) for two years.</P>
<P>The largest of these four trials was the ZEBRA trial, in which three quarters of the women were ER+ (1189 of 1614, 73.7%), 304 (18.8%) were ER-, and 121 (7.5%) had unknown ER status (<LINK REF="STD-ZEBRA" TYPE="STUDY">ZEBRA</LINK>). Overall, with a median follow up of 87 months, patients randomised to goserelin had significantly worse recurrence-free survival (49.8%) than those allocated to chemotherapy (56.2%) (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.40, P = 0.007), and a non-significantly worse overall survival (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.39, P = 0.14). However, a highly significant interaction was found between treatment and ER status (P = 0.0016) for recurrence-free survival. Patients who were ER+ had similar recurrence-free survival and overall survival in both treatment groups (HR for recurrence-free survival for goserelin versus CMF 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.24, P = 0.60; HR for overall survival 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.18, P = 0.62) with the worse outcome for goserelin-treated patients being due to the effect in the ER- patients (HR for recurrence-free survival 1.64, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.39, P = 0.0009; HR for overall survival 1.83, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.52, P = 0.001) and ER-unknown patients (HR for recurrence-free survival 2.00, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.75, P = 0.026; HR for overall survival 1.81, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.05, P = 0.14). After six months of treatment in ZEBRA, amenorrhoea was more common in patients treated with goserelin (95%) than with chemotherapy (59%). However, after three years, 23% of patients who had received goserelin remained amenorrhoeic compared with 77% of patients treated with chemotherapy. The incidence of adverse reactions, including menopausal side effects, hot flushes, vaginal discharge and vaginal soreness, was similar in both groups (in total, goserelin: 42.6%; chemotherapy: 48.0%). These side effects tended to resolve within a year after stopping goserelin but persisted in the chemotherapy group for the 30 months under investigation. A special assessment of quality of life was done in 86 of the 102 centres, involving 1010 of the randomised patients. Early benefits were noted during months three to six of treatment for women in the goserelin group. However, at one, two, and three years there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The IBCSG VIII trial randomised just over 1000 patients to CMF alone versus CMF followed by goserelin versus goserelin alone (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>). A fourth option of no adjuvant therapy was closed two years into the trial, when a total of 205 patients had been randomised to the trial as a whole. Two thirds of the women in the trial were ER+ (720 of 1111, 68%); 315 (30%) were ER-; and 28 (3%) had unknown ER status. Overall, with a median follow up of 84 months, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in disease-free survival or overall survival. The five-year disease-free survival was 79% (95% CI 75% to 84%) for goserelin alone and 82% (95% CI 78% to 86%) for chemotherapy alone. In the comparison of goserelin versus chemotherapy, the relative risk for disease free survival was 1.13 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.53, P = 0.44). However, an interaction was found between treatment and ER status. ER+ patients in both the goserelin group and the chemotherapy group had similar disease-free survival (5-year DFS 81%, 95% CI 76% to 87% in both groups; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42, P = 0.86). In contrast, ER- patients had worse disease-free recurrence in the goserelin group (73%, 95% CI 64% to 81%) compared to the chemotherapy group (84%, 95% CI 77% to 91%) (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.58, P = 0.12). Toxicities of grade 3 or worse were experienced by 4.7% of patients allocated to goserelin alone (mostly weight gain) and by 18.8% of patients during chemotherapy (mostly leucopenia, neutropenia, and nausea or vomiting).</P>
<P>In younger women under the age of 40 years receiving chemotherapy, amenorrhoea occurred later, being observed in 50% of these patients by the end of six cycles of CMF. In women who received goserelin after chemotherapy, 90% became amenorrhoeic a few months after starting goserelin. Whilst menses resumed for many women on cessation of goserelin, menses was still absent for 35% to 40% of women in this group at month 36.</P>
<P>Among women aged 40 years and older, amenorrhoea due to chemotherapy was observed sooner than among the younger women, affecting 80% to 90% of these patients by the end of six cycles of CMF. In these older women who started goserelin after six months of chemotherapy, amenorrhoea was induced in more than 90% within three months of starting this drug, and remained so at month 36.</P>
<P>Quality of life has been reported in detail for 874 patients in the IBCSG VIII trial, based on an assessment at 36 months for 746 of these 874 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bernhard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhard 2007</LINK>). Patients in the goserelin alone group showed a marked improvement or less deterioration in various quality of life indicators during the first six months compared to those receiving chemotherapy. But, there was no significant difference in quality of life at 36 months between the groups allocated chemotherapy followed by goserelin versus goserelin alone.</P>
<P>The TABLE study recruited 599 premenopausal patients who were not known to be ER- (<LINK REF="STD-TABLE" TYPE="STUDY">TABLE</LINK>). The inclusion criteria were amended part way through the trial, so that only ER+ patients were randomised. Although 599 patients were recruited, results for the 589 patients in the intention-to-treat population have been published, with a median follow up of 69 months. No significant differences were found between the treatments on either recurrence-free survival or overall survival. The 5-year disease-free survival was 63.9% for women allocated leuprorelin compared to 63.4% for women allocated chemotherapy. Over 95% of women in the leuprorelin group became amenorrhoeic during treatment, compared to 62.1% of women treated with chemotherapy. The most common adverse events were low-grade hot flushes, oedema, and fatigue among the leuprorelin patients; and alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue among the chemotherapy patients. The overall assessment of tolerability by patients was markedly better during the first six months of treatment in the leuprorelin group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups at two years.</P>
<P>The GABG study recruited 771 node-negative premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_A_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-A-93</LINK>). No significant differences were found between the treatments on local recurrence, distant recurrence, event-free survival, or death without recurrence. The 5-year event-free survival was 85.0% for women allocated goserelin compared to 81.0% for women allocated chemotherapy. The estimated hazard ratio using an intention-to-treat analysis for goserelin versus CMF was 0.81 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.17, P = 0.25).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">B. LHRH agonists + anti-oestrogen (experimental arm) versus other treatments</HEADING>
<P>Six trials were identified that addressed the combination of an LHRH-agonist plus an anti-oestrogen versus another treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Two of these compared an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen to tamoxifen alone (<LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>).

Most trials used goserelin 3.6 mg depot every 28 days. Goserelin was given for two years in <LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>, for three years in <LINK REF="STD-ABCSG-5" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ABCSG_x002d_12" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG-12</LINK>, and for five years in <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-FASG-06" TYPE="STUDY">FASG 06</LINK> trial used triptorelin 3.75 mg IM every 28 days for three years. Tamoxifen was given at a dose of 20 mg in all studies except for <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK> (some patients received 40 mg) and <LINK REF="STD-FASG-06" TYPE="STUDY">FASG 06</LINK> (30 mg).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">i. LHRH agonist and tamoxifen versus tamoxifen</HEADING>
<P>All women in the ZIPP trial were randomised to goserelin versus the same treatment but without goserelin, which included comparisons of women receiving tamoxifen with and without goserelin, and women who did not receive tamoxifen and were randomised to goserelin or not (<LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). Among the 2710 women in this trial, 905 women were randomised to receive tamoxifen and 860 received tamoxifen electively. However, the main analyses for the trial have been reported on the basis of goserelin versus no goserelin, not separately in the presence and absence of tamoxifen. After a median follow up of 66 months, patients randomised to goserelin had significantly better recurrence-free survival (73%) and overall survival (86%) than those allocated to no goserelin (68% and 83%, respectively). The hazard ratio was 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.82, P = 0.002) for recurrence-free survival and 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99, P = 0.038) for overall survival. These overall effects of goserelin versus no goserelin were reported to be similar in women who received tamoxifen, either electively or by randomisation. Subgroup analyses have also been reported on the basis of ER status, with benefits for goserelin compared to no goserelin in recurrence-free survival and overall survival for women in each of the three subgroups (ER-, ER+, or ER unknown). However, these subgroup analyses have less statistical power than the overall results; most are not statistically significant and there is insufficient evidence from the ZIPP trial to assess differences in effect among ER subgroups in the presence of tamoxifen. The proportion of patients who experienced at least one side effect in the ZIPP trial was 65% among patients randomised to tamoxifen and goserelin and 41% among patients allocated to tamoxifen alone. The most common side effects were hot flushes (44% versus 17%) and weight gain (11% versus 7%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>As noted above, the goserelin and tamoxifen treatment group was closed early in the Japanese trial, with only 20 patients allocated to this group, because of slow accrual (<LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii. LHRH agonist and tamoxifen versus LHRH agonist</HEADING>
<P>The ZIPP trial randomised 1800 women to tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen, of whom 901 had been randomised to goserelin (<LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). This led to a randomised comparison of goserelin (444 patients) versus goserelin and tamoxifen (457). However, the effects on event-free survival and overall survival within this comparison have not been reported. Overall, after a median follow up of 66 months, patients randomised to tamoxifen (which included those randomised to no goserelin) had statistically significantly better event-free survival (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92) compared to those randomised to no tamoxifen, but the difference on overall survival was not statistically significant (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02). As with the goserelin versus tamoxifen randomisation, data have been published on major reported side effects. These were experienced by 56% of patients allocated goserelin alone and by 65% of patients allocated goserelin and tamoxifen. The most common side effect was hot flushes (26% versus 44%), followed by weight gain (4% versus 11%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The US Intergroup trial recruited women treated with CAF chemotherapy and randomised them to three groups: goserelin and tamoxifen versus goserelin versus no hormonal therapy (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>). This trial recruited premenopausal women who had node-positive breast cancer and were ER+. After a median follow up of 115 months, recurrence-free survival was significantly better for patients randomised to tamoxifen, chemotherapy and goserelin (68%) versus chemotherapy and goserelin alone (60%) (HR 0.73, P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference for overall survival (76% versus 73%, HR 0.91, P = 0.21).</P>
<P>In the Japanese trial, the comparison of goserelin versus goserelin and tamoxifen has not been reported because the goserelin and tamoxifen option was closed early due to slow accrual, when only 20 patients had been allocated to this group (<LINK REF="STD-ZBCSG-Trial-B" TYPE="STUDY">ZBCSG Trial B</LINK>).</P>

One of these trials used CMF in six cycles each taking 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-ABCSG-5" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG 5</LINK>), and the other used an anthracycline-containing regimen, FEC50 (<LINK REF="STD-FASG-06" TYPE="STUDY">FASG 06</LINK>). The ABSCG 05 trial used intravenous cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 8 (<LINK REF="STD-ABCSG-5" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG 5</LINK>), and goserelin (3.6 mg depot) every 28 days for three years with tamoxifen (20 mg daily) for five years. In the FASG 06 trial, triptorelin (3.75 mg im every month) and tamoxifen (30mg daily) were used for three years.</P>
<P>The largest trial, ABCSG 5, randomised just over a 1000 premenopausal women to goserelin (3.6 mg depot every 28 days) for three years combined with tamoxifen (20 mg daily) for five years versus CMF every 28 days for six cycles (<LINK REF="STD-ABCSG-5" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG 5</LINK>). Most of the women were ER+. After a median follow up of 60 months, patients randomised to goserelin and tamoxifen had significantly better recurrence-free survival (81%) than those allocated to chemotherapy (76%) (P = 0.037). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the hormonal therapy group (92%) and the chemotherapy group (90%) (P = 0.195). Hot flushes were the main side effect for patients in the goserelin and tamoxifen group: 91% of patients experienced at least one. The side effects of chemotherapy were typical of CMF: nausea (81%), alopecia (55%), and hot flushes (54%).</P>
<P>An anthracycline-containing regimen, rather than CMF, was used as the chemotherapy in the FASG 06 trial (<LINK REF="STD-FASG-06" TYPE="STUDY">FASG 06</LINK>); 333 premenopusal women with hormone responsive breast cancer were randomised to triptorelin (3.75 mg im every month) and tamoxifen (30 mg daily) for three years versus FEC50. After a median follow up of 83 months, recurrence-free survival was 76% in the hormonal therapy group and 72% in the chemotherapy group. This difference was non-significant (P = 0.13). There was also no significant difference for overall survival (P = 0.20): 91% and 88%, respectively. All women treated with triptorelin became amenorrhoeic during treatment compared to 64% in the chemotherapy group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">iv. LHRH agonist and aromatase inhibitor versus LHRH agonist and tamoxifen</HEADING>
<P>The Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group-12 trial recruited 1803 premenopausal women with stage 1 or stage 2 hormone receptor positive breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-ABCSG_x002d_12" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG-12</LINK>), and randomised them using a two-by-two factorial design. The first randomisation (relevant to this review) was to either goserelin plus tamoxifen or goserelin plus anastrozole (all for three years). The second randomisation (not relevant to this review) was to receiving concurrent intravenous zoledronic acid or not. Patients were required to have less than 10 positive axillary lymph nodes and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (approximately 5% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy). After median follow up of 48 months, disease-free survival (the primary endpoint) did not differ between patients receiving the two different hormonal treatments (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.53, P = 0.59). The hazard ratio for recurrence-free survival was 1.11 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.56, P = 0.53) and for overall survival was 1.80 {95% CI 0.95 to 3.38, P = 0.70). The number of events in each arm was small (72 versus 65 disease-free survival events, 27 versus 15 deaths). Women receiving anastrozole experienced significantly more arthralgia, bone pain, and morning stiffness. More women receiving tamoxifen experienced thrombosis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">i. LHRH agonist and chemotherapy versus LHRH agonist</HEADING>
<P>One trial was identified which compared an LHRH agonist versus chemotherapy followed by an LHRH agonist (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>). This randomised just over 1000 patients to CMF alone versus CMF followed by goserelin versus goserelin alone. Two thirds of the women in the trial were ER+ (720 of 1111, 68%), 315 (30%) were ER-, and 28 (3%) had unknown ER status. Overall, with a median follow up of 84 months, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in disease-free survival or overall survival. The five-year disease-free survival was 87% (95% CI 83% to 91%) for chemotherapy followed by goserelin and 79% (95% CI 75% to 84%) for goserelin alone. The relative risk for chemotherapy followed by goserelin versus goserelin alone was 0.71 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.99, P = 0.04). However, as noted above, an interaction was found between treatment and ER status. ER- patients appeared to derive much more benefit from the combination of chemotherapy and goserelin than ER+ patients. Among ER- patients, the disease-free recurrence was 88% (95% CI 82% to 94%) in the chemotherapy and goserelin group compared to 73% (95% CI 64% to 81%) in the goserelin alone group (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87, P = 0.01). Whereas, among ER+ patients, the disease-free survival was 86% (95% CI 82% to 91%) in the chemotherapy and goserelin group versus 81% (95% CI 76% to 87%) in the goserelin alone group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.26, P = 0.40).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii. LHRH agonist and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Five eligible studies were identified that assessed the addition of an LHRH agonist to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_B_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-B-93</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pretoria" TYPE="STUDY">Pretoria</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). These used a variety of chemotherapy regimens. The Intergroup trial used CAF; the GABG trial used CMF for patients with fewer than four positive lymph nodes, and a combination of CMF and EC for patients with four to nine positive nodes; and the IBCSG VIII and the Pretoria trials used CMF. Chemotherapy in the ZIPP trial was determined locally, with a recommendation for CMF in the trial protocol but with some centres choosing to use FEC instead. In four of the five trials, the LHRH agonist was goserelin (3.6 mg depot every 28 days), lasting five years in the INT-0101 trial, three years in the GABG trial, two years in ZIPP, and eighteen months in the IBCSG trial. Depot buserelin (6.6 mg monthly) was used in the Pretoria trial.</P>
<P>The ZIPP trial is the largest study in this review (<LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). After a median follow up of 66 months, the primary analyses of goserelin versus no goserelin (regardless of the presence or absence of chemotherapy) showed that patients randomised to goserelin had significantly better recurrence free survival (73%) and overall survival (86%) than those allocated to no goserelin (68% and 83%, respectively). These correspond to a hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.82, P = 0.002) for recurrence-free survival and 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99, P = 0.038) for overall survival. Despite this, data comparing goserelin versus no goserelin in the (non-randomised) subgroup of patients who all received chemotherapy has not been published.</P>
<P>The next largest trial is the US Intergroup trial of CAF chemotherapy followed by a three-way randomisation to goserelin and tamoxifen versus goserelin versus no hormonal therapy (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>). This trial recruited 1503 premenopausal women who had node-positive breast cancer and were ER+. After a median follow up of 115 months, there was no statistically significant difference in recurrence-free survival (60% versus 57%, HR 0.93, P = 0.22) or overall survival (73% versus 70%, HR 0.88, P = 0.14) in patients randomised to the addition of goserelin to chemotherapy and those allocated to chemotherapy alone.</P>
<P>The IBCSG VIII trial randomised just over 1000 patients to CMF alone versus CMF followed by goserelin versus goserelin alone (<LINK REF="STD-IBCSG-VIII" TYPE="STUDY">IBCSG VIII</LINK>). Two thirds of the women were ER+ (720 of 1111, 68%), 315 (30%) were ER-, and 28 (3%) had unknown ER status. Overall, with a median follow up of 84 months, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in disease-free survival or overall survival. The five-year disease-free survival was 82% (95% CI 78% to 86%) for chemotherapy alone, and 87% (95% CI 83% to 91%) for chemotherapy followed by goserelin. In the comparison of the combination of chemotherapy and goserelin versus chemotherapy, the relative risk for disease-free survival was 0.80 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.11, P = 0.17). This was similar in both the ER+ and ER- subgroups (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.19, P = 0.26; and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.39, P = 0.35, respectively).</P>
<P>The GABG-IV-B-93 trial was initially restricted to patients who were known to be hormone receptor negative, and 60% of the 776 women in the trial were ER- (<LINK REF="STD-GABG-IV_x002d_B_x002d_93" TYPE="STUDY">GABG IV-B-93</LINK>). ER+ patients were subsequently included. Median follow up at time of last reporting was 66 months in ER- patients and 48 months in ER+ patients. Amongst all patients, the 5-year recurrence-free survival was 71% for goserelin and 68% for no goserelin (HR 0.92, 0.70 to 1.21, P = 0.54). Overall survival was also similar between groups (86% versus 85%, respectively). In the ER- patients, there was again no difference in recurrence-free survival noted (HR 1.01, 0.72 to 1.42, P = 0.97) and, in the ER+ patients, there was also no difference in recurrence-free survival (HR for goserelin versus no goserelin 0.77, 0.47 to 1.24, P = 0.27).</P>
<P>The Pretoria trial randomised 148 premenopausal women to CMF or CMF followed by depot buserelin (<LINK REF="STD-Pretoria" TYPE="STUDY">Pretoria</LINK>). The differences between the treatments on disease-free survival and overall survival were not statistically significant in this relatively small trial, with a disease-free interval of 6.8 years for women in the combination therapy group compared to 6.2 years for women in the chemotherapy alone group.</P>

<P>Two studies also included a randomisation in which the combination of goserelin and tamoxifen added to chemotherapy were compared with chemotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZIPP" TYPE="STUDY">ZIPP</LINK>). The tamoxifen was for five years in INT-0101 and two years in ZIPP. Furthermore, the MAM 01 trial used a 2 x 2 factorial design to randomise women to CMF versus A-CMF, and goserelin and tamoxifen for two years versus no hormonal therapy (<LINK REF="STD-MAM-01-GOCSI" TYPE="STUDY">MAM 01 GOCSI</LINK>).</P>
<P>As described above, the results for the ZIPP trial have not been published separately for women randomised to goserelin plus tamoxifen versus control, neither overall nor in the presence of chemotherapy. Although the results were available for a group of women in ZIPP who received chemotherapy, LHRH agonist and tamoxifen and for another group who received chemotherapy alone, the former included some women who were electively given tamoxifen and the latter included some women who were electively not given this drug (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2006</LINK>). Thus, the analyses available for the ZIPP trial come, in part, from a non-randomised comparison and are not presented here.</P>
<P>The INT-0101 trial had a 3-arm randomisation for women after CAF chemotherapy to goserelin and tamoxifen versus goserelin versus no hormonal therapy (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-5188-INT_x002d_0101" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG 5188 INT-0101</LINK>). This trial recruited 1503 premenopausal women who had node-positive breast cancer and were ER+. After a median follow up of 115 months, patients randomised to the addition of goserelin and tamoxifen to chemotherapy appeared to have better recurrence free survival (68%) than those allocated chemotherapy alone (57%) and better overall survival (76% versus 70%). However, the associated hazard ratios and significance tests for this comparison have not been published.</P>
<P>The MAM-01 study included two randomisations for premenopausal women, 79% of whom had ER+ or ER-unknown tumours (<LINK REF="STD-MAM-01-GOCSI" TYPE="STUDY">MAM 01 GOCSI</LINK>). The first randomisation was for the use, or not, of doxorubicin before CMF; and the second, of relevance to this review, was of the addition of two years of goserelin and tamoxifen versus chemotherapy alone. The trial was closed early because of slower than anticipated accrual. After a median follow up of 72 months, the estimated probability of being disease free at five years was significantly higher for the chemotherapy, goserelin and tamoxifen group (64%), compared to the chemotherapy alone group (53%), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.99, P = 0.04). The interaction between treatment effect and ER status was investigated and was not statistically significant. The estimated 5-year overall survival was 82% for the chemo-hormonal therapy group, and 80% for the women who were allocated to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.32).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-06 12:58:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified 14 randomised trials relevant to the role of LHRH agonists in the treatment of women with breast cancer, involving a total of over 13,000 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer, the majority of whom were ER+. For most of the treatment comparisons assessed in this review there are too few trials, too few randomised patients, or too little follow up to obtain reliable estimates of the relative effects of different treatment options. Nonetheless, some conclusions about the general direction of the results are possible. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>LHRH agonist monotherapy compared with other systemic treatments</B>
</P>
<P>Insufficient data have been presented to date for a meta-analysis that would reliably inform a choice between either tamoxifen or goserelin as sole adjuvant therapy. Taken together, these trials point to similar effects for LHRH agonists, compared to chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER+ tumours, in terms of recurrence-free survival and overall survival. These results largely relate to the use of outdated chemotherapy regimens and it is uncertain how the findings from the trials would relate to the comparison of LHRH agonists with more modern chemotherapy. Additionally, the studies compare LHRH agonists to chemotherapy and not to the combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen, which is the current standard of care. The trials also demonstrate that hormonal therapy has a more favourable toxicity profile than the forms of chemotherapy assessed.</P>
<P>
<B>LHRH agonists plus anti-oestrogens compared with other systemic treatments</B>
</P>
<P>Taken together, the trials are suggestive of, but not conclusive for, reduced rates of breast cancer recurrence for premenopausal women who take goserelin combined with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy compared to goserelin alone. Longer follow up of patients is needed to estimate any benefits more reliably. There are insufficient data to draw comparisons between goserelin plus tamoxifen versus tamoxifen.</P>
<P>The trials also suggest a reduction in breast cancer recurrence, but not death, with the use of an LHRH agonist plus tamoxfen versus (outdated) chemotherapy. The data comparing LHRH agonists plus tamoxifen versus LHRH agonists plus anastrozole are currently inconclusive given the small number of patients analysed, the short follow-up period, and the highly selected patient cohorts used in the relevant study.</P>
<P>
<B>LHRH agonist plus chemotherapy compared with other systemic treatments</B>
</P>
<P>The trials suggest no differences in recurrence or overall survival between the use of LHRH agonists alone and LHRH agonists plus chemotherapy. The relevant data only includes a small number of patients from a single study however, and thus definitive results for this comparison remain inconclusive. There is a suggestion of a reduction in recurrence demonstrated for LHRH agonists (without tamoxifen) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.</P>
<P>
<B>LHRH agonists plus tamoxifen plus chemotherapy compared with other systemic treatments</B>
<BR/>Taken together, these trials demonstrate reductions in recurrence and death for premenopausal women with ER+ tumours who take LHRH agonists with tamoxifen in addition to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.<BR/>
<BR/>Design characteristics of the available randomised trials also influence the ability to draw firm conclusions about the relevant benefits and harms of LHRH agonists and chemotherapy. As described in the Results section, the majority of trials used goserelin as the LHRH agonist of choice. While it is likely that a class effect occurs, it remains unclear if the results can be extrapolated to other LHRH agonists. The optimal duration of these drugs is also unknown. We have identified no direct randomised comparisons of different LHRH agonists or different durations of these drugs. In addition, nearly all of the trials used CMF as the chemotherapy. This has been largely superseded by anthracycline-based regimens (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>), and by the use of newer agents such as taxanes and trastuzumab. It is uncertain how the findings from the CMF-based trials in this review would relate to the use of LHRH agonists with these more modern regimens.</P>
<P>Further follow up of the women in the included studies, and the findings of ongoing and future trials, will allow an overall estimate of the effects of these different LHRH agonist regimens and comparisons to be calculated from a meta-analyses. This would also be facilitated by the use of individual patient data and many of the trialists are currently collaborating in such projects ( <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cuzick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuzick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LHRH_x002d_Agonists-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">LHRH-Agonists 2007</LINK>). One of these indivdual patient data reviews was published in 2007 and focused on women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-LHRH_x002d_Agonists-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">LHRH-Agonists 2007</LINK>). It included many of the comparisons that are also reported in the present review, and was based on a median follow up of about seven years. The following percentage changes in hazard ratios were reported relating to overall survival and recurrence-free survival (see Description of studies) and analysed by the LHRH-Agonists Early Breast Cancer Overview Group.</P>

<P>Currently, the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer is single agent tamoxifen for five years. The most recent EBCTCG overview showed that five years of tamoxifen, compared to no adjuvant therapy, is associated with a 41% reduction in the annual risk of relapse and a 34% reduction in the annual risk of death among women with ER+ breast cancer. This benefit was shown to be independent of chemotherapy use (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>). It is important to recognise that none of the trials included in this review contain a control arm of chemotherapy + tamoxifen, the current standard of care. It is this standard of care against which LHRH agonists need to be assessed (that is chemotherapy + tamoxifen versus chemotherapy + tamoxifen + LHRH agonists) to better establish their role in modern practice.</P>
<P>It has not been possible to address some of the other objectives of this Cochrane review because of a lack of available data on, for example, duration of amenorrhoea, rates of restoration of menses, HER-2 status and familial breast cancer. If results become available from the included studies, ongoing trials or future trials, these will be incorporated into updates of this review.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:00:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For premenopausal women with ER+ early breast cancer, the inclusion of an LHRH agonist as adjuvant therapy is likely to lead to a reduction in the risk of a recurrence and a delay in death. The current standard of care is single-agent tamoxifen, however, and available trials do not assess the role of LHRH agonists as an integrated addition to or substitute for this paradigm. It therefore remains difficult to assess the role of LHRH agonists in clinical practice. For cases where tamoxifen is inappropriate and the choice lies between an LHRH agonist or chemotherapy, the review does not provide evidence to choose between them on the basis of recurrence-free survival or overall survival for ER+ women. Whether this holds in the context of modern chemotherapy regimens is less certain. However, for ER- women chemotherapy is likely to lead to a reduction in the risk of recurrence and a delay in death compared to an LHRH agonist. There are fewer severe adverse effects amongst women treated with LHRH agonists in comparison to chemotherapy. The LHRH agonist for which there is most evidence is goserelin, given as a 3.6 mg depot subcutaneously every 28 days for two to three years.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:01:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most pressing area of research is assessment of the role for LHRH agonists when added to standard care regimens including modern chemotherapy regimens and tamoxifen. A number of ongoing studies (see below) are examining this issue and will answer the questions of this review with greater certainty. In addition, further trials examining the use of aromatase inhibitors in conjunction with LHRH agonists are warranted, given that aromatase inhibitors have demonstrated a disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women when compared to tamoxifen.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review need to continue follow up in order to provide reliable evidence on the long-term outcomes for these different treatment strategies, as is now possible for other adjuvant treatment comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>). There is also a need for randomised comparisons of different durations of LHRH agonists (for example two years versus longer). Randomised trials comparing an LHRH agonist with ovarian ablation by surgery or radiotherapy would also help to show whether there are important differences in the methods of ovarian inactivation and the effects of reversible versus irreversible suppression of ovarian function. </P>

<P>The specific objectives outlined in this review address a wider range of comparisons than those in the initial protocol (or previous versions of this review). The decision to include the comparisons listed in this version of the review was made on the basis that the general objective was to assess the role of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant therapy of premenopausal women with breast cancer in general, and not specifically in certain combinations or compared with certain therapies.</P>
