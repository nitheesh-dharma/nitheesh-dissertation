<P>Diseases of the heart and blood vessels account for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Compared to their non-diabetic counterparts the relative risk of mortality caused by disorders of the heart and blood vessels is two to three for men and three to four for women with diabetes.

Several medications are on the market to treat diabetes, amongst them pioglitazone as a member of the 'glitazones' reduced risk factors for diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Since the two biggest trials in people with type 2 diabetes showed that improved blood glucose alone is not enough to reduce the risk of the above mentioned diseases we looked for longer-term studies investigating 24 weeks as a minimum of pioglitazone treatment on patient-oriented outcomes.

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-08 14:57:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diabetes has long been recognised as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Prospective studies show that compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four. The two biggest trials in type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study did not reveal a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control. Theoretical benefits of the newer peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) activators like pioglitazone on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors might result in fewer macrovascular disease events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-two trials which randomised approximately 6200 people to pioglitazone treatment were identified. Longest duration of therapy was 34.5 months. Published studies of at least 24 weeks pioglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide convincing evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically relevant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Occurrence of oedema was significantly raised. The results of the single trial with relevant clinical endpoints (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events - PROactive study) have to be regarded as hypothesis-generating and need confirmation.</P>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>There are two main types of diabetes mellitus, type 1 (formerly termed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 (formerly termed non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus):</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia due to absolute deficiency of insulin secretion which is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic &#946;-cells. Evidence of autoimmunity is provided by the appearance of autoantibodies prior to the onset of clinical disease. The clinical presentation ranges from mild nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms to coma. Although type 1 diabetes usually develops before 30 years of age, it can occur at any age. At presentation, most patients are thin and have experienced weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and diabetic ketoacidosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the actions and secretion of insulin are impaired, as opposed to the absolute deficiency of insulin that occurs with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by two major pathophysiologic defects: (1) insulin resistance, which results in increased hepatic glucose production and decreased peripheral glucose disposal, (2) impaired &#946;-cell secretory function (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1997</LINK>). Insulin resistance is an impaired biological response to the effects of exogenous or endogenous insulin. Insulin resistance in the hepatic and peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, leads to unrestrained hepatic glucose production and diminished insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake and utilization (<LINK REF="REF-DeFronzo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeFronzo 1992</LINK>). Insulin secretion by the pancreatic &#946;-cell is initially sufficient to compensate for insulin resistance, thereby maintaining normal blood glucose levels. Hyperinsulinaemia, which accompanies insulin resistance, can maintain sufficiently normal glucose metabolism as long as pancreatic &#946;-cell function remains normal. However, in patients who may develop type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion eventually fails, leading to hyperglycaemia and clinical diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Warram-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warram 1990</LINK>). Individuals with type 2 diabetes may have few or no classic clinical symptoms (see above) of hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Ruige-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruige 1997</LINK>). The difficulty in maintaining metabolic control, for example measured by the level of glycosylated haemoglobin A<SUB>1c</SUB> (HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>) over time may be related to several behavioural factors (for example difficulties with healthy eating, exercise, medication regimens) but primarily reflects the underlying progressive decline in &#946;-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_16-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-16 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Type 2 diabetes has traditionally been treated in a stepwise manner, starting with lifestyle modifications (<LINK REF="REF-Armour-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armour 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gimenez_x002d_Perez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimenez-Perez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>) and later on pharmacotherapy with oral agents. Several classes of oral agents are available for clinical use. These mainly include insulin secretagogues, drugs that delay the absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin sensitisers. Over time, many patients with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin secretagogues: Currently, the sulphonylureas used are mainly glibenclamide (glyburide), glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride. These drugs stimulate pancreatic &#946;-cell insulin secretion by binding to a sulphonylurea receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Lindberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindberg 2002</LINK>). The short-acting non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogues are repaglinide and nateglinide (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2003</LINK>). These are newer agents that also stimulate insulin secretion by binding to the sulphonylurea receptor.<BR/>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: Acarbose and miglitol are &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors. These drugs slow the absorption of carbohydrates, reducing especially postprandial elevations in plasma glucose levels. They do not significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels but cause a modest reduction in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin sensitisers: Metformin belongs to the biguanides class (<LINK REF="REF-Saenz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2003</LINK>). It might increase insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose production. Metformin also seems to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake in the muscle. These substances consist of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. The thiazolidinediones decrease insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue by activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#947; (PPAR-&#947;) which increases production of proteins involved in glucose uptake. They also decrease hepatic glucose production by improving hepatic insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Meriden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriden 2004</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus can be treated by non-pharmacological (diet, exercise) and pharmacological means. Insulin, as the natural hormone of the body, might be given as animal (mainly pork or beef) insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>), genetically constructed 'human' insulin or as insulin-'analogues' with a modified molecular structure compared to human insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>). Insulin is currently administered by diabetic people in various ways: Subcutaneous injections, insulin pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>) and maybe in future by inhalation (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>). Oral antidiabetic agents are most often used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in its initial stages if lifestyle modifications have failed. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone offer new oral treatment options and affect many tissues and parts of the body. In order to evaluate their effects not only on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus but also on patient-oriented outcomes like cardiovascular disease, longer-term studies of at least 24 weeks continuous intake will be critically appraised in this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>An increase in bodyweight has been associated with pioglitazone. Oedema, anaemia and congestive heart failure have been reported in patients receiving pioglitazone. There are conflicting reports about liver function abnormalities associated with pioglitazone use (<LINK REF="REF-Farley_x002d_Hills-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley-Hills 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hisamochi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hisamochi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajagopalan-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajagopalan 2005a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:11:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Because traditional agents have a limited impact on insulin resistance and &#946;-cell function, thiazolidinediones may be an appropriate choice especially for combination therapy in patients achieving poor glycaemic control with initial monotherapy. By improving insulin sensitivity, thiazolidinediones may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. The excess cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes cannot be attributed to classic risk factors alone (mainly hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking), but if present, these risk factors are at least as important as in patients without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). One explanation for the beneficial effects of thiazolidinediones is their unique mechanism of action as selective and potent inhibitors of PPAR-&#947;. PPAR-&#947; receptors are present in adipose, hepatic and skeletal muscle tissue and control insulin-responsive genes, which have a wide-ranging influence. Thiazolidinediones appear to improve markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis, exert beneficial effects on vascular reactivity, improve the lipid profile and fat distribution, and decrease pancreatic &#946;-cell injury.<BR/>Pioglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione group which also encompasses troglitazone (withdrawn due to hepatic toxicity) and rosiglitazone. It increases the sensitivity of skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue to insulin without directly stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic ß-cells. Differences in the side chain on the main thiazolidine-structure in comparison to rosiglitazone are thought to be responsible for the distinct bioavailability, metabolism and antihyperglycaemic potency of pioglitazone. Pioglitazone has several pharmacodynamic properties which could ameliorate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, pioglitazone has been associated with reductions in the levels of triglycerides and increases in the levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Some surrogate parameters indicating especially cardiovascular risk were reported to be positively influenced by pioglitazone therapy.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-06 22:59:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes has long been recognised as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Laakso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laakso 1999</LINK>). Prospective studies show that compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). The increased cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is reflected in the observation that middle-aged individuals with diabetes have mortality and morbidity risks that are similar to non-diabetic individuals who have already suffered a cardiovascular event (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1998</LINK>).<BR/>Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease (for example diabetic retinopathy) but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study was the first published long-term investigation of people with type 2 diabetes indicating no reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control but raised cardiovascular mortality after tolbutamide treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UGDP-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">UGDP 1982</LINK>). The study of Ohkubo et al. which included relatively lean Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, was the first to demonstrate prevention of microvascular complications by intensive glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Ohkubo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohkubo 1995</LINK>). This study did not address the question of whether good glycaemic control retards the progression of macrovascular disease. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) tested mainly whether intensive glucose control with either a sulphonylurea or insulin influences the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications compared with conventional treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). The 10-year results of the UKPDS evaluated drug treatment in non obese and obese participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were referred to hospital clinics. Over 10 years, HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> was 7.0% in the intensive group compared with 7.9% in the conventional group. The 0.9% difference in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> between the intensive and conventional groups over 10 years was smaller than the 1.9% difference (9.0% and 7.1%) in HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The DCCT studied younger patients with type 1 diabetes and assessed the effects of intensive versus conventional insulin therapy on the incidence of microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) over a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>). The risk of retinopathy, for example, was statistically significant reduced by intensive insulin therapy with a number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit of six (six type 1 diabetic patients need to be treated by intensive in comparison to conventional insulin therapy over 6.5 years to avoid one additional patient to develop diabetic retinopathy). The UKPDS had a factorial design meaning that another study investigating intensive versus regular blood pressure control (<LINK REF="REF-HDS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>) was imbedded in the main study. Intensive versus conventional glucose control did not result in a statistically significant difference in diabetes related mortality or macrovascular disease endpoints but reduced the relative risk in the 'any diabetes related aggregate endpoint' (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2003</LINK>). Most of this benefit was due to a reduction in microvascular endpoints including the incidence of retinal photocoagulation, which was assessed by ophthalmologists independent of the study. In the UKPDS, the NNT to prevent one patient developing any of the single endpoints over 10 years was 20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 500) (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). In contrast to these results, the publication of the UKPDS-34, which focused on obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, described several clinically important differences in macrovascular disease endpoints with 10 years of treatment with metformin (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-34 1998</LINK>). In particular, the absolute risk reduction for the aggregate endpoints was more than 10% and for overall mortality was 7%, giving NNTs of 10 and 14, respectively, over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2000</LINK>).<BR/>The UKPDS was criticised on several grounds especially emphasising hidden biases in interpreting the results of this randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1998</LINK>). Stratton et al. in their UKPDS-35 publication are often cited, who tried to determine the relation between exposure to glycaemia over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in the UKPDS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>). This publication is an epidemiological re-interpretation of UKPDS data proclaiming that with each 1% reduction in mean HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>, relative reductions in risk of 21% for deaths related to diabetes and 14% for myocardial infarction could be observed. The RCT itself, though, did not show significant differences in this respect. Moreover, the UKPDS-38, investigating tight versus less tight blood pressure control with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a &#946;-blocker atenolol as main treatment, showed relative risk reductions (in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control) of 24% in diabetes related endpoints, 32% in deaths related to diabetes, 44% in strokes and 37% in microvascular endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>). Due to the factorial design of the UKPDS with two interventions (improvement in metabolic and blood pressure control) aiming at the same outcomes, a fair interpretation of the data needs investigation of the interaction between the two main treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2003</LINK>). UKPDS data should be available to the scientific public to evaluate, among other things, the importance of the individual contribution of improved glucose versus blood pressure control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, until now this has not happened.<BR/>Therefore, any new compound in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, like pioglitazone, should not only be evaluated with regards to surrogate outcomes (for example reductions in fasting plasma glucose or HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>) but information is urgently needed about the influence of any antidiabetic agent especially on cardiovascular endpoints, which is the greatest problem in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Short-term studies do not provide these facts, consequently we will search for longer-term investigations of at least 24 weeks pioglitazone therapy. Quite a number of health technology assessment reports, (narrative) reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluated interventions with pioglitazone in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Baba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bloomgarden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomgarden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chilcott-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilcott 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiquette-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiquette 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czoski_x002d_Murray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czoski-Murray 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Natali-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natali 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qayyum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qayyum 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waugh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waugh 2006</LINK>). All of them either suffer from methodological problems like inadequate quality assessment of primary studies, focus on surrogate outcomes or are out-of-date. This systematic review tries to collate all available data from RCTs of pioglitazone treatment and evaluates how many studies investigated patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, cardiovascular endpoints, adverse events and health-related quality of life.</P>

<P>In the event of substantial clinical or methodological or statistical heterogeneity, study results were not planned to be combined in a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was identified by visual inspection of the forest plots, by using a standard &#967;<SUP>2</SUP>-test and a significance level of &#945; = 0.1, in view of the low power of such tests. Quantification of heterogeneity was also examined with I<SUP>2</SUP>, ranging from 0-100% including its 95% confidence interval (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> demonstrates the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity and was used to judge the consistency of evidence. I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 50% and more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>With the exception of one study no trial explored mortality as an endpoint. The study by Dormandy et al was a double-blind RCT with matching placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had evidence of macrovascular disease (<LINK REF="STD-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dormandy 2005</LINK>). Placebo or pioglitazone titrated up to 45 mg/day (89% to 93% of participants) were taken in addition to the participants' glucose-lowering drugs and other medications. The average time of observation was 34.5 months. The overall mean age was 62 years with a median time of diabetes duration of eight years. At randomisation, 62% of participants were taking metformin or sulphonylureas, respectively, either as monotherapy or in combination. More than 30% of patients were on insulin.<BR/>The primary composite endpoint (time from randomisation to all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary or leg arteries, or amputation above the ankle) did not show statistically significant differences between the pioglitazone and placebo group: The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.90 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.02, P=0.095).<BR/>Of all secondary endpoints only the so-called "main" secondary endpoint (time to the first event of the composite endpoint of death from any cause, myocardial infarction (excluding silent myocardial infarction) and stroke) indicated a statistical significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo (HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P=0.027)). The individual components of the primary composite endpoint did not disclose statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups.<BR/>HbA<SUB>1c</SUB> decreased significantly by 0.8% in the pioglitazone and 0.3% in the placebo group and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly by 19% and 10%, respectively. The median change in blood pressure was 3 mm Hg versus 0 mm Hg for pioglitazone compared to placebo (P = 0.03).<BR/>Significantly more patients developed oedema and heart failure, including heart failure needing hospital admission, following administration of pioglitazone (6% versus 4% on placebo).</P>

<P>Seven studies made some statement about the number of participants who died during the course of the trial, only one study was powered to detect differences between groups in the primary composite endpoint (time from randomisation to all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary or leg arteries, or amputation above the ankle - <LINK REF="STD-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dormandy 2005</LINK>).<BR/>The percentage of overall and serious adverse events was comparable between intervention and control groups. We noted a somewhat higher discontinuation rate following pioglitazone administration especially in comparison to monotherapy with other oral antidiabetic drugs. However, true numbers are difficult to evaluate due to study protocols defining withdrawals because of lack of efficacy as a serious adverse event.<BR/>Six studies reported a more pronounced (sometimes dose-related) decrease of haemoglobin after pioglitazone intake in comparison to other active compounds or placebo. Haemoglobin reductions ranged between 0.5 and 0.75 g/dl.<BR/>Fifteen studies evaluated body weight and observed an increase up to 3.9 kg after pioglitazone treatment, seven studies described a rise in body mass index up to 1.5 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>.<BR/>Eleven of the 22 included studies showed data on hypoglycaemic episodes: Compared to active monotherapy control pioglitazone treatment resulted in somewhat lower rates of hypoglycaemia. If pioglitazone was combined with insulin more hypoglycaemic incidents happened. The biggest trial which compared pioglitazone versus placebo in combination with a variety of other glucose-lowering drugs reported hypoglycaemia rates of 27.9% after pioglitazone and 20.1% after placebo combinations (<LINK REF="STD-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dormandy 2005</LINK>). Severe hypoglycaemic events were rarely reported.<BR/>The specific adverse event "oedema" was evaluated in 18 of 22 studies. Overall, 11.565 participants provided data on the occurrence of oedema. The total number of events was 842 in the pioglitazone and 430 in the control groups. Pooling of the 18 studies by means of random-effects meta-analysis revealed a relative risk of 2.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 3.18, P &lt; 0.00001). The test for heterogeneity indicated an I<SUP>2</SUP>-value of 45.8%. The use of a fixed-effect model resulted in a risk ratio of 1.98 (95% CI 1.78 to 2.20). The robustness of this result was also tested by repeating the analysis using the odds ratio as a different measure of effect size, demonstrating an odds ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 2.34 to 4.23) and 2.22 (95% CI 1.96 to 2.52) for a random-effects and fixed-effect model, respectively. Since oedema event rates in many studies exceeded 10%, application of the risk ratio appeared to be the more valid parameter.<BR/>We repeated the analysis excluding the large study by Dormandy et al in order to establish how much it dominated the results. The relative risk in the random-effects model did not change substantially and was 2.85 (95% CI 2.27 to 3.59), but heterogeneity decreased to an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 0%. Moreover, selection of the four studies with combination therapies only did not significantly alter these results (data not shown).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This systematic review shows that published studies of at least 24 weeks pioglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide convincing evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A<SUB>1c</SUB> (HbA<SUB>1c</SUB>) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically significant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. No study investigated economic costs of pioglitazone therapy. Occurrence of oedema was significantly raised.<BR/>Twenty-one of the 22 included studies reported only surrogate outcomes, the results of the single trial with relevant clinical endpoints have to be seen as hypothesis-generating and need confirmation. We know of five ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BARI_x002d_2D" TYPE="STUDY">BARI-2D</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHICAGO" TYPE="STUDY">CHICAGO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PERISCOPE" TYPE="STUDY">PERISCOPE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PPAR" TYPE="STUDY">PPAR</LINK>, see also <LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 2005</LINK>) which eventually could contribute valuable information about the role of pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (for details see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies').

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic indication</HEADING>
<P>According to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) "pioglitazone is indicated as oral monotherapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly overweight patients, inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (www.emea.eu.int). Pioglitazone is also indicated for oral combination treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of oral monotherapy with either metformin or sulphonylurea:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>in combination with metformin only in obese patients;</LI>
<LI>in combination with a sulphonylurea only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated."</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>In the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 'INDICATIONS AND USAGE label' (www.fda.gov) pioglitazone (ACTOS) "is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM). ACTOS is indicated for monotherapy. ACTOS is also indicated for use in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin when diet and exercise plus the single agent does not result in adequate glycemic control."</P>
<P>Patients and physicians alike need to know why the two biggest drug agencies in the world established different criteria for the therapeutic indication of pioglitazone usage. Supposedly, both received very similar data from the manufacturer of pioglitazone. Moreover, taking into account our in- and exclusion criteria, only a single trial of at least 24 weeks duration of pioglitazone treatment explicitly provided data fulfilling the criteria by the EMEA (Matthews 2005).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events) study</HEADING>
<P>The PROactive study was a much anticipated trial because it was the first large-scale study to be reported that was designed to determine whether the theoretical benefits of pioglitazone on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors might result in fewer macrovascular disease events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Much debate centred around issues of interpretation ( <LINK REF="REF-Skyler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skyler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skyler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skyler 2006</LINK>).<BR/>In the Lancet publication (Dormandy 2005) a "main" secondary endpoint, consisting of the time to the first event of the composite endpoint of death from any cause, myocardial infarction (excluding silent myocardial infarction), and stroke showed significant statistical differences in favour of pioglitazone The other mentioned secondary endpoints cardiovascular death and time to individual components of the primary composite endpoint did not reveal statistical significant differences.<BR/>In the Diabetes Care publication of the study design and baseline characteristics (see under included studies <LINK REF="STD-Dormandy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dormandy 2005</LINK>, additional non-primary studies) individual components of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular mortality were specified as secondary outcomes.<BR/>Databases of ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov published with identifier NCT00174993) stated: "Primary Outcomes: Time to death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention (PCI/CABG), stroke, leg amputation, revascularization in the leg. Minimum 30 months follow up. Secondary Outcomes: Adverse events".<BR/>In a recent letter to the editor published in the Lancet, the PROactive study executive committee and data and safety monitoring committee in response to the criticism stated (<LINK REF="REF-PROactive-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">PROactive 2006</LINK>): "It has come to our attention that there is a belief in some quarters that this endpoint was not prespecified and that the finding was obtained through a post-hoc analysis ... this belief is based, in part, on an earlier publication of the PROactive study design, which listed the primary and secondary endpoints, but did not mention this specific composite ... during the latter part of 2004 and early 2005, a working party representing members of the Study Executive Committee and the sponsor prepared a formal statistical analysis plan for the study. At this time, it was recognised that the clinically important composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was not currently part of the intended analysis. This was added to the plan in a draft circulated in March, 2005, and the final version of the plan clearly identifies this endpoint as the intended main secondary endpoint. The final version was signed and released on May 13, 2005. A copy of the plan was registered as received by the US Food and Drug Administration on May 17. The study database was formally locked on May 25, and statistical analysis of unblinded data started only after that date."<BR/>The main investigator kindly provided us with the statistical analysis plan (Version 1.3 (FINAL) / 12 May 2005 AD-4833 / Pioglitazone) which states on page nine: "The study protocol identifies the following as secondary endpoints:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The individual components of the primary endpoint</LI>
<LI>Cardiovascular mortality</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, at the time of preparation of this plan, it was decided to add one further composite endpoint to the list of secondary endpoints, namely, all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction (excluding silent MI) and stroke. The reason for this addition is so that the analysis can report the extent of treatment effects with respect to an endpoint which is also used commonly in large cardiovascular outcome studies."</P>
<P>It might be correct, as the PROactive executive committee formulates, that it is legitimate for the endpoints of a study to be amended as the study progresses, but the fact that in the statistical analysis plan the new endpoint was not clearly defined as the intended <U>main</U> secondary endpoint still casts doubts on the scientific rigour of the interpretation of the PROactive study. Moreover, as explained above, these results have to be seen as hypothesis-generating and need confirmation. Single components of the composite endpoints should not be extracted and declared as being significant, even if the composite endpoint itself revealed statically significant differences, unless proven by appropriate statistical methods.</P>

<P>We focused on a minimum duration of 24 weeks pioglitazone therapy in order to have a chance to detect clinically meaningful differences in patient-oriented parameters. Theoretically, studies of a shorter duration could demonstrate a significant impact on these outcomes but this is highly unlikely, even with regards to important adverse events.<BR/>Moreover, it was difficult to separate primary studies from companion papers because the latter quite often did not identify themselves as an additional publication of a parent study (for details see 'References of included studies', primary studies are marked by an asterisk).</P>
<P>Furthermore, many publications were found which consisted of a post-hoc analyses of a varying number of published and unpublished studies. Data on file hopefully can be evaluated in future updates of this review. The following publications were additional papers summarising two or more primary studies on the efficacy of pioglitazone:<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We showed that published studies of at least 24 weeks pioglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide convincing evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. On the other hand, occurrence of oedema was significantly raised. In the largest pioglitazone endpoint trial of clinical relevance significantly more patients developed heart failure, including heart failure needing hospital admission. Until new evidence becomes available, the benefit-risk ratio of pioglitazone remains unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Five ongoing studies (ACCORD; BARI-2D; CHICAGO; PERISCOPE; PPAR) may contribute important information about the role of pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The hypothesis-generating positive findings of secondary endpoints with regard to cardiovascular outcomes of the PROactive study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events) need confirmation. Future trials should avoid confusion about outcomes by clear a-priori definition and statistical justification of anticipated endpoints.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
</CONCLUSIONS>
</BODY>
<ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS>
<P>We thank Prof John A Dormandy for sending us the final statistical analysis plan of the PROactive study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial In Macrovascular Events) in order to especially clarify issues regarding the secondary endpoints of the PROactive study. </P>

</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS/>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All 10,251 participants will be in the overarching glycemia trial. In addition, one 2 X 2 trial will also address the lipid question in 5,518 of the participants and the other 2 X 2 trial will address the blood pressure question in 4,733 of the participants.</P>
<P>The three specific primary ACCORD hypotheses are as follow. In middle-aged or older people with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for having a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event because of existing clinical or subclinical CVD or CVD risk factors:<BR/>1. does a therapeutic strategy that targets a HbA1c of &lt; 6.0% reduce the rate of CVD events more than a strategy that targets a HbA1c of 7.0% to 7.9% (with the expectation of achieving a median level of 7.5%)?<BR/>2. in the context of good glycemic control, does a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to raise HDL-C/lower triglyceride levels and uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that only uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C?<BR/>3. In the context of good glycemic control, does a therapeutic strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &lt; 120 mm Hg reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that targets a SBP of &lt; 140 mm Hg?</P>
<P>The 10,251 participants will be treated and followed for about 4 to 8 years (approximate mean of 5.6 years) at 77 Clinical Sites administratively located within 7 Clinical Center Networks in the United States and Canada. <BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The design is a randomized, multicenter, double 2 X 2 factorial design in 10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The trial is designed to test the effects on major CVD events of intensive glycemia control, of treatment to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides (in the context of good LDL-C and glycemia control), and of intensive blood pressure control (in the context of good glycemia control).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure for the trial is the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular disease event, specifically nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.</P>
<P>The ACCORD study is designed to have:<BR/>* 89% power to detect a 15% treatment effect of intensive glycemic control compared with standard glycemic control,<BR/>* 87% power to detect a 20% treatment effect of lipid control through LDL-C treatment and fibrates compared with lipid control using LDL-C treatment alone,<BR/>* 94% power to detect a 20% treatment effect of intensive blood pressure control compared with standard blood pressure control.</P>
<P>Secondary hypotheses include treatment differences in other cardiovascular outcomes, total mortality, microvascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. </P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_STARTING_DATE>
<P>Recruitment occurred in two non-contiguous periods: an initial period that began in January 2001 for the Vanguard Phase of the trial (during which 1174 participants were randomized) and then a subsequent period beginning in January 2003 and ending in October 2005. </P>
<P>Follow-up is scheduled to end in June 2009, with the primary results announced in early 2010.</P>
</CHAR_STARTING_DATE>
<CHAR_CONTACT_INFORMATION>
<P>ACCORD is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The NHLBI Project Office is responsible for the administration and monitoring of the trial.</P>
</CHAR_CONTACT_INFORMATION>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Despite the importance of this health problem in the North American population, there is a lack of definitive data on the effects of intensive control of glycemia and other CVD risk factors on CVD event rates in diabetic patients.</P>
<P>The overall goal of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is to address this challenge by testing three complementary medical treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes to enhance the options for reducing the still very high rate of major CVD morbidity and mortality in this disease.</P>

<P>2. Method of Glycemic Control Hypothesis: with a target HbA1c level of &lt;7.0%, a strategy of hyperglycemia management directed at insulin sensitization results in lower 5-year mortality compared to a strategy of insulin provision.<BR/>

<P>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effects of pioglitazone HCl versus glimepiride on the amount of thickening of the carotid artery, a large vessel in the neck. The carotid artery is measured using a noninvasive procedure called an ultrasound. It is believed that the amount of thickness of the carotid artery can be an indication of the amount of atherosclerosis or heart disease that a person has.</P>

</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS/>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic change in coronary artery. So we designed a prospective randomized multi-center trial named the pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with DM and myocardial infarction(PPAR study) to evaluate whether pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with DM(HbA1c&lt;6.5%) and myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>100 hospitals will participate in the PPAR study. Patients with DM who have history of prior myocardial infarction are randomly allocated to receive pioglitazone or (1)instructs weight reduction, appropriate diet, regular exercise and/or (2)prescribes sulfonylurea agents. The number of patients to be recruited is 3000 and this study will continue at least 2 years. The primary end-points are (1) cardiovascular mortality and (2) hospitalization for cardiovascular events. Effects in suppression of new diabetes development also will be evaluated.</P>
<P>We should recognize DM as important therapeutic target to decrease recurrence of cardiovascular events. PPAR study, a large scale multi-center trial in Japan, will provide us new evidence how to treat DM patients with prior myocardial infarction.</P>
