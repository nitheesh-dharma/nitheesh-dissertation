<P>Breast cancer accounts for one in 10 of all new cancer cases diagnosed and surgical removal of the breast is a common treatment approach. An infection of the surgical wound is often a complication of surgery and taking antibiotics just before the operation significantly reduces the chances of developing an infection. The review is not able to establish which antibiotic is most appropriate. No trials were found which considered the effect of antibiotics when the operation involved immediate breast reconstruction.</P>

<P>Surgery has been used as part of breast cancer treatment for centuries; however any surgical procedure has the potential risk of infection. Infection rates for surgical treatment of breast cancer are documented at between 3% and 15%, higher than average for a clean surgical procedure.

<P>A total of eleven studies (2867 participants) were included in the review. Ten studies evaluated preoperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic or placebo. One study evaluated perioperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic. Pooling of the results demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively significantly reduce the incidence of SSI for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery without reconstruction (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.85). Analysis of the single study comparing perioperative antibiotic with no antibiotic found no statistically significant effect of antibiotics on the incidence of SSI (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95). No studies presented separate data for patients who underwent reconstructive surgery at the time of removal of the breast tumour.</P>

<P>Prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively reduce the risk of SSI in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Further studies involving patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction are needed as studies have identified this group as being at higher risk of infection than those who do not undergo immediate breast reconstruction.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-23 16:25:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast cancer accounts for one in 10 of all new cancer cases diagnosed around the world each year (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2004</LINK>) and is the leading cause of cancer death in women (<LINK REF="REF-Pisani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisani 1999</LINK>). Surgery for removal of breast cancer has been common practice for centuries (<LINK REF="REF-Donegan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donegan 1995</LINK>) and this is normally used as part of a multi-faceted approach to care with the aim of curing the patient of their cancer in early stage tumours or prolonging life for others (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). Surgical intervention ranges from removing the breast and associated axillary lymph nodes, to lumpectomy with or without sentinel node biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK>). Whilst the risk of breast cancer for men is only 1%, treatment for men is very similar to that of women (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK>). As with all surgical procedures, breast cancer surgery runs the risk of complications. One such risk is postoperative surgical site infection (SSI), even though breast cancer surgery is considered a 'clean surgical procedure'. Clean surgical procedures, as defined by <LINK REF="REF-Haley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1985</LINK>, are those which have a low risk of bacterial contamination during the surgery.Some women have immediate breast reconstruction; however this group of patients has a higher risk of SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Spauwen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spauwen 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Despite internationally recognised infection control guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>), the incidence of SSI in those being treated for breast cancer is thought to range between 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2000</LINK>) and 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2003</LINK>). This is a higher incidence of infection than the 3.4% SSI rate associated with clean surgical techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Vazquez_x002d_Aragon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez-Aragon 2003</LINK>). A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Pittet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 2005</LINK>) found that women who had been treated for breast cancer and who had immediate reconstruction had a SSI rate of between 0% and 53%, whilst non-cancer patients undergoing the same reconstructive surgery had an average rate of 2.5%. There are several factors that are documented as increasing the risk of infection for surgical patients generally. These include: patient risk factors, e.g. diabetes, obesity or smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>); surgical technique, e.g. aseptic technique (<LINK REF="REF-Ritter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritter 1988</LINK>); and type of surgery, e.g. whether the wound is contaminated (<LINK REF="REF-Gruendemann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruendemann 2001</LINK>). In addition, surgery for breast cancer has several risk factors that make this patient group more susceptible to infection, including use of chemotherapy prior to surgery (neo-adjuvant chemotherapy); technique of diagnostic biopsy; re-operation for recurrence or to achieve better tumour margins; reconstructive surgery with implants and seroma accumulation and drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2003</LINK>). Infection may lead to significant morbidity for the patient, delay in adjuvant treatment, such as radiotherapy, and increased cost of care if the patient requires supplementary treatment due to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Coello-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coello 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pre- and perioperative antibiotics have been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative infection in several patient groups (the term "perioperative" refers to administration between induction of anaesthetic and the patient leaving the recovery room) (<LINK REF="REF-Gruendemann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruendemann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majoribanks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majoribanks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008a</LINK>). In colorectal surgery antibiotic prophylaxis has been found to reduce long and short-term morbidity, decrease length of hospital stay and lower the overall cost of care (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008a</LINK>). However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing infection is still a controversial issue and their routine use is not common in breast cancer surgery. Some feel that a clean surgical procedure should not require prophylactic antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 1994</LINK>) and that the use of pre- or perioperative antibiotics merely masks the symptoms of infection until after the patient is discharged (<LINK REF="STD-Wagman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wagman 1990</LINK>). In addition increased antibiotic use may lead to antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-PHLS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHLS 2000</LINK>) and adverse effects such as clostridium difficile infection that causes gastro-intestinal problems (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008a</LINK>). In order to clarify the situation, this systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of pre- or perioperative antibiotics in reducing the incidence of postoperative infections in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.</P>

<P>For this update two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement was based). We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study. We discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus. We presented assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure, which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

We considered values of I<SUP>2</SUP> over 75% to indicate a high level of heterogeneity and would have resulted in a random-effects model being applied or not pooling results.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2000</LINK>) reported no infections in either group but in the remaining nine trials there were fewer infections in the groups treated with antibiotics, this was statistically significant in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gulluoglu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gulluoglu 2013</LINK>) which considered overweight and obese breast cancer patients. In the other eight trials the results were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition pooling the two studies which compared cefonicid with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bold-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bold 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1990</LINK>) showed a statistically significant reduction in infection associated with preoperative antibiotics (RR 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<P>We pooled all the trials using a fixed-effect model as there was no evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The pooled risk ratio shows that giving preoperative antibiotics significantly reduces the risk of wound infection after breast cancer surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We carried out a sensitivity analysis to exclude one study (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2000</LINK>), as this study had short follow-up, only compared antibiotics with no antibiotic and reported inflammation rather than infection as its primary outcome. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated no effect from removing Chow from the pooled analysis.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bold-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bold 1998</LINK>) documented infection rates in those who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy; there was no statistically significant difference between the groups treated with cefonicid compared with the placebo group (RR 0.21, 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Another study provided details of the number of patients who had previously received chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Platt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1990</LINK>) but did not report separate data on infection rates for these patients.</P>
<P>Since there is evidence that the quality of allocation concealment influences study results (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) we examined the effect of excluding studies judged to have inadequate allocation concealment in a prespecified sensitivity analysis. We judged two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Amland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Amland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2000</LINK>) to have unclear allocation concealment.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-03-04 09:05:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found that preoperative antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of SSI in people undergoing surgery for breast cancer when compared with placebo or no treatment. Of the nine studies that reported data on adverse events only one found an increase of events in the intervention group, however detailed information about the nature of the adverse events was not given and adverse events were generally poorly reported across the included studies. In addition data for some of the outcomes, including deaths, delays in adjuvant cancer treatments, cost and readmissions were reported by few of the included studies. We found one study that evaluated perioperative antibiotics compared with no antibiotic; this small study found that perioperative antibiotics did not significantly reduce the incidence of SSI. We found no studies evaluating antibiotics for breast reconstruction at the time of the initial surgery.</P>
<P>We found one systematic review and meta analysis on the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for breast cancer surgery which also concluded that prophylactic antibiotics reduce SSIs (<LINK REF="REF-Tejirian-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tejirian 2006</LINK>). Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2012</LINK>) also considered non breast cancer patients and concluded that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of SSIs.Two non-systematic reviews (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Amico-2001" TYPE="STUDY">D'Amico 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2000</LINK>) did not draw any firm conclusions. Similar systematic reviews in other types of clean surgery are scarce and have produced varied results (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Manuel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Manuel 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found only eleven studies with a total of 2867 participants; not many considering the number of people affected globally by breast cancer. Whilst it is encouraging that a statistically significant result was found it is possible that the numbers are not adequate to evaluate fully the risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis for breast cancer surgery. In addition, although we found some trials that included people having immediate breast reconstruction we excluded them as we were unable to obtain discrete data specifically for breast cancer patients.</P>
<P>Whilst all efforts were made to obtain unpublished data, all the included studies had been published, therefore there is potential for publication bias. Testing for publication bias was not done due to the small number of studies obtained.</P>
<P>Although there was no statistical heterogeneity only four studies compared the same antibiotic using the same regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Bold-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bold 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabaluna-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cabaluna 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wagman 1990</LINK>), therefore we were unable to make conclusions about the most effective antibiotic and regimen. Other recent research has, however, recommended that antibiotic prophylaxis should generally be administered as a single dose preoperatively in order to maximise benefit and minimise adverse effects from treatment (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general the included trials were at low risk of bias for the main domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment. Three studies had unclear allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Amland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Amland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yetim-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yetim 2010</LINK>) and excluding these studies from the analysis made little difference to the result. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2000</LINK>) had a follow-up of only five days. As the average time to onset of infection in the other included studies ranged between 11 to 17.7 days it may have been appropriate to specify in the protocol a minimum length for follow-up. However, excluding data from this study made no difference to the overall outcomes. However, we judged one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yetim-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Yetim 2010</LINK>) which compared perioperative antibiotics with no antibiotic to be at high risk of bias overall due to a failure of blinding and insufficient information given regarding selection bias.</P>
<P>Overall, there are sufficient data from this review to suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces surgical site infections in those undergoing non-reconstructive breast cancer surgery. However further research would be required to establish the best protocols for practice. </P>

We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format. We combined the EMBASE and CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). We applied no language or date restrictions.</P>

<P>In addition, we screened references in all articles found by the above search strategy for further studies. We contacted experts in the field and interest groups to try and obtain access to unpublished or ongoing work. We followed up conference proceedings and grey literature that was considered to be potentially eligible for inclusion by both authors by contacting the study authors for further information.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
