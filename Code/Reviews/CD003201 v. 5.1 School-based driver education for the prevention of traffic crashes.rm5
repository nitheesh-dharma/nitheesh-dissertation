<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>School based driver education leads to early licensing and may increase road crash rates.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Teenagers have a higher risk of road death and serious injury than any other group. School based driver education has been promoted as a strategy to reduce the number of road crashes involving teenagers. The results of this systematic review show that driver education in schools leads to early licensing. They provide no evidence that driver education reduces road crash involvement, and suggest that it may lead to a modest but potentially important increase in the proportion of teenagers involved in traffic crashes. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In the UK, drivers aged 17 to 21 years make up 7% of licence holders but 13% of drivers involved in road traffic crashes resulting in injury. As in many countries, the UK government has proposed to tackle this problem with driver education programmes in schools and colleges. However, there is a concern that if driver education leads to earlier licensing this could increase the number of teenagers involved in road traffic crashes. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the effect of school-based driver education on licensing and road traffic crashes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, CIG's specialised register, MEDLINE, National Research Register, and the Science &amp; Social Science Citation Index. We also checked reference lists of identified papers and contacted authors and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing school-based driver education to no driver education and assessing the effect on licensing and road traffic crash involvement. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials, conducted between 1982 and 1984, met the inclusion criteria (n=17,965). Two trials examined the effect of driver education on licensing. In the trial by Stock (USA) 87% of students in the driver education group obtained their driving licence as compared to 84.3% in the control group (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05). In the trial by Wynne-Jones (New Zealand) the time from trial enrolment to licensing was 111 days in males receiving driver education compared with 300 days in males who did not receive driver education, and 105 days in females receiving driver education compared with 415 days in females who did not receive driver education. </P>
<P>All three trials examined the effect of driver education on road traffic crashes. In the trial by Strang (Australia), 42% of students in each group had one or more crashes since being licensed (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.23). In the trial by Stock, the number of students involved in one or more crashes as a driver was 27.5% in the driver education group compared to 26.7% in the control group (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09). In the trial by Wynne-Jones, the number of students who experienced crashes was 16% in the driver education group as compared to 14.5% in the control group (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.59). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results show that driver education leads to early licensing. They provide no evidence that driver education reduces road crash involvement, and suggest that it may lead to a modest but potentially important increase in the proportion of teenagers involved in traffic crashes. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-25 17:11:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>In March 2000, the British Government launched its road safety strategy, setting out how it plans to achieve a 40% reduction in road deaths and serious injuries by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-DETR-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DETR 2000</LINK>). Prominent within the strategy is a plan to reduce deaths and serious injuries in teenage drivers. Drivers aged 17 to 21 years make up 7% of licence holders but 13% of drivers involved in road traffic crashes resulting in injury (<LINK REF="REF-DETR-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DETR 2000</LINK>). The British government proposed to tackle the problem of teenage road deaths with driver education programmes in schools and colleges. Students aged 16 to 18 years were offered an education package developed by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), the executive agency of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) responsible for driving tests in Britain and funded from driving test fees (<LINK REF="REF-www.driving_x002d_test.co.uk" TYPE="REFERENCE">www.driving-test.co.uk</LINK>). The DSA Schools Programme involves presentations by driving examiners about selecting a driving instructor, the theory and practical tests, and a range of road safety issues. In the year the policy was announced, driving examiners made 800 presentations to schools and colleges in Britain reaching 125,000 students. In December 2000, Mr Keith Hill, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the DETR, announced an expansion of the programme to reach some 750,000 students (<LINK REF="REF-House-of-Commons" TYPE="REFERENCE">House of Commons</LINK>).</P>
<P>Driver education has a long history as a road safety strategy and considerable effort has been given to evaluating its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Vernick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernick 1999</LINK>). A major concern with driver education is that it might encourage teenagers to obtain a driving licence and start driving sooner than they would in the absence of driver education. Because teenagers have a higher risk of road death and serious injury than any other age group, earlier licensing could offset any beneficial effect of driver education and increase the number of teenage road traffic crashes. To quantify the effect of school driver education on licensing and road traffic crashes we conducted a systematic search for randomised controlled trials. </P>

<P>Note: Search strategies for controlled studies in medical databases can achieve high sensitivity and PPV because terms describing the study methodology are included among the indexing (descriptor) terms. Road safety databases, however, have a very limited range of indexing terms describing the study methodology. Previous work by the Cochrane Injuries Group used word frequency analysis to develop an electronic search strategy of known sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) to identify reports of controlled evaluation studies of road safety interventions in the TRANSPORT database. However, it was found that there are no search terms that combine acceptable sensitivity and positive predictive value. For this reason, we did not include methodological search terms in the search strategy on the TRANSPORT database. Because we could not use methodological indexing terms in the search strategy it was necessary to use terms that restricted the search output to a manageable number of studies. We therefore used terms describing the outcomes of interest. However, the possibility that we would have overlooked studies that did not mention these terms in the abstract or key words is open to question.</P>

<BR/>In this trial on a total of 848 secondary school students, the number of days from trial enrolment until a driving licence was obtained (licensing delay) was significantly shorter in the driver education group. Data on licensing delay were stratified by sex and insufficient information was available in the published report to combine the strata or to calculate the mean difference in licensing delay and its 95% confidence interval. The number of days from trial enrolment to licensing was 111 days in males receiving driver education compared with 300 days in males who did not receive driver education (t=7.19, P&lt;0.001). In females the number of days from trial enrolment to licensing was 105 days in females receiving driver education compared with 415 days in females who did not receive driver education (t=9.88, P&lt;0.001). The number of students who were involved in crashes was 90/561(16%) in students who received driver education as compared to 33/227 (14.5%) in the control group (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.59) . </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is no evidence that driver education reduces teenage involvement in road traffic crashes. Because driver education encourages earlier licensing it may lead to a modest but potentially important increase in the number of teenagers involved in road traffic crashes. The three identified trials of driver education were conducted in Australia, USA and New Zealand, between 1982 and 1984, and it is important to ask whether their results can be generalised to contemporary driver education programmes such as the DSA Schools Programme as proposed by the British government. The DSA programme is much less intensive, the entire presentation lasting only 50 minutes, with no behind the wheel driver training and greater emphasis on taking the driving test. For driver education to be effective in reducing crash involvement, any effect of early licensing must be offset by improved driving skills, if indeed teaching driving skills reduces road crash rates at all (<LINK REF="REF-Gregersen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregersen 1996</LINK>). With its emphasis on the driving test, the DSA programme could easily increase licensing but with little or no impact on driving skills, potentially the worst combination from a road safety perspective. If the DSA programme increased the proportion of licensed teenagers by just 2%, then an additional 27 teenagers might be killed or seriously injured each year as a result of this road safety programme. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results show that driver education in schools leads to early licensing. They provide no evidence that driver education reduces road crash involvement, and suggest that it may lead to a modest but potentially important increase in the proportion of teenagers involved in traffic crashes. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In view of their potential to encourage earlier licensing and thus increase road traffic crash involvement of young drivers, driver education courses should not be offered outside the context of a randomised controlled trial. Future driver education courses should aim to discourage early licensing. </P>
