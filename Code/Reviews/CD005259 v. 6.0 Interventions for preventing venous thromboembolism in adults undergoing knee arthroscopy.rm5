<TITLE>Interventions for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults undergoing knee arthroscopy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:36:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Knee arthroscopy is a common, minimally invasive surgical procedure used both for diagnosis and treatment of knee conditions. It is increasingly carried out in day surgery using various types of anaesthesia. Some people are at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) because of factors including a previous history, immobilization, smoking, obesity, varicose veins and increasing age. Different approaches are available for preventing DVT (thromboprophylaxis), both mechanically and with drug medication. The characteristic symptoms of DVT are limb pain and swelling (edema) but often there are no obvious signs or symptoms. DVT at or above knee level (proximal) is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (which can be fatal) but isolated calf DVT (distal) rarely causes symptoms and is asymptomatic. Arthroscopy patients are often young and soon become mobile again. The incidence of DVT is reported to be from 0.6% when diagnosed clinically to 17.9% using the most sensitive imaging techniques (venography).</P>
<P>This review reports that low molecular weight heparin reduces the incidence of distal DVT diagnosed but the clinical benefits of this are uncertain. The review authors identified four completed studies from three countries that randomly assigned a total of 527 adults to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or no intervention or placebo. The mean age of participants ranged from 31 to 44 years and nearly three quarters were male. The relative risk (RR) of thrombotic events was 0.16 (range 0.05 to 0.52). The number needed to treat to prevent one thrombotic event was 17. All the blood clots were distal and were mainly diagnosed by sonogram. Adverse events were most common in the intervention group. The most common complication was minor bleeding with a RR of 2.23 (range 0.99 to 4.99). The number needed to harm was 20. No completed studies were found that looked at mechanical devices such as graduated elastic stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression, for patients immobilized in bed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Knee arthroscopy is a frequent surgical procedure. Arthroscopy procedures are considered minimally invasive. However, some patients will need extended surgical time, suffer injury and immobilization thus increasing the risk for thromboembolic events. Incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy is reported to be from 0.6% to 17.9% depending on the diagnostic method used. Different approaches are available for thromboprophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacological). </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis to reduce the incidence of DVT in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialized Register (last searched October 2006) the CENTRAL (last searched Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), and Lilacs (1988 to 2006). We contacted specialists known to be involved in phlebology and interested in post thrombotic syndrome for details of unpublished and ongoing trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), whether blinded or not (i.e. double blinded, single blinded or unblinded) of all type of interventions, whether mechanical or pharmacological, single or in combination, used to prevent DVT in males and females over 18 years old undergoing knee arthroscopy. There was no restriction on language. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:44:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Four trials involving 527 predominantly male participants were included. The main weakness of the studies was the lack of correct stratification of the arthroscopic intervention.</P>
<P>The relative risk (RR) of thrombotic events was 0.16 (95% confidence interval (CI); 0.05 to 0.52) comparing any type of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus placebo. All thrombotic events but one (pulmonary embolism in the LMWH group) were distal venous thrombosis. Adverse events were most common in the intervention group than in the control group, RR 2.04 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.44). There were 66 episodes of adverse events. The number needed to harm was 20 for any adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This meta-analysis suggests that LMWH reduces the incidence of distal DVT diagnosed by sonogram. The clinical benefit of this is uncertain. No strong evidence was found to conclude thromboprophylaxis is effective to prevent thromboembolic events and safe, in people with unknown risk factors for thrombosis, undergoing knee arthroscopy. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:53:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot develops within the venous system, typically in the lower limbs. The characteristic symptoms of DVT are limb pain and edema but often there will be no obvious signs or symptoms (asymptomatic DVT). The risk of developing DVT depends on multiple factors including a previous history of DVT, immobilization, smoking, obesity, varicose veins, increasing age, trauma, any hypercoagulable state (increased tendency for the blood to clot), and surgery. Deep vein thrombosis increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) which can be fatal in 20% to 50% of cases, depending on the population. After an episode of PE, 5% of patients have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Hollerwerger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollerwerger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Classically, DVT has been classified as proximal (thrombosis at or above the popliteal vein) and distal, occurring below that level. The distinction is important as while proximal DVT has been clearly shown to increase the risk of pulmonary embolism (50% of people with symptomatic proximal DVT will have PE in lung scans), the clinical relevance of distal DVT is controversial in the literature. The consensus is that isolated calf DVT is rarely symptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2003</LINK>). However, when DVT is both symptomatic and untreated, 25 % of cases may extend to the proximal veins (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2003</LINK> ) and thus increase the incidence of post thrombotic syndrome in the affected leg, characterized by chronic persistent pain, swelling, and other signs in the affected limb, increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, and venous ulcers (5% to 10%) (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2002</LINK>), or result in PE. </P>
<P>Diagnosis of DVT may be difficult in the absence of symptoms and consequently it is often under diagnosed (50 % of DVT cases are asymptomatic) (<LINK REF="REF-Delis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delis 2001</LINK>). Venography (phlebography) is the gold standard diagnostic method for DVT, but it is difficult to justify its use as a screening method in a low-risk population, due to its invasive character. Sonography (ultrasound) is used as a diagnostic method, with the variation in accuracy dependent on the technique used. Higher sensitivity is achieved using duplex (71%) and higher specificity (98%) using compression ultrasound alone (<LINK REF="REF-Goodacre-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodacre 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Orthopedic surgery increases the risk of DVT. Knee arthroscopy is a frequently performed surgical procedure in orthopedics, traditionally carried out on a young population, but the indication for this procedure is now extending to older patients. Increasingly arthroscopy is performed on an outpatient day-case basis with early active/passive mobilization in the rehabilitation programs. Arthroscopically-assisted surgery may be used for the treatment of a variety of pathologies with different technical requirements for example, washout, meniscectomy (removal of fibrocartilage from the knee joint), anterior/posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, lateral release, chondroplasty (repair of cartilage), articular debridement (fibrosis, dead or infected material removal), synovial resection, and tibial plateau fractures. Some of these procedures may be considered minimally-invasive procedures; other procedures require the use of a tourniquet, extended surgical time, and can cause more soft tissue and bone damage. General anesthesia, subarachnoid blockade, femoral blockade, intraarticular or combined anesthesia, may be performed, each carrying independent risks for DVT. The incidence of DVT in patients who undergo venographically-screened, knee arthroscopy, is reported to be as high as 17.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Demers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demers 1998</LINK>). Other studies report the incidence of clinically diagnosed DVT as 0.6 % (<LINK REF="REF-Dahl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 2000</LINK>). If ultrasound is used, the incidence is between 4.1% and 15.6% if ultrasound is used (<LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgeons generally agree that thromboprophylaxis should be used in moderate and high risk patients who undergo surgery. Graduated elastic stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression are mechanical devices used to prevent DVT, the latter often used in patients immobilized in bed. There are different opinions about whether or not prophylaxis should be used in knee arthroscopy, partly reflecting different perceptions of the underlying risk of DVT. </P>

<P>Two studies had acceptable quality standards (<LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK>). Both studies randomized participants although the method of allocation was not reported. Blinding was intended in both studies however <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK> did not report how blinding was secured in those who performed the sonograms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clear as well as the analysis undertaken. <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK> excluded four patients in the control group from the intention-to-treat analysis (not having had tourniquet or general anesthesia or both) and reported to do so "trying to gain homogeneity". Loss of follow up was 8% in the intervention group (5/65) and 2% in the control group (1/64) (<LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>) and 7% of patients withdraw their informed consent in <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Canata-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Canata 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1995</LINK> were the poorest quality trials. In both studies allocation methods and how randomization was achieved were not described. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were not described and intention-to-treat analysis was not done. Adverse event definitions are not clear. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:53:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The relative risk (RR) of thrombotic events (all sites, diagnosed both clinically and by ultrasound) was 0.16 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.52). This RR was obtained through pooling data from the four studies with an overall 527 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Canata-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Canata 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK>) evaluating any LMWH versus 'no treatment' before or after the procedure. In these four studies all but one thrombotic events were distal DVT (one event of pulmonary embolism in <LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Canata-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Canata 2003</LINK> did not report any thrombotic events therefore its RR was not estimable and has no effect on the calculated pooled RR.</P>
<P>Considering all the studies, there were three distal DVT in the LMWH and one PE compared to 20 DVT in those who received 'no treatment'. We did a sensitivity analysis including only higher quality studies and the RR did not change (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61) (<LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK>). The number needed to treat to prevent one thrombotic event was 17.</P>
<P>We intended to extract data only in those episodes of DVT that were first noticed through clinical diagnosis. Only <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2001</LINK> reported this outcome clearly and three patients out of 239 had clinical symptoms of DVT (all in the control group) and the calculated RR was 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.85 P &lt; 0.21).</P>
<P>There was only one episode of PE (in the treatment group) (<LINK REF="STD-Michot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michot 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events were most common in the intervention group than in the control group with a RR 2.04 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.44). There were 66 episodes of any adverse events, including allergies, one patient with transient low levels of platelets, minor gastrointestinal bleeding, two episodes of hemarthrosis in the intervened knee. The most common complication was minor bleeding with a RR of 2.23 (95% CI 1.99 to 4.99). The number needed to harm was 20.</P>
<P>We did not find heterogeneity in any of the comparisons made.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:45:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The RR of distal DVT (combining both clinically and sonogram-diagnosed DVT) comparing LMWH with no intervention for knee arthroscopy was 0.16 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.52) and the RR of any adverse events because of the intervention was RR 2.04 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.44). The RR for clinically relevant thrombosis was not statistically significant. All the thromboses were distal and the majority were diagnosed by sonogram. There was no difference between groups in relation to those DVT that were clinically relevant.</P>
<P>The incidence of DVT during arthroscopy varies from 3.1% to 17.9% in a meta-analysis by Ilahi et al (<LINK REF="REF-Ilahi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilahi 2005</LINK>). However, the question we are looking for an answer to is: what is the clinical relevance of distal thrombosis diagnosed through sonogram? The literature is not conclusive in this area. The incidence of PE in distal asymptomatic DVT varies between 1.6% and 21% (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazmers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazmers 1999</LINK>) and it is probably related to the patient risk factors and type of thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>When performing arthroscopy, we are picturing a usually healthy individual who will undergo a minor intervention. As in any other medical intervention, the risk should outweigh the benefit. We should weigh the risk of having a distal thrombosis with its unpredictable and quite low incidence outcomes against the minor complications caused by LMWH administration (although some may argue that having a "minor" gastrointestinal bleeding or hemarthrosis should not be called "minor" in these patients since both will require intervention). It is difficult with only four studies (and with only two good quality studies) to draw a conclusion. An additional factor that should be taken into account is the cost of treatment.<BR/>
<BR/>According to the results of a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Goodacre-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodacre 2005</LINK>), compression ultrasound seems to be appropriate as a screening method in this low risk population where high specificity is required to avoid false positive results.</P>
<P>The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) (17) relates to asymptomatic DVT, and the number needed to harm (NNTH) (20) is about a clinical event. Assuming a ratio of asymptomatic distal DVT to clinically apparent DVT of 1:10 to 1:20, the NNTB to prevent a clinical event would range from 170 to 340, with 8.5 to 17 times as frequent as harm occurring.</P>
<P>We conclude that the physician needs to discuss these benefits and possible complications with the patient until new studies are performed. It is essential that future studies stratify patients according to their risk factors, and also stratify arthroscopic procedures.</P>
<P>Since knee arthroscopy is a widely-used method and each center may have its own guidelines on procedures, it would be helpful to set up surveillance methods in each center to detect either adverse events or thrombotic events, with and without the use of LMWH. Future epidemiological studies as well as clinical trials will be needed to assess the natural history of non-clinical distal DVT in these patients.</P>
<P>Studies should be carried out to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical methods in knee arthroscopy for the prevention of thrombotic events.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-05 11:15:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-05 11:15:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The meta-analysis showed a reduction in the number of distal thrombosis diagnosed through sonogram. </P>
<P>Although this review suggests that some benefit may be obtained from prophylaxis, we considered only two studies to be of adequate methodological quality with small sample size, and poorly defined or stratified in their arthroscopic intervention. No studies on mechanical devices alone were found, other than the ongoing combined protocol (Camporese 2003a). </P>
<P>No strong evidence was found to conclude thromboprophylaxis is effective in preventing thromboembolic events in people undergoing knee arthroscopy with unknown risk factors for DVT.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Arthroscopic surgery includes different types of interventions with different operation times, techniques, injury, recovery time, and return to activity. </P>
<P>Future studies need to stratify patients according to their risk factors, and type of arthroscopic procedure. Surveillance studies will be important to assess the detection of both adverse events and thrombotic events, with and without the use of LMWH.</P>
