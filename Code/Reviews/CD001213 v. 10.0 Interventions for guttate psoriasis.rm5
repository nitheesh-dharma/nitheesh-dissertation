<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:48:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">Treatments for guttate psoriasis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes scaly pink patches. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of the disease that usually affects children and young adults. It can happen on its own, or as a complication of ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis. Often, it follows a bacterial throat infection or tonsillitis. Antibiotics and tonsillectomy as treatments for guttate psoriasis are covered by another review. This review could find no evidence, from trials, about the effects of any other commonly used treatments for guttate psoriasis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive acute form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. Very little specific evidence-based guidance is available in standard texts to help make rational decisions about treatment options.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of treatments for guttate psoriasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 1999), Medline (1966- September 1999), Embase (1988-September 1999), Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials (to November 1999) and European Dermato-Epidemiology Network (EDEN) Psoriasis Trials Database (to November 1999) for terms GUTTATE and PSORIASIS. We also searched 100 unselected RCTs of psoriasis therapy and all 112 RCTs of phototherapy for psoriasis in the Salford Database of Psoriasis Trials for separate stratification for guttate psoriasis. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials in which patients with acute guttate psoriasis were randomised to different treatments, except those trials examining antistreptococcal interventions which are addressed in a separate Cochrane review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No published report could be found to support or to challenge current commonly used methods of management.</P>
<P>Only one trial which met the selection criteria was identified. In this small study of 21 hospitalised patients with guttate psoriasis, intravenous infusion of an n-3 fatty acid rich lipid emulsion was compared with placebo emulsion containing n-6 fatty acids. The n-3 preparation appeared to be of some benefit for patients with guttate psoriasis. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently no firm evidence on which to base treatment of acute guttate psoriasis. Studies comparing standard treatment modalities, including phototherapy and topical regimens, are required to enable informed decisions on treatment choices to be made.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:49:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:49:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Guttate psoriasis is a distinctive form of psoriasis which characteristically occurs in children and young adults. It may arise on its own (acute guttate psoriasis) or may complicate existing, often quite limited, chronic plaque psoriasis (guttate flare of chronic psoriasis).</P>
<P>It is strongly associated with preceding or concurrent streptococcal infection, evidence of which can be found in a majority of affected patients (<LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1992</LINK>). Typically, showers of tiny red papules (likened to rain-drops or guttate) erupt over large areas of the skin surface one to two weeks after an episode of acute tonsillitis. In the early stages before the typical scale has had a chance to develop, guttate psoriasis can be mistaken for a drug eruption especially in people given an antibiotic for the associated streptococcal infection. The true diagnosis, which is a clinical one, soon becomes apparent as characteristic psoriatic scaling develops on the surface of the papules. Guttate psoriasis may be itchy and may have a profound effect on self-esteem, especially in the psychologically vulnerable age group in which it most commonly occurs.</P>
<P>If left untreated, guttate psoriasis may clear spontaneously or may develop into chronic plaque psoriasis. Either form may recur although the risk is not well defined (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:49:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There is no consensus on the best treatment for guttate psoriasis. Commonly, various forms of tar are applied topically in conjunction with ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy. Anthralin (dithranol) and topical corticosteroids may also be used (with or without UVB phototherapy). Other forms of phototherapy used include narrow-band UVB, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and psoralen bath PUVA (all with or without the oral retinoid, acitretin or, formerly, etretinate). More recently vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) have been introduced for treating psoriasis and are used by some dermatologists for guttate psoriasis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:49:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In view of the associated streptococcal infection some dermatologists advocate the use of antibiotic therapy or tonsillectomy. The optimal method for achieving clearance of guttate psoriasis is not known. Furthermore it is not clear whether any interventions can effectively prolong the duration of remission or prevent progression to chronic plaque psoriasis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There is remarkably little guidance in standard texts as to how this distinctive form of psoriasis should be treated and whether it should be managed differently from chronic plaque psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Camp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camp 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions aimed at treating or preventing the associated streptococcal infection are addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2000</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:08:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There is no information as to what percentage reduction in psoriasis severity score is perceived by people with psoriasis as being "worthwhile". It may be possible to achieve a modest reduction in objective psoriasis severity score which, whilst achieving statistical significance, does not have a significant impact on either the patient's or the physician's perception of overall disease severity. There is enormous variation between patients in their perceptions of what constitutes a satisfactory response to treatment. Guttate psoriasis is a condition where near complete clearance of disease may be expected in a majority of treated patients. Therefore, where scores were given, a relative treatment difference of at least 50% for comparison between active treatment versus placebo, or at least 20% between two or more active treatments was accepted as being the minimum clinically meaningful change. (These figures were derived by discussion within the Cochrane Skin Group.)</P>
<P>The nominated primary outcome measures agreed in consultation with the Group were thus:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Improvement or clearance of psoriasis as measured by reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score or other objective semi-quantitative measure of disease severity</LI>
<LI>Reduction in patients' self-assessed (or parent/guardian-assessed) psoriasis severity scores over the time course of the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Improvement in patient satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures over the time course of the intervention.</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:07:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The single study which was found (<LINK REF="STD-Grimminger-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Grimminger 1993</LINK>) was not designed to compare established methods of treating guttate psoriasis but was intended to test the hypothesis that fish oil-derived n-3 fatty acids might be beneficial for acute guttate psoriasis. Furthermore, only adults (mean age 39.7 years) were recruited and it was thus not representative of acute guttate psoriasis, a disease seen mainly in children and young adults. It is of theoretical interest that this trial appeared to show benefit from treatment with intravenous n-3 fatty acids but, when costs of hospitalisation and inconvenience to the patient are considered, it is clear that this cannot be recommended in the routine management of guttate psoriasis. It is known that fish oil exerts a mild beneficial effect in chronic plaque psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Bittiner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittiner 1988</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1989</LINK>) and it is certainly possible that the effects may be more pronounced in acutely flaring psoriasis. It might be appropriate to look at the effects of oral n-3 fatty acids in patients with acute guttate psoriasis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Despite the fact that the appearance and clinical course of guttate psoriasis is known to differ from that of chronic plaque psoriasis, many studies treat patients with these diseases as one group. Although there are studies that include patients with guttate psoriasis, they are seldom stratified separately to different treatment groups. To give an example, a study examining various forms of phototherapy and systemic retinoids (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1992</LINK>) recruited 45 patients with chronic plaque or guttate psoriasis and allocated each to one of three treatment groups. From the report it was impossible to determine how many patients had guttate psoriasis or into which group they had been allocated. We looked very carefully for studies in which patients with guttate psoriasis were randomised to receive different treatments but were unable to identify any study in which treatments in common use for acute guttate psoriasis were compared. It is possible that some RCTs of treatments for psoriasis may have contained subgroups in which patients with acute guttate psoriasis were independently randomised and evaluated, but scrutiny of 100 unselected psoriasis trials failed to uncover any such study. Furthermore we were unable to detect any such study in an extensive departmental database of psoriasis trials which had been methodically tagged by keywords including "guttate psoriasis". As an additional check, we read all 112 trials of phototherapy for psoriasis (UVB or Psoralen plus UVA) in our database, since these were the studies where one might have expected patients with guttate psoriasis to be represented. One large study of 1308 patients receiving PUVA therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Melski-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Melski 1977</LINK>) did include over 120 patients with guttate psoriasis but, although response to treatment in the guttate group was evaluated separately, the allocation of these patients to different treatment groups was not stratified.</P>
<P>It is surprising that there appears to have been virtually no research into the treatment of a relatively common and well-defined entity. There is no firm evidence to guide physicians treating patients with acute guttate psoriasis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:08:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There is a requirement for the most basic of questions to be addressed.</P>
<P>How do standard topical therapies (e.g. tar, topical corticosteroids, anthralin) compare with vehicle alone or newer therapies (e.g. vitamin D analogues)?</P>
<P>What is the role of phototherapy in acute guttate psoriasis? Which modality should be used? Should it be broad-band or narrow-band UVB? Is there a place for photochemotherapy (oral or bath psoralens with ultraviolet light A)?</P>
<P>Should topical therapy be administered in conjunction with phototherapy and, if so, what is the optimal regimen?</P>
<P>Is there a role for systemic retinoid therapy?</P>
<P>Can any intervention prolong the duration of remission from guttate psoriasis or prevent progression to chronic plaque psoriasis?</P>
<P>We suggest that the most pressing priorities are as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Comparison of tar alone, topical corticosteroid alone, calcipotriol alone and vehicle alone</LI>
<LI>Comparison of the two most effective of the treatments from above study with UVB</LI>
</OL>
<P>thus: best treatment alone, best treatment + UVB, next best treatment + UVB, vehicle + UVB</P>
<P>In view of the apparent benefit of intravenous n-3 fatty acids in acute guttate psoriasis and the known mild beneficial effects of oral fish oil in chronic plaque psoriasis, it would also be worth performing a study comparing oral fish oil against placebo oil in acute guttate psoriasis.<BR/>
<BR/>It is also important to examine the place of antibiotic therapy in patients with guttate psoriasis and tonsillectomy for those with recurrent attacks. This is addressed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2000</LINK>).</P>
