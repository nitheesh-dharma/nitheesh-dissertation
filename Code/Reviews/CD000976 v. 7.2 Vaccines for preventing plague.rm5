<P>Plague is a rare disease now, but can be life threatening. It is transmitted by fleas and related to rat infestation. There are different forms of the disease, but they can all lead to blood poisoning and to death, although antibiotics are effective against the bacterium that causes it. Vaccines are available for use in laboratory staff working on the disease; however when the authors searched the literature they found no studies of sufficient quality to be included in this review. We therefore cannot make confident decisions about the effectiveness or tolerability of any plague vaccines.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The disease</HEADING>
<P>Plague is a serious life threatening bacterial disease, caused by the bacterium <I>Yersinia pestis</I>. Both bubonic plague (infected lumps under the skin), and pneumonic plague can lead to septicaemia (blood poisoning) and death.</P>
<P>The disease is transmitted by flea bites, usually from the rat, and has a short incubation period (1 to 7 days). The reservoir of infection is the Black Rat (Rattus), small rodents and other animals. Although untreated plague has a high mortality rate, <I>Y. pestis</I> remains highly sensitive to antibiotic action. Apart from the great epidemics of history, which have made plague a famous disease, in this century plague activity has consisted of focal, sporadic disease with a variable distribution of carriers. Outbreaks of the disease have been confined to the developing world (Mozambique, Peru, India, Zaire) and are associated with deprivation, overcrowding and low standards of housing where rats and vectors can proliferate. Plague is endemic in China, Mongolia, Burma, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, large parts of Southern Africa, the United States and South America (<LINK REF="REF-Gage-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gage 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Vaccines</HEADING>
<P>Yersin produced the first vaccine in 1896 using horse serum from animals immunised with plague bacilli. There are three contemporary producers of plague vaccines known to us:</P>
<P>1. Aerosol vaccines (from former USSR State manufacturers)</P>
<P>This is a live avirulent EV76 strain vaccine, produced in many centres in the former USSR, which has been in use since 1908, has apparently recently been used for mass immunisation of large parts of the Indian population, is theoretically thought to be capable of reverting to full virulence after administration. Assessment of effectiveness of both human vaccines is fraught with ethical and practical difficulties. For example live attenuated vaccines are thought to be less effective but have a lower incidence of side effects. However we were unable to locate a summary of evidence of such issues. EV76 can be administered as an aerosol or subcutaneously.</P>
<P>2. Formalin inactivated vaccines (<LINK REF="STD-Greer" TYPE="STUDY">Greer</LINK> Laboratories Inc, North Carolina).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Greer" TYPE="STUDY">Greer</LINK> vaccine (USP) (formerly produced by Cutter Biological Ltd in the USA) is a formalin-inactivated vaccine which is thought to confer protection against bubonic but not pneumonic plague for several months after injection. Production of the vaccine has been bedevilled by the relatively high production cost, the need for protection of operators, and its reportedly high systemic side-effects (in one series, 30% of vaccinees) (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1974</LINK>). Overall effectiveness assessment of this vaccine is based on observations such as the one carried out by Cavanaugh and colleagues in US troops deployed during the Vietnam war. Between 1961 and 1971 eight cases were diagnosed among vaccinated US troops (a rate of one case per 1,000,000 man-years of exposure) whereas the equivalent rate for the unvaccinated Vietnamese population was estimated as 333 (<LINK REF="REF-Cavanaugh-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavanaugh 1974</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Greer" TYPE="STUDY">Greer</LINK> vaccine costs $150 for a 20ml bottle (sufficient for fourteen first courses and two boosters) and is administered with three intramuscular injections (0, 3 and 9 months). This amounts to a cost of $10.72 per person vaccinated. The company have produced unpublished data, from a collaborative study with the US military, that their present vaccine has no different immunogenic or reactogenic properties, as measured by the Mouse Potency Index (MPI), from the original Cutter product.</P>
<P>3. Heat killed organisms (CSL Ltd, Victoria Australia).</P>
<P>The CSL vaccine which costs £8 for a 0.5 ml vial is made up of a suspension of heat-killed organisms of <I>Y. pestis</I> in saline with phenol used as an antiseptic (<LINK REF="REF-CSL-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSL 1992</LINK>). The vaccine is administered subcutaneously in three doses at 1-4 week intervals. Booster doses are necessary every six months.</P>
<P>There are at present no candidates for a synthetic vaccine, although there are several reasons why a new vaccine should be developed. These include a reputedly high level of side-effects and short-lived immunity and apparent lack of protection against pneumonic plague by current vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1997</LINK>). Additionally no review of the experimental evidence of the effects of plague vaccines exists, and their role in controlling outbreaks of the disease in endemic countries is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of observational data</HEADING>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966-96) and EMBASE (1985-96) on plague and vaccine in a retrieval strategy identical to the "search strategy for identification of studies" except we did not restrict it to randomised comparisons. All studies identified were observational, and there were no comparators or the comparators were not clear. As none of these studies met the inclusion criteria, we have summarised the findings they report in the following paragraph. Information about each individual study is contained in the excluded trials section of this review.</P>
<P>The excluded studies deal with aspects of the efficiency and safety of different vaccines (live attenuated, freeze-dried, and F1 fraction). Means of administration vary from oral to nebulised, subcutaneous and intramuscular. The F1 fraction vaccine appears to have low efficacy (below 60%) and high systemic side-effects (35% of vaccinees). The attenuated vaccine given through the oral route appears to have similar lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Vorob_x0027_ev" TYPE="STUDY">Vorob'ev</LINK>). Live attenuated vaccines delivered by aerosol have low efficacy and low side-effects, while if delivered by intramuscular or intradermal administration they appear to have efficacy of between 82 to 90% but a high increase of local (38-98%) and systemic (38.4-90%) side-effects. Killed vaccines appear to have the best combination between efficacy (86%) and side-effects. Local side-effects range between 29 and 50% with short term systemic side-effects of up to 20% incidence. Given the non-randomized, uncontrolled and unblinded nature of the data, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. The only controlled cohort study we identified (<LINK REF="STD-Otten-2" TYPE="STUDY">Otten 2</LINK>), dating from the 1930s, indicates high effectiveness of the attenuated vaccine in preventing intra-epidemic mortality.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The lack of trial evidence, or at least of good observational evidence, on the effects of plague vaccine is disconcerting, given the burden of the disease in endemic countries. Additionally, the evidence we have collected is of apparent low quality, judged by today's standards. The highly variable quality of the reports makes interpretation of their content very difficult. </P>
<P>In general, there seems to be reasonable circumstantial evidence that killed and attenuated vaccines afford protection against bubonic plague, but at the cost of frequent short-term side-effects, especially in the case of the latter vaccine. In general cutaneously administered vaccines appear to have a higher incidence of side-effects than their nebulised counterparts but are considerably more effective. Long term side-effects remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the vaccines in protecting against morbidity and mortality given the high reliance on serological changes as an outcome and the certain widespread presence of confounders and biases in the studies. Serological changes are the first basic level of evidence, however, we believe that properly designed, conducted and reported trials of plague vaccines are now overdue and our review highlights this necessity. </P>
<P>Both the <LINK REF="STD-Greer" TYPE="STUDY">Greer</LINK> and CSL vaccines are expensive and apparently available in small quantities, limiting their use in epidemic circumstances. Overall, the use of such vaccines in potentially exposed populations will depend on circumstances, but on the basis of the current evidence it is difficult to formulate firm conclusions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-08 17:42:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Confident decisions on effectiveness of any plague vaccine, relative effectiveness between vaccines, and tolerability cannot be made based on reliable evidence.</P>
<P>Circumstantial data from observational studies suggest that killed types maybe more effective and have fewer side-effects than attenuated types, and this requires additional research. No evidence appears to exist on the long-term side-effects of all types of plague vaccines.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-08 17:42:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Plague is a disease of low incidence and high mortality with a social stigma image and supposed military importance which in the past has led to lack of collaboration and publication of studies. Thus there are three principal themes for research:</P>
<P>Firstly, there is an urgent requirement for well-designed field evaluation of current vaccines, especially the killed version which may be safer. Ideally a new vaccine should also be developed, perhaps using recombinant technology, which could address the problems of side-effects as well as the pneumonic variant of the disease; but a drive to achieve this should not inhibit proper evaluation of existing licensed products. The following questions may be worth testing or exploring when designing the trial:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Are the high levels of local and systemic side-effects with attenuated vaccines borne out in randomised comparisons?</LI>
<LI>Do attenuated vaccines given by aerosol have low immunogenicity?</LI>
<LI>Are killed vaccines more immunogenic than attenuated vaccines?</LI>
<LI>Do killed vaccines have fewer side-effects than attenuated vaccines?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Secondly, field evaluation faces several hurdles whether it is examining present or emerging vaccines. Probably the first methodological step in designing further trials is to have consensus on outcome measures so that comparisons could be facilitated between trials. Although not fully validated, the Mouse Potency Index could be one such measure together with surveillance outcomes (such as the reduction in cases and deaths). Additionally, each available vaccine (predominantly the killed or inactivated Y. pestis) and possibly those that are not commonly used (e.g.Tjiwidej attenuated strain) should be subject to the same outcome measures to allow comparisons. The process of trial design should also take into consideration the need for prevention in outbreaks and therefore incorporate an abbreviated vaccine schedule in its protocol.</P>
<P>Thirdly, central coordination is needed to achieve comparable outcome measures, thus international collaboration is the key feature of future plague vaccine endeavours. It is likely that leadership would come from a significant stake holder, such as the military, and could involve those countries where plague is endemic with a recent history of epidemics.</P>

<P>INTERVENTIONS:<BR/>- Type of vaccine(s): Fraction I antigen<BR/>- Route: Letterman Army Hospital - subcutaneous; revaccination was intracutaneous, subcutaneous or intramuscular. San Quentin Prison - subcutaneous, intracutaneous or intramuscular<BR/>- Schedule: Letterman Army Hospital - Group I: 3 doses, total of 3.0 mg Fraction I antigen (precise regimen not stated). Group II: 3 doses, total of 12.0 mg Fraction I antigen. Revaccination: groups further divided into 3 subgroups to receive 0.2 mg (intracutaneously), 1.0 mg (subcutaneously) or 1.0 mg (intramuscularly). San Quentin Prison - Group III: (1st and 2nd doses) Fraction 1 antigen and typhoid vaccine, (3rd dose) Fraction I antigen, total of 3.0 mg Fraction I antigen. Group IV: (1st dose) Typhoid vaccine only, (2nd and 3rd doses) Fraction I antigen only, total of 2 mg Fraction I antigen. Group V: total of 3.0 mg Fraction I antigen given in three doses intracutaneously. Group VI: Total of 3.0 mg Fraction I antigen with alum in three doses intramuscularly</P>
<P>OUTCOMES:<BR/>- Stated conclusions: The sc administration of 3 mg of FI, either alone or in the reconstituting medium for lyophilized typhoid vaccine, stimulates significant serologic response in approximately two-thirds of those inoculated. The immunity so produced persists for approximately three months. Revaccination with FI at this time raises the mouse protective antibodies in nearly 95% of previously immunized individuals to levels rarely encountered in plague vaccine studies along similar lines. The antigenic FI is, however, an allergen and may cause delayed allergic reactions<BR/>- Estimates of efficacy: Letterman Army Hospital - 30 days after last dose of initial series only 60% of the volunteers had protective antibodies of significant concentration in their sera. Irrespective of the size of the dose, the immunity reflected in antibody levels is considered inadequate in the light of comparative tests on laboratory animals. Both groups responded effectively to small booster inoculations. In fact, only one man failed to respond. San Quentin Prison - Fraction I antigen in a dose of 3 mg, stimulated protective antibodies in 50-62% of those inoculated. A two-dose inoculation (group IV) was definitely less immunogenic, and in group VI the addition of alum failed to improve the antigen stimulus. Furthermore, im inoculation (group VI) favours rapid absorption and removal of FI, and a significant antibody response was recorded in only one-third of the group.<BR/>- Estimates of safety: Letterman Army Hospital - Group I: 11/31 had reactions; and 11/31 had severe reactions. Group II: 14/25 had severe reactions. San Quentin Prison - No severe local or systemic reactions out of 67 participants in four groups.</P>

<P>OUTCOMES:<BR/>- Stated conclusions: In the standardised mouse protection test, two broth cultures of virulent Y pestis 195/P killed with formalin (the so-called new and old Haffkine vaccines), examined independently in two laboratories, were proven to have the same protective efficacy. However, accurate assessment of the serologic response to these vaccines (in particular, the MPI values after primary and booster inoculations in men not previously vaccinated) suggests that the new vaccine may be superior to the old in antigenicity. The freeze-dried USP vaccine as a booster antigen stimulated significant MPI in previously vaccinated humans. In all but two of those not previously inoculated, the response was modest. As a result of the above studies, it is possible to venture the opinion that the new type of Haffkine plague vaccine is a superior plague vaccine in terms of antigenicity in man. Vaccinations performed according to current recommendations are well tolerated and induce the appearance of significant levels of antibody in most subjects<BR/>- Estimates of efficacy: Indirect HA antibody was detected in the sera of all subjects vaccinated with the old or the new type of Haffkine vaccine. Old Haffkine vaccine: MPI of significance appeared in 3/12 on day 30 and 3/13 on day 90.
