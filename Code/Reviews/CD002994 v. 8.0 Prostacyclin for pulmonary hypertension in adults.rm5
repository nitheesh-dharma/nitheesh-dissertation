I am not familiar with all the measures used here so will need guidance as to which ones have been entered as negative figures please! If you tell me which outcomes are better for higher figures (such as FEV1) then I can reverse these for you. Please see the results section below however as there is a mismatch between what is in Metaview and reported in the text and this needs sorting out first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: - &lt;br&gt;Abstract : Results ends &amp;quot;One study (n = 14) showed no difference in DLCO and VC with Iloprost infusion and there were no differences between different positions. &amp;quot; I do not understand this statement.&lt;br&gt;RESULTS : &lt;br&gt;Is there a primary outcome for this treatment and is it one that makes a difference to the patients (not just a measurement on a machine)?&lt;br&gt;Exercise Capacity - I cannot reconcile the reported results in the text and the group results in Metaview, including the reported weights. How do these fit together please? &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; The change scores produced p values in the prostacyclin group equivalent to 0.01 and in the conventional therapy group to 0.02. &amp;quot; In general the p values for each arm of the trial are not relevant, only the value for the difference between arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAP etc&lt;br&gt;The WMD needs to be given units for the pooled results. Please remove comments on p values of individual trial arms as above (also in systemic oxygen transport).&lt;br&gt;LUNG FUNCTION - perhaps this section could be labelled more clearly to show that it relates to a separate trial on ILOPROST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluded studies - strictly only a short note on each study is needed to explain the reason for exclusion in the table of excluded studies. These results may however add a further dimension to the RCT results. See what Paul thinks about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;Bias can be a problem with subjective outcomes but surely is less of an issue with mortality for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL response to technical editing comments 18/12/01:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the above comments Chris. We have made amendments accordingly - contributions entered, and I have swapped the axes for high score/better health outcomes. However, I have left change scores as they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mortality may be a hard outcome, we have had to adopt a cautious approach to the findings on this measure. The Barst study identifed a confounding factor which should temper the message of the review with regard to survival. 8 participants died, all allocated to a non-placebo control, all had significantly lower exercise capacity at outset - on top of this there were no deaths in the prostacyclin group. The other studies had non-significant results, but the overall summary statistic with Peto OR favoured prostacyclin. This has been explained in the results section, and we have reported p values for random effects modelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4/1/02&lt;br&gt;Toby could you make clear on the Outcome titles which ones relate to change scores. From the graph labels it looks as if cardiac index, arterial saturation and oxygen transport may be change scores as the graph labels indicate treatment is better on the left?&lt;br&gt;I have removed the p values for the pooled results as they do not contribute anything extra when the confidence intervals are reported (and I think this is our usual policy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7/1/02&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your input again Chris - I have amended the excluded study's characteristics, and I have added the change score labels to appropriate outcomes. I have also switched the axes on the systemic o2 transport screen to reflect the fact that higher is positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8/1/02 Labels are all now tidy and in the correct directions. SMD and walking distance discussed with Toby and Paul (leave as SMD but comment in the results on the WMD). The results text has been tidied up and the Walking distance corrected for the placebo group in the Rubin trial. Paul has asked for the data from the NYHA to be entered the other way around and reported in the text as OR with NNT and comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22/01 NyHA results are now correctly entered, with an NNT which is correct. 90 metres added as difference in 6 minute walks. Fine to go to Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;29/1 Synopsis simplified after comments from consumer:&lt;br&gt;Prostacyclin may benefit patients with pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the lungs) on a short term basis; however longer term studies are required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension occurs when blood is pumped through arteries in the lungs at an increased pressure. The condition can lead to heart failure and death. Once the diagnosis is made, life expectancy ranges from a few months to a few years. Most current treatments apart from transplantation do not improve survival. Over an 8-12 week period prostacyclin improved exercise capacity and some measures of blood flow when given intravenously to patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension. However, there can be serious side effects as the drug has to be given continuously via a pump into a catheter which has been placed into a central vein. It is not clear how long the drug continues to confer benefit without serious side-effects. Prostacyclins give by mouth or through an inhaler are also available but there is no evidence about how well the treatment works when given this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now ready for Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version sent to SP 30/05/02. Do not delete this line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11_10_02 Updated version for review by CJC.&lt;br&gt;Please enter the names of the 3 new trials in the What's new section and perhaps clarify which route is used in each? I notice that no data from the 3 new studies has been put into Metaview. Has this been overlooked? I assume that there were no changes in the existing outcomes and results so I have not rechecked these.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;14_10_2002. TJL: &lt;br&gt;Thanks Chris - the studies recruited mixed populations and as the subgroup analysis we selected was primary and secondary PH, we could not get access to the data we needed which was more discreet than that offered in the published trials. We have asked the study authors for separate data, although we are not terribly hopeful. I have added this to the results section. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no changes to the previously published meta-analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22/10/2002&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making this clear Toby - I am happy for this to go on to Paul now.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search strategy section &amp;amp; references checked 3/2/05 Liz&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Prostacyclin for pulmonary hypertension in adults UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-03-30 14:48:44 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Paolo Rosati" REVIEW_NO="PRO-OTH" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Prostacyclin may benefit patients with pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the lungs) in the short term but studies longer in duration are required. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when blood is pumped through arteries in the lungs at an increased pressure. The condition can lead to heart failure and death. Once the diagnosis is made, life expectancy ranges from a few months to a few years. Most current treatments apart from lung transplantation do not improve survival. Over an 8-12 week period prostacyclin improved exercise capacity and some measures of blood flow when given intravenously or via injection to patients with pulmonary hypertension. However, with intravenous administration there can be serious side effects as the drug has to be given continuously via a pump into a catheter placed into a central vein. It is not clear how long the drug continues to confer benefit without serious side effects. Prostacyclin can also be given by mouth, under the skin or through an inhaler. These forms of administration may be safer than intravenous prostacyclin and there is evidence that these may be effective in the short term.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is progressive, resulting in right ventricular failure. Pulmonary hypertension can be idiopathic or associated with other conditions. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and can be given orally, subcutaneously, intravenously or inhaled via a nebuliser. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of prostacyclin or one of its analogues in idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches were carried out in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMABSE with pre-specified terms. Searches were current as of July 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Two reviewers selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with pulmonary hypertension for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study quality was assessed and data extracted independently by two reviewers. Outcomes were analysed as continuous and dichotomous outcomes. We sub-grouped data where possible by aetiology of PH (PPH, PH secondary to connective tissue disorder or mixed populations).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine RCTs of mixed duration (3 days-52 weeks), recruiting 1175 participants were included (NYHA functional classes II-IV). <B>
<U>Intravenous prostacyclin versus usual care (four studies)</U>
</B>
<U>:</U> There were significant improvements in exercise capacity of around 90 metres, cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and NYHA functional class over 3 days-12 weeks. Effects were consistent in primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. <B>
<U>Oral prostacyclin versus placebo (two studies)</U>
</B>
<U>:</U> Short-term data (3-6 months) indicated that there was a significant improvement in exercise capacity, but data from one study of 52 weeks reported no significant difference at 12 months. No significant differences were observed for any other outcome. <B>
<U>Subcutaneous treprostinil versus placebo (two studies, 8-12 weeks):</U>
</B>
<B> </B>One large study reported a significant median improvement in exercise capacity of around 16 metres. Cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and symptom scores favoured treprostinil. Infusion site pain and withdrawals due to adverse events were more frequent with treprostinil. <B>
<U>Inhaled prostacyclin versus placebo (one study, 12 weeks):</U>
</B>
<B> </B>There was a significant increase in exercise capacity of approximately 36 metres. Treatment led to better symptom scores and functional class status than with placebo. Subgroup analyses reported by individual studies showed a better exercise capacity in participants with PPH, than those participants with PH secondary to other diseases. Side effects and adverse events were common in the studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that intravenous prostacyclin in addition to conventional therapy at tolerable doses optimised by titration, can confer some short-term benefits (up to 12 weeks of treatment) in exercise capacity, NYHA functional class and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics. There is also some evidence that patients with more severe disease based upon NYHA functional class showed a greater response to treatment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-20 12:46:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and often fatal disease. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can be idiopathic or can be associated with collagen vascular diseases. It is common in scleroderma, especially in limited scleroderma (CREST) and in overlap syndromes. The pulmonary hypertension in connective tissue disorders can occur either directly or secondary to pulmonary fibrosis and right heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Brundage-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brundage 1990</LINK>). Pulmonary vascular disease in the connective tissue diseases can also include pulmonary vasculitis, thromboembolism or pulmonary artery aneurysm (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Pulmonary hypertension also occurs in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and rarely in rheumatoid arthritis and Sjorgrens syndrome. It can occur secondary to interstitial lung diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease, left ventricular failure, congenital heart disease and thromboembolic disease. </P>
<P>Pulmonary hypertension is characterised by progressive elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), leading to hypoxaemia (ventilation/perfusion mismatching), right ventricular failure and death. The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension is unknown but pulmonary vaso-constriction, in-situ thrombosis and endothelial injury may all be important (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1997</LINK>). There is some evidence that there may be a lack of endogenous prostacyclin production in idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Christman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loscalzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loscalzo 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Some studies suggest that primary pulmonary hypertension may occur in up to 33 % of patients with diffuse scleroderma and in 10-50% of those with the CREST syndrome, characterised by calcinosis, Raynaud's syndrome, oesophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia (<LINK REF="REF-Stupi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stupi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ungerer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ungerer 1983</LINK>). Pulmonary hypertension can be a leading cause of death in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Salerni-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salerni 1977</LINK>). Histological evidence of pulmonary vasculopathy has been seen in 65 % of patients with CREST (<LINK REF="REF-Yousem-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yousem 1990</LINK>) although less than 10 % develop clinically overt pulmonary hypertension during life (<LINK REF="REF-Stupi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stupi 1986</LINK>). These estimates depend on the diagnostic methods used. Limited scleroderma (CREST) is associated with anti centromere antibodies (ACA) in 60% of cases whereas diffuse scleroderma is associated with SCL 70 antibodies in 40% of cases. The main histological finding in scleroderma is concentric arteriolar fibrosis with ablation of the intima and media. In idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension there are plexiform lesions and fibrinoid necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2000</LINK>). It has been argued that recurrent episodes of pulmonary vasospasm may occur in scleroderma (pulmonary Raynaud's phenomenon) resulting in irreversible changes to the pulmonary artery (<LINK REF="REF-Robin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furst-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furst 1981</LINK>). </P>
<P>Once the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension is established, life expectancy is greatly reduced. The median survival of patients with NYHA functional classes one and two is six years, two and a half years for NYHA functional class three and only six months for NYHA functional class four (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1991</LINK>). No conventional therapies have proven to be effective for pulmonary hypertension apart from transplantation although this is contraindicated in connective tissue diseases in most transplant programmes as there are complications due to multiple organ involvement. </P>
<P>Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring prostanoid produced from arachidonic acid by vascular endothelium that has vasodilating, antiplatelet aggregating and cytoprotective effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moncada-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncada 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). Epoprostenol is a preparation that can only be given intravenously. It has to be stored in the fridge, prepared daily in sterile conditions and can only be put into a central vein. As it has a short half-life, it has to be given continuously. Iloprost is a chemically stable derivative of prostacyclin with similar biologic properties but with a longer half -life of 13 minutes and can be given orally, as an infusion (either intravenously or subcutaneously) or in the nebulised form. It is pharmacologically equivalent to epoprostenol but as it is more stable, treatment at home is more practicable. Treprostinil is a stable prostacyclin analogue which has similar pharmacological actions to epoprostenol, but is chemically stable at room temperature and has a longer half life of three to four hours. It can therefore be given subcutaneously as a continuous infusion. Beraprost sodium is the first chemically stable and orally active prostacyclin analogue. </P>
<P>Prostacyclin (epoprostenol) and Iloprost have been shown in some studies that are not randomised controlled studies (RCTs) to be effective in improving cardiopulmonary variables with a reduction in the mean PAP and PVR and an improvement in CI. However, other studies have documented both serious adverse effects and lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1988</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of the review were to determine the benefit of prostacyclin or one of its analogues for the treatment of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and its variant which occurs with collagen vascular diseases, especially systemic sclerosis or CREST syndrome.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-20 11:34:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised double- blind or single- blind, placebo -controlled, either parallel group or cross- over studies, were selected for inclusion in this review. The placebo group included patients receiving conventional treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Open, prospective trials and uncontrolled trials were not analysed but are discussed.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adult subjects with a diagnosis of idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension (with no obvious underlying cause) or pulmonary hypertension as part of a collagen vascular disease were included. The diagnosis of interstitial lung disease was based on clinical symptoms, imaging techniques (high resolution CT scanning), histology of lung specimens and results of bronchoalveolar lavage. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was based on clinical symptoms (mainly breathlessness, but often very non specific) and the results of right heart catheterisation studies.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention in the actively treated group was prostacyclin or one of its analogues, such as Iloprost, epoprostenol, treprostinil or beraprost given intravenously, subcutaneously, nebulised or orally. The control group consisted of patients receiving conventional treatment or placebo. Studies assessing the additive effects of prostacyclin will not be considered by this review. </P>

<P>Continuous data for absolute change in exercise capacity were presented graphically. There was a significant difference between the two groups at 12 weeks of 36.4 metres (P=0.004). These data have been entered as generic inverse variance data with a SEM calculated from the published P value. Dichotomous data from the 6 minute walking test were reported as percentages of the sample. These have been entered but not analysed. Following treatment with iloprost 37.6% participants compared with 25.5% in the placebo group were reported as having achieved a 10% increase in distance walked in 6 minutes from baseline values (P=0.06). 42.6% (iloprost) versus 32.4% (placebo) had &lt;10% increase to &lt;10% decrease in distance walked, and 13.9% (iloprost) versus 25.5% (placebo) had a &gt;/=10% decrease in distance walked.</P>
<P>Data were also stratified by primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension due to other causes. There were non-significant differences between iloprost and placebo-treated participants with primary and secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension. 49.1% (iloprost) versus 30.9% (placebo) participants with PPH achieved a 10% increase in distance walked, 37.7% (iloprost) versus 20.0% (placebo) participants had between &lt;10% increase to &lt;10% decrease in distance walked and 5.7% (iloprost) versus 32.7% had &gt;/=10% decrease in distance walked.

</B>The moderate level of statistical heterogeneity on many of the outcomes relating to adverse effects could be explained by the longer period of titration in <LINK REF="STD-Barst-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barst 2003</LINK>, leading to more frequent adverse reactions. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that differences in study duration did not lead to more heterogeneous findings. We might anticipate that dichotomised data from longer-term studies would provide higher event rates, due to the longer exposure to the study drug, than would data from studies of shorter duration. In this instance, such a variable may not be so important, as from weeks 7-12 in <LINK REF="STD-Gali_x00e8_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Galiè 2002</LINK>, many adverse events abated as drug dosage was maintained (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We have reviewed evidence from nine randomised controlled trials, assessing the effects of prostacyclin administered as intravenous, inhaled, subcutaneous and oral preparations. The initial version of this review concluded that prostacyclin improved important markers of disease such as exercise capacity and functional class status. These conclusions were drawn from non-placebo controlled evidence of intravenous preparations of prostacyclin. It is of note that the positive findings reported for exercise capacity in placebo-controlled studies conducted subsequently to the original review are smaller. This may reflect important differences in the effect estimates derived from placebo and usual care control interventions in the studies. When given in any form, prostacyclin has been shown to improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamics. The impact on functional status is mixed, and may reflect varying potencies of the different drug delivery systems, as well as differences in baseline patient populations. In the absence of a proven effect on mortality, prostacyclin and other drugs assessed in clinical trials such as endothelin antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanthapillai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanthapillai 2004</LINK>) may offer only a stop gap until transplantation can be undertaken in this population. <BR/>

<BR/>
</B>We selected exercise capacity as the primary outcome for the review. When analysed as a continuous outcome (i.e. as average distance walked) only <LINK REF="STD-Olschewski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olschewski 2002</LINK> reported a significant difference in favour of inhaled iloprost. The significant pooled effect estimate previously reported in the review was derived from studies which did not have a placebo control. The effects of oral beraprost did not provide evidence of a consistent effect on exercise capacity. Galiè2002 showed an improvement in exercise capacity at 12 weeks of 25.1 m with a greater improvement in those with primary pulmonary hypertension. When longer term data were recorded in <LINK REF="STD-Barst-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barst 2003</LINK>, the median difference in exercise capacity between beraprost and placebo only reached statistical significance in the first half of the study. </P>
<P>Improvements in functional capacity were observed for non-placebo controlled evidence pertaining to IV prostacyclin and to a large placebo-controlled trial of inhaled prostacyclin. Although intended to reflect a patient's ability to carry out physical activity, it is not widely regarded as an indicator of quality of life. Changes in functional class status could represent meaningful improvements to a patient's daily physical activity, but the absence of quality of life measurements in these studies precludes a more complete insight into the subjective improvements noticed by participants. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>When compared with placebo, side-effects have been demonstrably more frequent with prostacyclin. Serious or life-threatening complications were rare in the RCTs reported. However, other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Humbert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humbert 1998</LINK>) have suggested that there is an increased risk of sepsis and catheter-related thrombosis in patients with pulmonary hypertension in the context of connective tissue diseases. There may be an increased risk of acute pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in scleroderma (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1988</LINK>). Additional information may be required to evaluate the benefit: risk ratio of long-term prostacyclin therapy in pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases. The mechanisms which result in the development of idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma are not clear. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of the scleroderma spectrum of diseases which includes diffuse scleroderma, limited scleroderma (the CREST syndrome) and the overlap syndrome. In the scleroderma spectrum of diseases, the antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels are elevated in 90-100 % of patients but do not correlate with the presence or severity of lung disease. SCl 70 is a predictor of interstitial lung disease and is found in 40% of patients with diffuse scleroderma. The presence of anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) is a predictor of pulmonary vascular disease and occurs in 60% of patients with CREST (<LINK REF="REF-Stupi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stupi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ungerer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ungerer 1983</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Badesch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badesch 2000</LINK> study, patients had either positive test for ACA or SCl 70 antibodies. However, no data were available as to which patients had which antibodies in order to do a sub-group analysis to see if these different groups responded differently to the prostacyclin infusion. The good haemodynamic and symptomatic response to prostacyclin in that study suggests that reversible vasospasm may be important in the development of pulmonary hypertension in patients with scleroderma. </P>
<P>In scleroderma, there is vasospasm of the pulmonary vasculature with structural changes in the walls of blood vessels. These patients have in the past been treated with agents such as captopril, nifedipine and prazosin with only limited success. Prostacyclin may act by vasodilating these vessels as well as by preventing platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="STD-Menon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-la-Mata-1994" TYPE="STUDY">de la Mata 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humbert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humbert 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Patients with scleroderma may also have major morbidity due to Raynaud's phenomenon, with the development of digital ischaemia and ulceration. A Cochrane review of Iloprost and Cisaprost (prostacyclin analogues) in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon in scleroderma has shown that intravenous Iloprost was effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon and in preventing or healing digital ulcers. Oral Iloprost was not as good and cisaprost had minimal or no efficacy when given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thurm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Thurm 1991</LINK> argue that patients with scleroderma have a fixed pulmonary vascular bed due to structural changes and have little reversible pulmonary vasospasm as iloprost infusion had no effect on diffusing capacity in the sitting or the supine position. There may be a reversible element early in the course of the disease, but progressively, with time, there are permanent, irreversible changes. In this study, most of the patients had diffuse scleroderma and so are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of pulmonary fibrosis. </P>
<P>The acute vasodilator response to intravenous epoprostenol did not predict long-term response in these studies. This makes it less likely that long-term vasodilatation is the mechanism responsible for the haemodynamic improvements. There is some evidence that in scleroderma, an acute vasodilator response predicts a worse outcome (personal communication from Dr Carol Black). It is postulated that the beneficial effects of epoprostenol may be due to inhibition of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in the vessels. The longer-term benefits may also be due to antiproliferative effects of prostacyclin, decreasing destructive remodeling processes in the pulmonary arterial tree. There is a lack of knowledge about the mechanism of action of epoprostenol and little published data on its metabolism during long-term infusion. There is no evidence that permanent regression of the pathological process occurs. It is also uncertain whether early, aggressive treatment prevents or retards progression of disease.<B> </B>
</P>
<P>The limitations of the evidence assembled concern control treatments, blinding, the therapeutic dosage of prostacyclin and the patient populations recruited. Early studies using intravenous prostacyclin in general were affected by lack of blinding and lack of placebo control. It was considered unethical to insert intravenous indwelling catheters into patients in the control arm of all of the studies as these devices are associated with some risk. Therefore, patients receiving active treatment were immediately identifiable. However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Badesch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badesch 2000</LINK>, all patients wore an ambulatory infusion pump and a hospital gown over their clothes so that the investigators assessing exercise capacity were blinded as to treatment group. However, this does not remove patient bias. The minor side effects of prostacyclin therapy are common and characteristic (jaw pain, diarrhoea, headache). It was also unacceptable to have seriously ill patients on no therapy. Therefore, the earlier studies were designed to compare conventional therapy plus prostacyclin with conventional therapy alone. The drugs given to patients receiving conventional therapy were not standardised and the doses of these were regulated by the clinicians as they felt appropriate. In at least one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK>), there was a big difference in medical therapy between the patients in the conventional and in the treatment groups. All studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Thurm-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Thurm 1991</LINK> had study protocols which titrated the study drug upwardly from the outset. The aim of this was to balance disease control with side effects. Given the short duration of the majority of studies, it is feasible that drug dose optimisation may not have been fully established in all participants, which may have been due to the side effect profile. The conflicting effects observed in the beraprost trials suggest that the initial benefit of this preparation of prostacyclin attenuates over time. This raises the possibility that in order to maintain short-term benefits, a high dose of the drug needs to be given. Given the significant risk of unpleasant side effects associated with beraprost, such a treatment would require careful consideration. Current guidelines recommend endothelin receptor antagonists, and IV epoprostenol ahead of beraprost for long-term therapy in functional class III (<LINK REF="REF-ACCP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCP 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The more recent studies with other modes of delivery were able to use a placebo control. Therefore, blinding was possible and this reduces bias. However, these studies all included patients with diverse disease aetiologies and as subgroup analysis was not always provided, firm conclusions on the efficacy of the treatment in all forms of pulmonary hypertension is not possible. Certain trialists did make distinctions between the participants recruited to the studies. Subgroup analysis by the trialists in <LINK REF="STD-Simonneau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simonneau 2002</LINK> indicated that greatest improvement was observed in more severely ill participants (NYHA functional Class 3). A dose-response relationship was also noted, with patients whose dose was titrated upwards, achieving a greater improvement in their 6 minute walk. There were no significant differences in response between patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension secondary to other causes. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>When the effects of beraprost are considered, it is noteworthy that the patients in these studies were not as compromised as those in the other studies. The lack of response in these patients could be explained by their [ do you mean variation in severity]. There was no statistically significant improvement in NYHA functional class and cardio-pulmonary haemodynamics in either study. Patients with other forms of primary pulmonary hypertension did not show a statistically significant improvement. This included patients with congenital cardiac shunts, portal hypertension, collagen vascular diseases and HIV infection. It is not clear whether the patients with PPH were more compromised, and therefore showed a greater response. Several non-randomised studies have looked at nebulised prostacyclin in PPH and in pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disorders and have shown an improvement in exercise capacity, cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables and symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Hoeper-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hoeper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stricker-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stricker 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olschewski-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Olschewski 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olschewski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olschewski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olschewski-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Olschewski 2000</LINK>). There is some evidence that nebulised prostacyclin may produce a greater haemodynamic response than inhaled prostacyclin without a significant effect on systemic arterial pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Mikhail-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mikhail 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olschewski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olschewski 1999</LINK>). The drug was well tolerated in this form except for mild coughing, headaches and jaw pain. </P>
<P>One small non-randomised study of only 18 patients has suggested that an ultrasonic device delivering inhaled iloprost may improve drug delivery and reduce delivery time compared to a jet nebulizer (<LINK REF="STD-Gessler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gessler 2001</LINK>). Clearly, a randomised study with adequate numbers of patients will be necessary to clarify this. The safety profile of inhaled iloprost appears to be favourable compared to intravenous administration in the short-term. </P>
<P>Other non-randomised studies have shown that orally active prostacyclin analogues improved haemodynamic variables and NYHA functional class for up to 12 months of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Okano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Okano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saadjian-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saadjian 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vizza-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vizza 2001</LINK>). Flushing and headaches were the main side effects seen. </P>
<P>There is some evidence that a combination of inhaled iloprost with oral sildenafil (a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) may have a synergistic effect, improving mean PAP and PVR (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkens-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkens 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghofrani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ghofrani 2002</LINK>) but larger randomised trials will be necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn. </P>
<P>There were no data available on the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with pulmonary hypertension with prostacyclin for several years. <LINK REF="REF-Higenbottam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higenbottam 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higenbottam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Higenbottam 1998</LINK> have suggested that the relative cost per index of quality of life may be similar for prostacyclin and heart-lung transplantation and that prostacyclin delayed the need for transplantation, though the procedure now performed is single lung transplantation. </P>
<P>Non-randomised long-term studies have consistently shown an improvement in symptoms, exercise capacity, NYHA functional class, cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and survival with intravenous prostacyclin in PPH (<LINK REF="STD-McLaughlin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McLaughlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barst-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Barst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higenbottam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higenbottam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higenbottam-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higenbottam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higenbottam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Higenbottam 1998</LINK>) and in pulmonary hypertension associated with SLE (<LINK REF="STD-Robbins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robbins 2000</LINK>) and connective tissue diseases (<LINK REF="STD-Humbert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humbert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Humbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLaughlin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McLaughlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humbert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humbert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Humbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-la-Mata-1994" TYPE="STUDY">de la Mata 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bartosik-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bartosik 1996</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review has shown that prostacyclin can be effective in improving exercise capacity, cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, NYHA functional class and symptoms in patients with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension and with other forms of secondary pulmonary hypertension including that associated with scleroderma, provided a therapeutically effective dose of the drug can be administered without undue side-effects. Intravenous, subcutaneous, inhaled and oral analogues of prostacyclin were effective compared with control or placebo groups although to different extents.<B> </B>The majority of these studies were performed over a short period of time (eight - 12 weeks) and there are only a very limited amount of data currently available on survival or side effects over a longer period. Prognostic indicators were NYHA functional class, CI, PAP, PVR and mixed venous oxygen saturations (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higenbottam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higenbottam 1995</LINK>) and patient selection may be important when considering long-term treatment with intravenous prostacyclin. Although some of the side effects described are tolerated reasonably well by patients, potentially serious and life-threatening complications can occur, mainly related to the drug delivery system with intravenous administration. Subcutaneous treprostinil may therefore have an important role in treating patients with moderate symptoms who are not severe enough to require intravenous prostacyclin. </P>
<P>There is some evidence that increasing doses of the drug when given intravenously may be required with time to maintain the same effects i.e. tachyphylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK>). However, there is no guidance from the published randomised studies on the increases in the doses that may be required in the long-term and on the tolerability and side effects of such doses. There are few data on the cost effectiveness of this treatment in the long term and this may be an important factor, especially in the UK. </P>
<P>Prostacyclin is only one of several drugs now available for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension; endothelin receptor antagonists and selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have also been shown to be effective and combination of all of these will probably be the way to manage these patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for RCTs that follow patients for a much longer period of time so that the problems that may exist with tachyphylaxis can be assessed. There is also a need for information on side effects in the longer term. Studying groups of patients with scleroderma who have either ACA or SCL 70 antibodies and seeing if they respond differently to prostacyclin may be helpful in determining the mechanisms involved and in determining prognosis. Studies on patients with early and late disease may also be helpful in determining whether early treatment has a disease-modifying role although it may not be possible to do this for ethical reasons and because of the cost implications<B>. </B>Finally, trials combining prostacyclin analogues with other drugs are currently in progress, and these may clarify the role of this drug in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</P>

<P>This was a randomised double-blind controlled study on 23 male patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD). The average age of the patients was 62. All patients had poor lung function (FEV1 &lt;70%) with mean PAP &gt; 20 mmHg. Cicletanine has been shown to enhance the production of endogenous prostacyclin. In the short-term study, patients were allowed to rest for 30 minutes after the insertion of catheters and baseline measurements were made. They were given 50 mg of cicletanine or placebo orally and measurements made hourly for up to 3 hours. In the long-term study, 50 mg of cicletanine or placebo was administered orally on a daily basis with assessments at 3 and 12 months. Outcome measures were cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation (PaO2). Adverse events were not reported. This study was excluded as it focused on secondary pulmonary hypertension and this review was concerned with primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma.</P>
