Whilst there is good evidence for the benefit of OCS in acute asthma, as you point out this has not been shown in young children with viral wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results : Fine. I would suggest that for updates the primary subgroup shown is asthma v viral wheeze with possibly a third category for unclear. My prior is that OCS are useful in acute asthma and not in viral wheeze, but clinically some children are hard to categorise (as you point out)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : Toby please amend graph labels and this can go for peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Signed off by BHR 180406&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Brian,&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your comments.

Why not all children up to 18? This may need reconsideration please. Also the outcomes are currently a problem for children in the community. I would expect a child given oral steroids to require assessment by a primary care doctor or nurse (?good outcome for safety) and this is going to be muddled with attendance at hospital (?bad outcome for ED or inpatient). Why not have primary outcome as admission to hospital? Some of the secondary outcomes do not seem sensible for community care (eg oxygenation and asthma free days could come out). I also wonder whether it would be more helpful to divide the children by age (under and over 2 years for example) rather than by atopic history etc. as this might be more useful to readers? &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Recruitment setting: participants recruited following a hospital admission or emergency department presentation with acute asthma versus participants recruited in the community (including outpatient or general practice clinics).&amp;quot; I think this needs to come out of sensitivity analysis as I do not see how ED and inpatient settings can be appropriate to this review question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods : NNT should be calculated from the pooled OR so that it can be applied to a range of baseline risks as described (the latter is not possible using inverse of pooled RD)! I suggest using I-square as a better measure of heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : Toby to send back to Brian and authors please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Parent initiated oral corticosteroid therapy for intermittent wheezing illnesses in children&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-11-14 14:29:42 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="PAR-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.16" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Oral corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children if they are commenced after the child has been assessed by a doctor. This review identified two randomised trials of parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in the management of an intermittent wheezing illness in children. There was no evidence of more benefit than harm. Widespread use of this strategy cannot be recommended at present. Further randomised clinical trials are required.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-10 13:54:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Intermittent wheezing illnesses, which include viral associated wheeze and asthma, are amongst the most common reasons for children to present urgently to a doctor. Whether parents should commence oral corticosteroids (OCS) for an episode of acute wheeze in their child without waiting for a medical review is an important question, as the potential benefits of early oral corticosteroid intervention have to be weighed against the potential adverse effects of treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives were to assess the benefits and harmful effects of parent-initiated OCS, in the management of intermittent wheezing illnesses in children, based on the results of randomised clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 13:54:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts were combined (all searched November 2008). Manufacturers and researchers in the field were also contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised clinical trials studying patients aged between one and eighteen years old, with an intermittent wheezing illness (asthma, viral wheeze, preschool viral wheeze) were included. Interventions encompassed OCS at any dose or duration versus placebo or other drug combination. The trials could be unpublished or published and no language limitations were applied.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-15 12:02:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. The statistical package (RevMan) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration was used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>From 572 original citations, a total of 2 randomised clinical trials (303 randomised participants) were included. The quality of the included trials was high; however, marked clinical heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. The two trials did not find evidence that parent-initiated OCS are associated with a benefit in terms of hospital admissions, unscheduled medical reviews, symptoms scores, bronchodilator use, parent and patient impressions, physician assessment, or days lost from work or school. Adverse outcomes were inadequately documented.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Limited current evidence is available and it is inconclusive regarding the benefit from parent-initiated OCS in the treatment of intermittent wheezing illnesses in children. Widespread use of this strategy cannot be recommended until the benefits and harms can be clarified further.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-14 14:11:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Intermittent wheezing illnesses in children, which include viral associated wheeze and asthma, are one of the leading causes of emergency department presentations and hospital admission worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2005</LINK>). Oral corticosteroids (OCS) commenced following physician review are effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2001</LINK>). Accordingly, the four major international asthma management guidelines suggest that OCS should be commenced as soon as possible in an episode of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-CAG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2002</LINK>). Each describes a role for parent-initiated OCS in their treatment algorithms and written asthma management plans, but stops short of explicitly recommending in the text of the guideline that parents be instructed to independently commence OCS without a medical review. To date a systematic review of the role of parent-initiated OCS in intermittent wheezing illnesses during childhood has not been published.</P>
<P>Many of the clinical benefits of corticosteroids in the setting of an intermittent wheezing illness have been shown to begin within 1-3 hours of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Rachelefsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachelefsky 2003</LINK>) and it would seem logical that parent-initiated treatment may be an effective strategy. However, it is important to recognise two important limitations of this theory. First, only a minority of episodes of acute wheeze result in an unscheduled medical review (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2004</LINK>). Hence the group of episodes of wheeze for which parents would be initiating treatment with OCS are likely to be less severe. Second, the strategy relies on the ability of the parent to make an accurate assessment of their child's clinical status, and there are a number of studies which have demonstrated that parents have some difficulty in making this assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>). It is also important to recognise that parent-initiated treatment with OCS is likely to result in more frequent administration of OCS to children with intermittent wheeze, and this may have important implications for growth, osteoporosis, and other unwanted side effects.</P>
<P>During the first months of life RSV bronchiolitis is the predominant cause of intermittent wheeze. It is contentious that corticosteroids have any role in the management of RSV bronchiolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>). Therefore parent-initiated OCS cannot be recommended for this group of patients. Beyond 12 months of age two, quite distinct subgroups of intermittent childhood wheeze have been identified. Younger children tend to suffer from discrete episodes of wheeze in association with viral respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="REF-Mertsola-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertsola 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuehni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuehni 2001</LINK>), they generally do not have risk factors for atopic sensitization (<LINK REF="REF-Sherrill-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrill 1999</LINK>) and are often asymptomatic by six years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 1995</LINK>). This disease entity has been described as viral associated wheeze. By comparison older children with intermittent wheeze are characterized by the presence of atopy and increased airway responsiveness to a range of stimuli, in keeping with atopic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Louis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1997</LINK>). There is no tool or marker which can reliably distinguish between viral associated wheeze and asthma. As such this review will assess the role of parent-initiated OCS in intermittent wheezing illnesses in children aged 1 to 18 years of age overall. A subgroup analysis will then be used to assess the role of parent-initiated OCS in children with those factors that are most strongly associated with the diagnosis of asthma, namely a history of eczema, a family history of asthma in a first degree relative and age (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 1995</LINK>). Researchers have employed various other clinical and laboratory markers in an attempt an attempt to distinguish asthma from viral associated wheeze, however none of these markers have been shown to have sufficient sensitivity nor specificity to be clinically useful or to form a justifiable basis for a subgroup analysis. </P>

<P>We included only randomised controlled trials in which parent-initiated (i.e. without preceding physician review) OCS were compared with placebo, or any other drug, or drug combinations, for children aged between 1 and 18 years. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children aged 1 to 18 years, with intermittent wheeze, treated with OCS or the comparison medication(s) independently initiated by the parent or child. Intermittent wheeze was defined as having previously suffered from discrete wheezing episodes. Trial participants may have been recruited from any setting (emergency room, observation unit, in-patient, out-patient, general practice or the community) to take part in a trial of parent-initiated OCS for subsequent episodes of intermittent wheeze. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies were considered for inclusion if participants were randomised to receive parent-initiated OCS compared to a comparison medication, or placebo, prior to being seen by clinical staff (e.g. nurse practitioner, nurse, physician). All doses and dosing regimes for OCS were included. Co-interventions were permitted, therefore we recorded data pertaining to co-interventions received. If these data were not available within the manuscript, we requested them from the study authors.</P>

<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1995</LINK>) comprised a randomised placebo controlled cross-over trial involving 86 children 2 to 14 years of age with a diagnosis of 'asthma' who were identified from clinic records. The intervention consisted of a single 2 mg per kg dose of prednisolone. The patients were observed for a pre-determined 12-month period: 6 months of prednisolone vs. 6 months placebo. The primary outcome measure was the number of unscheduled medical reviews for acute asthma. The analysis was paired i.e. each of the 78 participants who completed the study was compared with his or herself. All participants who completed the study were included in the analysis, regardless whether or not they suffered from zero, a single or multiple episodes of acute wheezing. A secondary analysis was conducted which was restricted to participants who actually suffered one or more episodes of acute asthma treated with the study medication. However, we were unable to determine the method of this analysis or obtain the raw data.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Oommen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Oommen 2003</LINK>), a randomised placebo controlled trial, involved 217 children 1 to 5 years old who had been admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of viral wheeze. The intervention consisted of 20 mg of prednisolone administered once daily for 5 days. The period of observation was not pre-determined and ranged from several months to more than three years. The primary outcomes measures were the mean 7-day day-time and 7-day night-time symptom scores. The analysis comprised a parallel comparison restricted to only those participants who suffered an episode of wheeze resulting in parent-initiated treatment with the study medication and successfully completed the symptom diary.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is a sound theoretical basis for the hypothesis that parent-initiated OCS may be effective in the management of intermittent wheezing illnesses in children. However, this systematic review demonstrates that the limited amount of published data available do not show a benefit in terms of hospital admissions, unscheduled medical reviews, symptom scores, parent perceptions or the use of bronchodilators in children treated with parent-initiated prednisolone compared with placebo. Indeed the data from the first paper (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1995</LINK>) suggests children treated with prednisolone may be more likely to require and unscheduled medical review. Moreover, there is evidence from at least one trial, that such an intervention actually <B>
<I>increases</I>
</B> medical visits, at least in the younger age groups.</P>
<P>The included data were insufficient to perform any of the planned subgroup analyses. The authors of the earliest study (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1995</LINK>) reported a subgroup analysis of children five years of age and younger and those six years of age and older. The younger children were more likely to require an unscheduled medical review during the six-month period that their study medication was prednisolone (in keeping with the study's findings overall). Amongst the older children there was no difference detected between treatment groups. The proportion of children within these two age brackets was not reported, nor obtained following correspondence with the authors. Asthma prevalence falls with age (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 1995</LINK>), and therefore it is likely that this review contains little data relevant to children beyond the primary school years.</P>
<P>There are a number of limitations in the existing literature, in addition to the insufficient volume of data. The disease severity of the trial participants in the included studies is difficult to quantify. It is also difficult to know if parents in the included studies commenced study medication for an appropriate indication. Neither of the included papers described the process by which parents were educated about the protocol for commencing treatment, nor measurement of the ability of the parents to make this assessment accurately.<BR/> <BR/>Adverse effects of OCS were inadequately examined in the included trials. It is intriguing that the data from the earliest study (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1995</LINK>) suggested the parent-initiated OCS may be associated with an increase in unscheduled medical reviews. This may relate to emotional and behavioural changes that have been well documented in children treated with 2 mg/kg of prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Kayani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayani 2002</LINK>). A more complete measurement of adverse effects would facilitate the assessment of benefit and harm.</P>

<LI>Large trials will be required to clarify the role of parent-initiated OCS in intermittent wheezing illnesses in children. The optimal steroid type, dose and duration remain unknown.</LI>
<LI>Sufficient sample sizes will be required to determine the benefits in subgroups who may respond more favourably to steroid therapy. For example, children with risk factors for atopic asthma, children with more severe disease and school-aged children should be clearly identified in future research.</LI>
<LI>It will be important to document the severity of disease amongst study participants and to optimise and measure the ability of parents to commence treatment for an appropriate indication.</LI>
