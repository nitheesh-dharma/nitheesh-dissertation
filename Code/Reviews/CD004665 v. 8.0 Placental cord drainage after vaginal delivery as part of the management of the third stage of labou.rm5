<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The third stage of labour begins immediately after the birth of the baby and ends with the expulsion of the placenta and fetal membranes. It is preceded by contraction and retraction of the uterus to reduce uterine size and expel the placenta with minimal haemorrhage. The third stage of labour can be managed actively or by expectant management,  where the umbilical cord remains attached to the baby until after delivery of the placenta; blood within the placental compartment drains into the baby. Placental cord drainage involves clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord after the birth of a baby and then, immediately unclamping the maternal side of the cord so the blood can drain freely into a container. This may or may not, be used together with other interventions such as routine administration of an oxytocic drug (to contract the womb), controlled cord traction (applying traction to the cord with counter-pressure on the womb to deliver the placenta) or maternal effort.</P>
<P>This review included three studies involving 1257 birthing women. The findings showed that placental cord drainage in the management of third stage of labour reduced the length of third stage of labour by a mean of about three minutes and reduced blood loss by average of 77 ml. There was no clear difference in the manual removal of placenta or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage or incidence of blood transfusion. The trials did not report on maternal pain or discomfort during the third stage of labour. Some of the outcomes were not reported in the same way in all trials, limiting the amount of information available for analysis. Other desired outcomes were either not reported or were not reported in an appropriate way for statistical analysis (e.g. placenta not delivered within 30 minutes after birth, maternal haemoglobin changes). Further investigation of the effect of placental cord drainage on maternal outcomes would be useful although it is not a priority area for maternity research.</P>

<P>Three studies involving 1257 women met our inclusion criteria. Cord drainage reduced the length of the third stage of labour (mean difference (MD) -2.85 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.04 to -1.66; three trials, 1257 women (heterogeneity: T² = 0.87; Chi²P=17.19, I² = 88%)) and reduced the average amount of blood loss (MD -77.00 ml, 95% CI -113.73 to -40.27; one trial, 200 women).</P>
<P>No incidence of retained placenta at 30 minutes after birth was observed in the included studies, therefore, it was not possible to compare this outcome. The differences between the cord drainage and the control group were not statistically significant for postpartum haemorrhage or manual removal of the placenta. None of the included studies reported fetomaternal transfusion outcomes and there were no data relating to maternal pain or discomfort during the third stage of labour.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There was a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and also in the amount of blood loss when cord drainage was applied compared with no cord drainage. The clinical importance of such observed statistically significant reductions, is open to debate. There is no clear difference in the need for manual removal of placenta, blood transfusion or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Due to small trials with medium risk of bias, the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:34:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The third stage of labour begins immediately after the birth of the baby and ends with the expulsion of the placenta and fetal membranes. It is preceded by contraction and retraction of the uterus and reduction of uterine size. Reduction of the internal surface of the uterus and limited placental elasticity, leads to separation from the uterus. A study of ultrasonographic imaging on the third stage of labour showed that the thickening and shortening of the placental site of the uterine wall is the major driving force in the process of placental detachment (<LINK REF="REF-Herman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herman 1993</LINK>). These investigators did not notice any haematoma (blood clot) formation between the placenta and the uterine wall as described in the traditional Duncan-Schultze theory of placental separation. A haematoma is sometimes formed between the separating placenta and the remaining decidua, which is believed to be the result rather than the cause of separation. It may, however, accelerate the process of separation (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2009</LINK>). In the absence of a clear understanding of the physiology of placental separation, in order to optimise outcomes, trials tend to focus on different management techniques.</P>
<P>The third stage of labour is generally managed using two different approaches: 'active management' and 'physiological or expectant management'. The former method involves administration of an oxytocic drug, clamping and cutting the cord as well as controlled cord traction. The type and timing of the oxytocic drugs, route of administration, and timing of the cord clamping may vary considerably between practitioners. The latter form of management mainly involves maternal effort assisted by gravity and/or putting the baby to the breast without using artificial oxytocics or early clamping or controlled cord traction (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 1994</LINK>). In this type of management, if clamping was required due to maternal request or any other reason, it is usually done after cord pulsation is stopped.</P>
<P>In the UK, it is currently common practice to clamp both sides of the cord and cut it immediately after the birth of the baby. However, originally, the two main underpinning reasons for clamping the maternal end of the cord are suggested to be (a) to avoid soiling of the bedclothes with blood, and (b) maternal ligature, as a means of knowing if the cord has been lengthened, signifying placental separation (<LINK REF="STD-Botha-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Botha 1968</LINK>). Some practitioners may consider applying a clamp on the cord as necessary for effective controlled cord traction.</P>
<P>Placental cord drainage has been suggested as a way of minimising the impact of cord clamping on the third stage of labour for mothers. It involves the clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord after delivery of the baby but, afterwards, immediately unclamping the maternal side of the cord and allowing the blood from the placenta to drain freely into a container. It has been suggested that draining blood from the placenta would reduce its bulkiness, allowing the uterus to contract and retract, thus aiding delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1997</LINK>). There are anecdotal beliefs among some practitioners that allowing placental cord drainage enhances delivery of the placenta and reduces third stage complications. Fetomaternal haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soltani-20005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 20005a</LINK>) and discomfort or pain during the third stage can also be affected by the amount of residual blood in the placenta.</P>
<P>In a normal physiological third stage of labour, the umbilical cord is not clamped until after delivery of the placenta, permitting placental transfusion. The placental transfusion has been shown to be complete by two to five minutes after the birth, in most infants (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2011</LINK>). This allows the 'drainage' of blood within the placental compartment into the baby. Clamping the cord at birth followed quickly by unclamping and drainage is close to the physiological process from the mother's viewpoint. Although it can still be considered as an intervention, it is much less so than maintaining the clamp until after delivery of the placenta.</P>
<P>Placental cord drainage may, or may not, be in conjunction with other interventions such as routine administration of oxytocic, controlled cord traction (CCT) or maternal effort. Variation in associated interventions such as timing of cord clamping (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2004</LINK>), application of CCT and timing of administration of uterotonic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2010</LINK>) as well as mode of birth (e.g. instrumental birth) should be borne in mind when evaluating the effects of placental cord drainage on the management of the third stage of labour. Instrumental birth is identified as a risk factor for postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991</LINK>) partly due to the associated complications and longer length of labour and delivery period.</P>
<P>Finally, anecdotal evidence suggests that cord drainage is not usually practised in association with delayed cord clamping. However, it could be argued that delayed cord clamping may reduce the residual blood volume but it seems likely that some blood still remains in the placenta. The extent to which cord drainage affects the management of the third stage of labour needs to be systematically investigated.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-03 20:33:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified a small number of studies with a reasonable level of quality for this review. From these, there appears to be a statistically significant reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and a lower blood loss in the cord drainage group compared with the control group.</P>
<P>The length of the third stage of labour remained shorter in women who had cord drainage compared with the controls in the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) and in the subgroup analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The latter may indicate that this effect is independent of the timing of the administration of the uterotonics and of the mode of delivery.</P>
<P>The reduced length of the third stage of labour and the observed reduction in the amount of blood loss by cord drainage were not translated into a reduction in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage which is the major concern for the care of mothers during the third stage of labour. This may be due to the small size of available data in this review. In the subgroup analyses separating<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2005</LINK> (which included<B> </B>instrumental birth and early administration of uterotonics), an insignificant trend in favour of cord drainage was evident (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>)<B>. </B>Due to the limited number of available studies reporting this outcome, further studies with focused designs may be beneficial.</P>
<P>The other issue was the subjectivity of the outcome measurements. Blood loss was mainly objectively measured in the included studies but not all reported the outcome in a standard way to allow a reliable evaluation of effect size. In none of the studies was it possible to blind the involved health professional, to the subject allocation or outcome measurements. This might have an impact on their estimations of factors such as blood loss and whether a manual removal was necessary.</P>
<P>A major confounding factor in such studies could be the variation in practice of the use of uterotonic drugs both in relation to the type of drug used (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>) and the timing of its administration (<LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2010</LINK>). These issues might have a significant effect on the duration and successful completion of the third stage of labour. Although in this instance, oxytocin was the only uterotonic drug being used in all the included studies and two out of the three included studies, were clear about not using it as part of the management of the third stage of labour before the signs of placental separation (e.g. lengthening of the placental cord, a gush of blood and increased height of the fundus). The results remained significant when <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2005</LINK> (in which uterotonics were used before the placental separation), was excluded from the sensitivity analysis or analysed separately in the subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Instrumental birth can also be a confounding factor in the management of the third stage of labour due to its potential association with complicated birth or birth canal trauma. Although in our review subgroup analysis of women with normal vaginal birth and those with a mixed model of birth (including assisted vaginal birth), did not change the result in that the cord drainage reduced the length of the third stage of labour.</P>
<P>The timing of cord clamping is also an important factor in the management of third stage of labour, which has been reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>. Delayed cord clamping from the mother's viewpoint is similar to cord drainage and our results are similar in the lack of significant differences in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, manual removal of placenta and the need for blood transfusion between the intervention and control groups. However, unlike <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>, we did observe a significantly shorter length of the third stage of labour and a lower amount of blood loss in the intervention group. Whether these differences are due to the clinical heterogeneity of the interventions and complexity of the interacting effects of the associated components in the available studies in which the third stage of labour is examined, remains unclear. This may indicate that comparison of homogeneous packages of care may be a more appropriate way in evaluating effectiveness than focusing on each component of the care during the third stage of labour, in isolation.</P>
<P>Another important issue to address is the impact of the timing of cord clamping and cutting on the well-being of the newborn babies. Only one included study, administered a uterotonic drug (Methergine, given intravenously) at delivery of anterior shoulder, the others administered a uterotonic agent after observing the signs of separation of the placenta. Most studies applied CCT mainly after separation of the placenta. In delayed clamping, especially when oxytocic drugs had been administered, there are some concerns about the risk of over-perfusion of blood to the baby and increased risk of jaundice or hyperbilirubinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 1972</LINK>). Early clamping may deprive babies of a natural source of extra blood volume, from which they could otherwise benefit. The Hinchingbrooke trial (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1998</LINK>) showed a higher mean birthweight of babies in the expectant management group compared with the active management group, which they suggest is probably due to the extra blood received prior to delayed cord clamping.</P>
<P>Finally, it may be argued that the clinical significance of a small statistical reduction in blood loss (about 77 ml) or the reduced length of the third stage of labour (about three minutes) from cord drainage, is open to discussion. Nevertheless, simplicity of this practice and lack of evidence of harm or invasiveness adds to its small benefits observed in this review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We identified three studies with an acceptable quality for this review. There appears to be a consistent result in the use of placental cord drainage in terms of a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour. Although few studies were available, the length of the third stage of labour in the cord drainage group compared with the control group remained consistently lower in the sensitivity analysis where we excluded studies of lower quality or in the subgroup analysis where the only study in which a uterotonic drug was used before the separation of the placenta, was separately analysed.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-03 20:27:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are limitations in the nature of the identified studies. One of the major problems encountered in carrying out this review was the variation in methods of reporting the findings; some studies reported mean and standard deviation, some median and range and others proportions. There was also the issue of poor reporting and lack of clarity on how the study was conducted or the nature of the intervention. This made it harder to compare or combine similar outcome measures. Attempts to contact the authors to obtain raw data or an alternative data format for the outcome measures were not always successful, probably due in most cases to the age of the publications. </P>
<P>No retained placenta was reported in the included studies and the incidence of manual removal of the placenta was not significantly different between the intervention and the control groups. The relative rarity of these events may indicate the need for larger study populations for a meaningful comparison.</P>
<P>Although a limited number of studies were available, we observed some statistically positive effects from cord drainage in reducing the length of the third stage of labour, irrespective of the other interventions (e.g. use of uterotonic drugs). This seems to be a good alternative method where delayed cord clamping in which the blood is naturally drained into the neonatal circulation is of concern.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-03 20:33:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Out of the three included studies, one is of low risk in all the identified sources of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Jongkolsiri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jongkolsiri 2009</LINK>) while the other two studies were of low risk in sequence generation but unclear about allocation concealment and blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shravage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shravage 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Shravage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shravage 2007</LINK> also was unclear about attrition bias. In addition, there is a high level of clinical and statistical heterogeneity in the included studies impacting on the quality of evidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-08-03 20:28:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the nature of the study it was not possible to blind the attendants to the intervention and outcomes. Measurement of postpartum haemorrhage is not very accurate and can be biased by the observers. The decision to proceed to manual removal of the placenta is similarly likely to be very subjective. The accepted global definition of the level of postpartum haemorrhage is also debatable. Compared to estimated blood loss, the length of the third stage is likely to be a less biased outcome. Outcomes such as maternal haemoglobin level may be a more reliable measure although practically restricting, therefore not many studies reported this outcome.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There have been no other reviews of this subject. However, delayed cord clamping has a similar result in reducing the volume of blood retained within the placenta before it is expelled from the uterus. The Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK> showed no significant differences between early and late cord clamping for postpartum haemorrhage or severe postpartum haemorrhage in any of the five trials (2236 women) which measured this outcome (RR for postpartum haemorrhage 500 ml or more 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.55). This indicates that a more physiological approach to the management of the third stage of labour has, at the least, no adverse effect on postpartum haemorrhage.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The results of this study show small positive effects from cord drainage in reducing the length of the third stage of labour by a few minutes and in reducing the amount of blood loss when compared with those without cord drainage. The observed changes may be of little clinical significance particularly in light of the limited availability of high quality studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>This may not be considered a maternity research priority area due to the urgency and importance of other aspects of maternal care with a higher impact on health and well-being of mothers and babies. However, further large-scale well designed randomised studies reporting separately for different clinical groups (e.g. vaginal normal birth and assisted birth) may be helpful in relation to the impact of cord drainage on the management of the third stage of labour. The impact of cord drainage at caesarean section is also of interest. Important outcomes should include maternal haemoglobin and indicators of maternal satisfaction.</P>

<P>The main issue that undermines the reliability of this paper includes a series of reporting bias. The authors initially explain that all participants had early cord clamping, although data in table 1, indicate that almost half of all participants had cord clamping after cord pulsation ceased. The other confusing matter is how they have labelled the intervention group as "late cord clamping" and the control group as "early clamping" (table 1). The timing of cord clamping is a confounding factor. In addition, the cord drainage group has not exclusively had delayed cord clamping, there seems to be some confusion in defining the groups in the study. Also, the outcomes of interest have not reported (PPH) or defined (e.g. manual removal of placenta or retained placenta) in a standard way.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 09:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">Methods used to assess trials included in previous versions of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-27 16:23:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The quality of the studies was assessed by two individual review authors and discussed and agreed within the review team.</P>
<P>We collected the data using a preformatted extraction sheet. The tabulated information included quality of studies and characteristics such as authors, years, methods, participants, interventions and outcome results.<BR/>
<BR/>We attempted to minimise the sources of systematic bias including selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Quality scores for concealment of allocation were assigned using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). As a criterion to assess validity, we allocated a grade to each trial on the basis of allocation concealment: A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, and D = not used. Trials graded as A or B were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>While it is not possible to blind participants or professionals to cord drainage, we assessed studies in terms of whether outcome assessments were blind to researchers who analysed the study. Given that the approach to handling losses of participants (e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations) has the potential to bias results, and that losses are often inadequately reported, we were cautious about implicit accounts of such details.</P>
<P>For all data analyses in this review, we entered data based on the principle of intention to treat. To be included in comparisons, outcome data had to be available for at least 80% of those who were randomised. Statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager software (RevMan 2003).<BR/>
<BR/>The results were presented as relative risks for binary outcomes, or weighted mean difference for continuous outcome measures, with 95% confidence intervals. Where the data were available from two or more studies, we assessed the heterogeneity of the trials using the I²<SUP> </SUP>statistic. If the trials were sufficiently similar, we performed a fixed-effext meta-analysis. If there were differences between the trials (values more than 50% indicate substantial heterogeneity), we investigated the causes of heterogeneity and if they were likely to lead to differences in their treatment effects, we used a random-effects meta-analysis(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Originally we intended to do analyse sensitivity by including:</P>
<OL>
<LI>allocation concealment other than A (adequate) and B (unclear);</LI>
<LI>studies with follow-up rate of less than 80%;</LI>
<LI>quasi-randomised studies.</LI>
</OL>
<P>RESULTS:There were no data for changes in maternal haemoglobin, other than one study giving the proportion of women with a change of 3 g/dl,</P>
