<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Background: Motivational interviewing is widely used to help people to stop smoking. It is a counselling style which helps people to explore and resolve their uncertainties about changing their behaviour. It tries to avoid an aggressive or confrontational approach and instead steer people towards choosing to change their behaviour, and encouraging their self belief. The aim of this review is to discover whether motivational interviewing helps more people to quit than brief advice or usual care, when used to help people to stop smoking.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: We searched for new studies to add to this review in August 2014 and found 14 new studies. Twenty-eight randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials are now included in this review. Studies were included if participants were tobacco users; provided participants were not pregnant women or adolescents; if the intervention being tested was based on motivational interviewing principles; if the study included some kind of monitoring of the motivational interviewing intervention, such as staff training or a measure of the quality of counselling delivered, or both; if the control/comparison condition was brief advice or usual care; and if the study reported smoking abstinence at least six months after the start of the programme. Between them these studies recruited 16,803 tobacco users. Two of the studies recruited smokeless tobacco users, and the rest recruited cigarette smokers. The majority of studies provided motivational interviewing support face-to-face; however seven studies delivered the support by telephone only. </P>
<P>Key findings: Our review found that motivational interviewing appears to help more people to quit smoking than brief advice or usual care when provided by general practitioners and by trained counsellors. Motivational interviewing carried out by general practitioners appeared to be more successful than when carried out by nurses or counsellors. Shorter motivational interviewing sessions (less than 20 minutes per session) were more effective than longer ones. A single session of treatment appeared to be marginally more successful than multiple sessions, but both delivered successful outcomes. The evidence for the value of follow-up telephone support was unclear, and face-to-face counselling did not help more people to quit than telephone counselling. Both approaches were more successful than brief advice or usual care.</P>
<P>Quality of evidence: We have assessed the evidence presented in this review as of moderate quality. Our results should be interpreted with caution, due to variations in study characteristics and how the treatment was delivered. In a number of cases it was difficult to assess the quality of included studies due to a lack of reporting of study details. Finally there is some evidence that studies which did not find an effect of motivational interviewing were less likely to be published and therefore this may impact upon our results. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data in duplicate. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. We counted participants lost to follow-up as continuing smoking or relapsed. We performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 28 studies published between 1997 and 2014, involving over 16,000 participants. MI was conducted in one to six sessions, with the duration of each session ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. Interventions were delivered by primary care physicians, hospital clinicians, nurses or counsellors. Our meta-analysis of MI versus brief advice or usual care yielded a modest but significant increase in quitting (risk ratio (RR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16 to 1.36; 28 studies; N = 16,803). Subgroup analyses found that MI delivered by primary care physicians resulted in an RR of 3.49 (95% CI 1.53 to 7.94; 2 trials; N = 736). When delivered by counsellors the RR was smaller (1.25; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63; 22 trials; N = 13,593) but MI still resulted in higher quit rates than brief advice or usual care. When we compared MI interventions conducted through shorter sessions (less than 20 minutes per session) to controls, this resulted in an RR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.34 to 2.12; 9 trials; N = 3651). Single-session treatments might increase the likelihood of quitting over multiple sessions, but both regimens produced positive outcomes. Evidence is unclear at present on the optimal number of follow-up calls.</P>
<P>There was variation across the trials in treatment fidelity. All trials used some variant of motivational interviewing. Critical details in how it was modified for the particular study population, the training of therapists and the content of the counselling were sometimes lacking from trial reports.  </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cigarette smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable disease worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2000</LINK>). Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to assist smoking cessation are available, and there is good quality evidence for the effectiveness of several of them. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013</LINK> has shown that brief advice from physicians can significantly increase the odds of quitting, as can nicotine replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>), bupropion (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2014</LINK>) and varenicline (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2012</LINK>). There is also evidence that combining pharmacological and behavioural interventions helps people to stop smoking. Both pharmacological and behavioural methods are considered as equal contributors to overall success rates (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The concept of motivational interviewing (MI) evolved from experiences in treating alcohol abuse, and was first described by Miller in 1983. It is defined as "a directive, client-centred counselling style for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence" (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1983</LINK>). The four guiding principles: (a) expressing empathy, (b) developing discrepancy, (c) rolling with resistance, (d) supporting self efficacy, have been detailed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The motivational interviewing process is a brief psychotherapeutic intervention intended to increase the likelihood that a person will make an attempt to change their harmful behaviour. Adaptations of MI have ranged from brief 20-minute office interventions (Motivational Consulting) to Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET), a multi-session course of treatment, including a lengthy assessment, personalized feedback and follow-up interviews (<LINK REF="REF-Rollnick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollnick 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lawendowski-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawendowski 1998</LINK>). MI has also been provided by telephone consultations and in a group format. MI and its various forms have been applied both as a stand-alone intervention or with other treatments, and in a range of settings. These include health settings such as general hospital wards, emergency departments, and general medical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 16:17:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In motivational interviewing, Miller conceptualises that motivation may fluctuate over time or from one situation to another, and can be influenced to change in a particular direction (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1994</LINK>). Thus, lack of motivation (or resistance to change) is seen as something that is open to change. The main focus of MI is facilitating behaviour change by helping people to explore and resolve their ambivalence about behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Rollnick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollnick 1995</LINK>). Miller and Rollnick also suggested that adopting an aggressive or confrontational style or both (as in traditional approaches) is likely to produce negative responses from people (such as arguing), which then may be interpreted by the practitioner as denial or resistance. MI also differs from patient-centred approaches in that it is directive, that is, with MI there is a clear goal of exploring the person's ambivalence in such a way that they are more likely to choose to change the behaviour in question in the desired direction. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MI has been used primarily for the behavioural management of disorders. It has been used to treat alcohol abuse, drug addiction, weight loss, compliance with treatment for asthma and diabetes as well as for smoking cessation. Systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knight-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubak 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Martins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teeter-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teeter 2014</LINK>) have shown MI to be an effective intervention for drug and alcohol use, weight control, diet and exercise, diabetes management, medication adherence and oral health. Two systematic reviews of motivational interviewing to aid smoking cessation have been carried out since this review was first published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Heckman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK>). Both reviews found very modest positive effects of MI at long-term follow. <LINK REF="REF-Heckman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckman 2010</LINK> includes 31 trials and reports an odds ratio (OR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.88) at 22 to 26 week follow-up, and 1.25 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.71) at 52 week follow-up. The main meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK> includes 23 studies and results in an OR of 1.35 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.78). </P>
<P>Both previous reviews had slightly broader inclusion criteria than those used in this review, and <LINK REF="REF-Heckman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckman 2010</LINK> included studies which had active control studies, which may have underestimated the effect of MI. <LINK REF="REF-Allsop-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allsop 2007</LINK> has summarised the difficulties of assessing a given intervention's fidelity to the principles of MI: firstly, its limited theoretical basis compromises our understanding of its essential ingredients and processes; secondly, there are relatively few reliable and practical instruments with which to assess the training, quality and fidelity of implementation of MI's principles; and thirdly, research reports often give inadequate detail of the methods used in what purports to be an MI intervention. Our review attempts to address these pitfalls through the selection, assessment and analysis of the included trials.</P>

<P>Our hypotheses are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>More participants quit smoking when provided with MI treatment than with no advice or simple advice (usual care).</LI>
<LI>MI effects are relatively long-lasting compared with other therapies.</LI>
<LI>Intensive MI ( more sessions, longer duration of each session) is more likely to help people to quit smoking than single or shorter sessions.</LI>
<LI>MI counsellors' attributes, e.g. occupation (doctor, nurse, counsellors), experience or level of training in MI, are potential moderators of the effect size.</LI>
<LI>MI quitters have a similar relapse rate to those who quit with other therapies.</LI>
<LI>MI has incremental effects when combined with other therapies.</LI>
<LI>MI does not have any significant harmful effect.</LI>

<P>The intervention must be based primarily upon the motivational interviewing (MI) principles laid down by Miller and Rollnick (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>). The trial must, in the opinion of the authors, comply with MI principles and practice, beyond simply referring to the concept.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study should make explicit reference to at least some of these MI principles; exploring ambivalence, decision balance, assessment of motivation and confidence to quit, eliciting 'change talk' and supporting self efficacy.</LI>
<LI>To ensure fidelity of intervention, some form of monitoring of MI should also be reported. This could include the details concerning the training of the counsellor and measures to ensure the quality of MI sessions, e.g. by videotaping the sessions or by using an assessment scale and supervision.</LI>
<LI>The intervention could be delivered on an individual basis or as group sessions.</LI>
<LI>Even the briefest of interventions may be acceptable, provided that it met our other inclusion criteria. It is unclear how brief an adaptation of MI may be while still conforming to MI principles and techniques.</LI>
<LI>Face-to-face and telephone-based interviews are both eligible.</LI>
<LI>The therapists could be any healthcare professional or counsellor.</LI>
<LI>Trials with a pharmacological co-intervention (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy) are eligible, provided that the pharmacotherapy was given to all participants and was not the intervention being tested.</LI>
<LI>The comparison (control) intervention could be brief advice (i.e. verbal instruction with a 'stop smoking' message, with or without information on the harmful effects of smoking), a low-intensity intervention, or routine care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Motivational interviewing is frequently linked with the transtheoretical ('stages of change') model of behaviour change. However, it is conceptually and practically distinct from it, and we have not included trials primarily testing that approach. Stage-based interventions are covered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2010</LINK>).</P>

We have preferred sustained abstinence over point prevalence, where both were available. We report abstinence at the longest follow-up, and have required a minimum follow-up of six months from the start of treatment. Where biochemical validation was used, we regard only those participants meeting the biochemical criteria for cessation as abstainers. We assumed participants lost to follow-up to have continued smoking or relapsed, and we include all participants randomized in the denominator (an intention-to-treat analysis).</P>

Smoking cessation outcome data are reported as the number of quitters in each group divided by the number of participants receiving the treatment, i.e. the risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that more people quit in the treatment group than in the control group.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The most commonly-used approach to motivational interviewing (MI) has been one in which the smoker is given feedback intended to develop discrepancy between smoking and personal goals in a non-threatening manner (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hokanson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hokanson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soria-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Soria 2006</LINK>). However, most studies merely specified that the intervention was carried out according to established MI techniques, as developed by <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>. MI was delivered in face-to-face sessions in all the studies except for <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellerbeck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellerbeck 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bastian-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bastian 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lindqvist-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lindqvist 2013</LINK>, in which the counselling was telephone-based.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All but one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>) reported point prevalence abstinence as a main outcome. The outcome data used for <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2011</LINK> in the meta-analysis is point prevalence abstinence reported at both one month and six months (i.e. a cross between point prevalence and prolonged abstinence). We used this outcome, as for all other reported abstinence outcomes the manner of reporting made it impossible to tell to which time point the data referred (i.e. abstinence at one or six months). Five trials reported sustained abstinence at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Dornelas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dornelas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>), and five trials at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Dornelas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dornelas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindqvist-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lindqvist 2013</LINK>).

<P>Two of the included studies offered an assessment of cost effectiveness. <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK> reported on an MI counselling quitline service based in Oregon, with and without nicotine replacement therapy. The cost of intensive telephone counselling per participant was USD 132 (2004 USD), with an incremental cost per quitter of USD 2640 (2004 USD), compared with brief advice. <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1999</LINK>, comparing brief advice with an MI consultation delivered by UK general practitioners, calculated that the cost of training each physician in MI techniques was GBP 69.50, and the additional consultation time for each patient was GBP 13.59. However, the sustained quit rates achieved in this programme did not reach statistically significant levels.</P>

<P>The overall effect across all 28 included trials (N = 16,803), using the strictest definition of abstinence and longest follow-up, gives a modestly significant effect (risk ratio (RR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16 to 1.36; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of follow-up sessions</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analysis of studies by the number of follow-up calls suggested an inverse relationship between the success of MI and amount of telephone follow-up. The lowest risk ratio, and therefore the lowest MI quit rates, was associated with the higher number of follow-up calls, indicating no incremental benefit of multiple calls. Studies with no follow-up calls yielded a RR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.65; 10 trials, N = 3927; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.1); however, this analysis demonstrated substantial heterogeneity, with an I² of 69% (P = 0.11), so should be viewed with caution.

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK> tested for differences between offering follow-up calls and no follow-up support within a single trial. For our meta-analyses we have combined the moderate and intensive intervention arms in that trial, to compare them with a brief advice intervention. We have also separately compared the moderate intervention (no follow-up support) with the intensive intervention (up to four follow-up calls), to quantify the value of the additional support calls. The RR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23; N = 2874, analysis not shown), suggesting no added benefit for additional telephone support in this trial.</P>

When compared to self-help materials or no smoking cessation intervention the effect of MI was non-significant. The pooled self-help control studies had a RR of 1.11 (0.91 to 1.35; 6 trials, N = 3502; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>.1), and the pooled no-smoking cessation control RR was 0.85 (0.61 to 1.19; 2 trials, N = 755<I>; </I>I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>.4).

<P>This review includes studies of participants using smokeless tobacco or smoking cigarettes. Two of the 28 studies recruited only smokeless tobacco users. In this limited number of studies, MI produced a larger relative risk (RR 2.39; 95% CI 1.53 to 3.73; N = 845; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>.1) than the pooled studies of cigarette smoking participants (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.33; N = 15,958; I² = 44%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>.2).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incremental effects</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK> tested for an incremental effect of adding a self-help manual and a supportive video to the initial counselling call. At six month follow-up, 5/29 (17%) in the usual care (control) group had quit, compared with 3/11 (27%) for the MI counselling-only group and 6/20 (30%) for the counselling plus additional materials group. Differences were not statistically significant. We have used the combined intervention group for the analyses throughout this review. <LINK REF="STD-Ellerbeck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellerbeck 2009</LINK> compared MI with two counselling calls every six months to MI with up to six counselling calls every six months. The odds ratio for this comparison at 24 month follow-up was 1.33 (95% CI 0.88 to 2.02), indicating no effect of more intensive counselling. <LINK REF="STD-Rohsenow-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rohsenow 2014</LINK> also compared more- with less-intensive MI by comparing groups with and without two counselling booster sessions. They reported that "logistic regressions were nonsignificant for treatment or booster effects". For both of these studies the higher and lower intensity groups were combined into one MI intervention group for our analyses. Finally <LINK REF="STD-Tevyaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tevyaw 2009</LINK> tested for an incremental effect of adding contingency reinforcement to MI, in the form of cash payments for reductions in smoking behaviour (participants earned on average USD 297.50). Although there was an incremental effect of this reinforcement during the intervention, no effect was found at follow-ups. Again we combined the two MI groups for the purpose of our analyses.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall effect of MI compared with brief advice or usual care appears to be modest . This update, carried out in 2014/2015 resulted in the addition of 14 studies and altered the result very little, although confidence intervals narrowed slightly. This provides further confidence in the validity and precision of the main result. Certain components of interventions appear to enhance the efficacy of MI. There is some limited evidence in this review that MI interventions delivered by general practitioners confer greater benefit than those delivered by nurses or counsellors. Primary care doctors, counselling people with whom they are already familiar and have an established rapport, may be better suited to this approach. However, this finding is based on two relatively small studies, and should not be overstated. When delivered by nurses, the effect of MI was non-significant, which may lend support to the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Rice-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 2013</LINK>, who found that evidence for an effect of smoking cessation interventions delivered by nurses is weaker when their main role is not health promotion or smoking cessation. The question of the amount and intensity of therapist contact also presented an interesting result. The effect size associated with MI sessions of shorter duration (less than 20 minutes) appears to be higher than that associated with longer sessions, and delivering no follow-up calls appear to be associated with a greater effect size than providing them. This is further supported by studies that compared more intensive with less intensive MI as part of their study design (<LINK REF="STD-Ellerbeck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellerbeck 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohsenow-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rohsenow 2014</LINK>), and found that less intensive support was associated with higher abstinence rates. One explanation for this could be that a single, short session of MI is enough to increase a person's motivation to quit smoking, and that by prolonging this and the time to the quit date participants may lose focus on their goal rather than further increasing their motivation.</P>
<P>Face-to-face counselling (with or without telephone follow-up calls) was not associated with a greater effect than counselling delivered entirely by telephone, and either mode of delivery resulted in a superior effect to brief advice or usual care.</P>
<P>Training methods and duration of delivery of the MI counselling ranged from none to 40 hours, and monitoring of delivery and treatment fidelity was highly variable. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2006</LINK>) reported using a validated training tool (the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code). The included trials demonstrated a wide range of components and techniques for the delivery of MI, making direct comparisons across the trials problematic. This may explain the moderate amount of heterogeneity that was observed across the trials in the primary analysis, which could not be fully explained by the subgroup and sensitivity analyses conducted. It is unclear from these trials whether specific MI components or just the 'spirit' of MI is important, and whether short-term achievements translate conclusively into long-term abstinence. The question also remains whether the success rates in the intervention groups were attributable to MI techniques, or simply to a higher intensity intervention than that received by the control group. However, this does not appear to be the case, as when the studies were split according to the control intervention MI was not significantly superior to no or very minimal smoking cessation interventions, but was significantly more successful in comparison to more intensive, in-person interventions. It is unclear why this may be the case.</P>
<P>The studies generally did not define what would have counted as a quit attempt, and did not report the proportion of participants who tried to quit, with or without success. The rate of quit attempts can be interpreted as a mediator of treatment effect, and the lack of such data limits the findings of this review.</P>
<P>Despite the positive findings of our meta-analyses, absolute quit rates were relatively low. Most of the trials included participants unmotivated to quit smoking, although studies produced modest quit rates across the board, with some exceptions (<LINK REF="STD-Dornelas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dornelas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Azevedo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">De Azevedo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindqvist-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lindqvist 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Louwagie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Louwagie 2014</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although the evidence in this review suggests that MI techniques can deliver higher rates of smoking cessation than control, the effect size is somewhat lower than that demonstrated for individual counselling (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.57, across 22 trials when compared to minimal control; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>), and significantly lower than for group behaviour therapy (RR 1.98; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.46, across 13 trials when compared to self-help therapy; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>). Whether this discrepancy may be attributable to an unidentified cause of the observed heterogeneity between studies or to lower efficacy of MI techniques for smoking cessation, remains an open question. Based on a subgroup analysis, splitting participants according to their motivation to quit, it does not seem likely that low motivation to quit explains the moderate effect, as the risk ratio for motivated participants was very similar to the risk ratio for participants who were not recruited on the basis of their wanting to quit tobacco, with mixed motivation to quit. Another subgroup analysis did find that the effect of MI was significantly greater when used to help people to stop using smokeless tobacco in comparison to smoking tobacco. However, as the existing evidence is limited (only two studies of smokeless tobacco cessation which both took place in a military setting) this result should be treated with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-10 18:13:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies in this review generally reported adequately on their design, methods and conduct. Only four trials reported inadequate methods of sequence generation or allocation concealment or both, which are held to be key determinants of selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002b</LINK>). Fourteen of the 28 trials did not confirm blinding of outcome assessment. However, sensitivity analyses testing exclusion for these factors did not alter the review's findings in either case.</P>
<P>Confining the analyses to biochemically validated outcomes and to prolonged abstinence measures in sensitivity analyses reduced the effect size and increased it respectively. In the former case this could be because MI participants had developed a better rapport with their counsellor and so felt more pressure to report that they had remained abstinent, which then went on to be disproved by validation. In the latter case an explanation for a greater effect of MI in the studies measuring prolonged abstinence could be that participants may have gone on to make further quit attempts after relapsing in the control groups, so that point prevalence rates were higher than prolonged rates. Whereas participants using MI were more likely to be quit in the long-term as a result of the original intervention.</P>
<P>Our funnel plot of the included studies (Figure 2) suggests a measure of publication bias or selective reporting or both, in favour of positive findings, which may compromise the strength of the evidence and the review's conclusions.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> indicates that the quality of the evidence generated by this review has been assessed to be of moderate quality.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two previous reviews of MI for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Heckman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK>) provide evidence of a very modest effect of MI at long-term follow-up (6 months or more). Our own effect estimates were also modest but slightly higher than these, providing evidence of a larger benefit of using MI for smoking cessation than the previous reviews. This may be because our inclusion criteria resulted in our including studies more likely to reflect true MI (it was necessary for studies to include some form of MI monitoring, such as training for providers or a measure of treatment fidelity, or both), and which had a minimal intervention or usual care as a control rather than another active intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK> also found evidence of a dose-response relationship, with some evidence to suggest that shorter administrations of MI were more likely to result in quitting than longer administrations, and both <LINK REF="REF-Heckman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckman 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK> also report evidence of a small amount of publication bias. Unlike this review, <LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2010</LINK> found that the baseline motivation of participants moderated the effect of MI. The studies included in their meta-analyis which recruited participants with low motivation produced quit rates two to three times higher than those which recruited highly-motivated participants.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Publication bias or selective reporting or both may have compromised the quality of the evidence in this review. Dissemination of small-scale or 'negative' findings would strengthen the evidence base.</LI>
<LI>Greater clarity and consistency of methods, components and counselling techniques would improve comparability between trials.</LI>
<LI>Future research should attempt to identify which core components of the motivational interviewing approach successfully help people to quit smoking, and whether modifying them enhances or reduces the likelihood of quitting.</LI>
<LI>Future research should compare interventions of equal intensity but different techniques, to test the specific effects of the MI approach.</LI>
<LI>There were frequent discrepancies between self-reported and biochemically-validated measures of abstinence, and several trials did not use any form of biochemical confirmation of abstinence. Biochemical validation tools should be used where possible in future research.</LI>

We have broadened the participant definition to 'tobacco user', and have included one trial of smokeless tobacco use cessation. Sensitivity analyses excluding this trial demonstrated no difference in the review's findings.<BR/>4. The cost-effectiveness hypothesis is now removed.<BR/>5. We have added sub-group analyses, splitting studies by 1) type of control intervention; 2) participant motivation to quit; 3) type of tobacco user, i.e. smoker or smokeless tobacco user.<BR/>

<SUP>1</SUP>Most studies at unclear risk of bias due to a lack of reporting. Very few at high risk of bias. No evidence of sensitivity of the effect due to high risk of bias, so decision made not to downgrade on risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<SUP>2</SUP>Significant amount of heterogeneity (I² = 49%), which is not fully explained by any test for subgroup differences; however confidence intervals largely overlap, so decision made not to downgrade on basis of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded one level due to indication of possible publication bias: funnel plot indicates that less precise studies were more likely to show positive effects.</P>
