<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2006</LINK>) that included 12 RCTs. The previous authors Harvey S, Young D, Brampton W, Cooper A, Doig GS, Sibbald W and Rowan K decided not to update the review.</P>
<P>In this updated version, we found five new large trials and chose to include one large trial which met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>). Additionally three RCTs were excluded due to a different patient population and end points (<LINK REF="STD-Bonazzi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bonazzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESCAPE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESCAPE 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general our review reaches the same conclusions as <LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2006</LINK>. However, we included one large new trial (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>) and thus have more precise estimates on hospital mortality. We applied several additional sensitivity and subgroup analyses which supported the overall results. We graded the quality of evidence of our outcomes. In our discussion we have cited several additional studies which are both in agreement and disagreement with our results. We have reported the review with several additional subheadings and background information. We modified some of the conclusions.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-16 04:11:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sara Margaryan">
<P>A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is a device utilized in intensive care units (ICU) to measure the pressures in the heart and lung blood vessels and to monitor patients. The catheter is inserted into the right side of the heart through a line placed in a large blood vessel in the neck or groin and is positioned into the pulmonary artery. Complications are uncommon and are mainly related to line insertion. Occasionally bleeding inside the lung and changes in heart rhythm have been reported, but death associated with a PAC is rare. The objective of this systematic review was to provide an up-to-date assessment of evidence on the effectiveness of PAC on death rates, days spent in ICU, days spent in hospital, and cost of care for adult ICU patients.</P>
<P>We identified 13 studies comparing patients treated with and without the use of a PAC that studied a total of 5686 patients. These were studies of patients undergoing routine major surgery (eight) and studies of patients who were critically ill and admitted to ICUs (five). We analysed the studies for any trial related risks and performed appropriate statistical analysis to minimize any risk of bias or errors. The quality of evidence is high from this review and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect except for cost analysis.</P>
<P>Our review found that there were no differences in the number of deaths during hospital stay, days spent in general ICUs, and days spent in hospital between patients who did and did not have a PAC inserted. Two US studies were analysed for hospital cost associated with or without a PAC and showed no difference in the cost. Neither group of patients studied showed any evidence of benefit or harm from using a PAC. The catheter is a monitoring tool that helps in diagnosis and is not a treatment modality. Insertion of PACs to help make treatment decisions in ICU patients should be individualized and should be done by experts in the field after adequate training in the interpretation of data. Studies need to be conducted to identify subgroups of ICU patients who can benefit, when the device is used in combination with standardized treatment plans, in reversing shock states and improving organ function.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-16 03:27:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since pulmonary artery balloon flotation catheterization was first introduced in 1970, by HJ Swan and W Ganz, it has been widely disseminated as a diagnostic tool without rigorous evaluation of its clinical utility and effectiveness in critically ill patients. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is inserted through a central venous access into the right side of the heart and floated into the pulmonary artery. PAC is used to measure stroke volume, cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and intracardiac pressures with a variety of additional calculated variables to guide diagnosis and treatment. Complications of the procedure are mainly related to line insertion. Relatively uncommon complications include cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary haemorrhage and infarct, and associated mortality from balloon tip rupture.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-12-16 03:32:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen  Hovhannisyan">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 12); MEDLINE (1954 to January 2012); EMBASE (1980 to January 2012); CINAHL (1982 to January 2012), and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field. We did a grey literature search for articles published until January 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-05-23 13:55:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomized controlled trials conducted in adults ICUs, comparing management with and without a PAC.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-16 03:34:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We screened the titles and abstracts and then the full text reports identified from our electronic search. Two authors (SR and MG) independently reviewed the titles, abstracts and then the full text reports for inclusion. We determined the final list of included studies by discussion among the group members (SR, ND, MG, AK and SC) with consensus agreement. We included all the studies that were in the original review. We assessed seven domains of potential risk of bias for the included studies. We examined the clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity and used random-effects model for meta-analysis. We calculated risk ratio for mortality across studies and mean days for LOS.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-17 03:33:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 studies (5686 patients). We judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be at high risk in about 50% of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30% of the studies. Regardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis. We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29). Of the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately. PAC did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies). Four studies, conducted in the United States (US), reported costs based on hospital charges billed, which on average were higher in the PAC groups. Two of these studies qualified for analysis and did not show a statistically significant hospital cost difference (mean difference USD 900, 95% CI -2620 to 4420, P = 0.62).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-16 03:45:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PAC is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool but not a therapeutic intervention. Our review concluded that use of a PAC did not alter the mortality, general ICU or hospital LOS, or cost for adult patients in intensive care. The quality of evidence was high for mortality and LOS but low for cost analysis. Efficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC-guided management protocols, which when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs could result in benefits such as shock reversal, improved organ function and less vasopressor use. Newer, less-invasive haemodynamic monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC prior to clinical use in critically ill patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-17 15:07:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sara Margaryan">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-16 04:20:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The concept of right heart catheterization was first introduced by Dr Warner Forrsmann in 1929 (<LINK REF="REF-Chatterjee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatterjee 2009</LINK>). It was in 1970 that Dr HJ Swan and Dr William Ganz introduced the flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter that led to a paradigm shift in the way right heart catheterizations are performed at the bedside using intracardiac pressure tracings, without utilizing fluoroscopic guidance. Since then, the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), also called a Swan-Ganz catheter, has been utilized in the management of intensive care unit (ICU) patients for the past 42 years (<LINK REF="REF-Swan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swan 1970</LINK>). A PAC provides the intensivist with critical haemodynamic data that includes cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, intrapulmonary and intracardiac pressures. These variables together with additional derived variables calculated from these measurements, such as pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, right and left ventricular stroke work indices, right and left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic indices, right ventricular ejection fraction, arterial and venous oxygen content, oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery and oxygen extraction ratio, are used to guide treatment of critically ill patients. On average, in the United States (US) one million PACs were used annually in the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-17 15:07:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A PAC is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool. The PAC is used by clinicians in adult medical ICUs, cardiac catheterization laboratories and coronary care units (CCUs). It is used for pre-operative optimization of haemodynamics, intra-operative monitoring and postoperative management of critically ill patients, and in cardiothoracic surgery patients such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG, or bypass surgery) and valvular surgeries to guide therapy and differentiate various types of shock states.</P>
<P>For the procedure, the balloon-tip catheter is floated through a central venous access, through the right atrium and right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and left in position to measure the filling pressures of the heart. When the balloon is inflated it measures pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or occlusion pressure, which is an indirect measure of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Newer PACs have the capability of measuring central venous oxygen saturation and continuous cardiac output.</P>
<P>Insertion of a PAC requires a central venous access and its complications are mainly related to the line placement. Advanced training and ultrasound guidance of line insertions have reduced some of these risks in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Lamperti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamperti 2012</LINK>). Long-term central line related complications such as infections are not attributable to PAC insertion. Additional risks of floating a PAC include possible pulmonary artery rupture and subsequent bleeding or pulmonary infarction (lung tissue loss). In an attempt to review the risk and benefits of a PAC the American Society of Anesthesiologist reviewed 860 publications. Though major morbidity related to PAC seems uncommon, minor atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (heart rhythm abnormalities) are common during catheter insertion (&gt;20%).</P>
<P>Complications from PAC can be classified as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>those from central venous access (arterial puncture, post-operative neuropathy (pain and sensation deficit), air embolism (air in blood vessels) and pneumothorax (air outside the lungs), reported in less than 3.6%;</LI>
<LI>those arising from catheterization (severe dysrhythmias, right bundle branch block and complete heart block), seen in 0.3% to 3.8%; and</LI>
<LI>those due to prolonged catheter residence (pulmonary artery rupture, pulmonary infarction, venous thrombosis (clots in vein)), in from 0.03% to 3%.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The task force states that overall deaths attributed to a PAC are 0.02% to 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-task-force-on-PAC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA task force on PAC 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-16 04:47:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) were initially widely used by cardiologists in the management of patients with acute heart failure or cardiac tamponade, major surgery patients with a cardiac history, and cardiogenic shock. The first data on PACs were published in 1987, in an observational study from 16 different hospitals that looked at time trends in incidence rates, on in-hospital and long-term case fatality rates in patients with acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 1987</LINK>). The study had 3000 patients and showed a sharp rise in the use of PACs from 1975 to 1984 (7.2% to 19.9%) with no difference in mortality in the group of patients with cardiogenic shock. There was, however, increased mortality and hospital length-of-stay (LOS) in patients with congestive heart failure and hypotension who received a PAC. Interestingly, the study showed better long-term survival in patients with cardiogenic shock who received a PAC at six months and five years. In 1990, another non-experimental study showed increased mortality in patients who received a PAC (<LINK REF="REF-Zion-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zion 1990</LINK>). In this study only 67 patients had a PAC and the authors concluded that it was unlikely that the PAC itself had led to the increased mortality. This led to the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PACs in 1991 (<LINK REF="STD-Guyatt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Guyatt 1991</LINK>). The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine later came out with a consensus document recommending the indications for use of PACs (<LINK REF="REF-ESICM-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESICM 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1996, results of a prospective, non-experimental cohort study that involved 5700 patients with nine different illnesses, of which 2100 received PACs, showed increased mortality with PAC use (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>). The publication sparked a lot of controversy primarily because it was a non-randomized comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Assoc.-Press-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assoc. Press 1996</LINK>). A Consensus Statement issued by the Society of Critical Care Medicine identified that the published evidence to support the use of PAC was paltry and scientifically very poor, and the need for clinical trials was highlighted (<LINK REF="REF-PAC-Consensus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAC Consensus 1997</LINK>). Recent evidence suggests that use of a PAC and therapy based on the information obtained reduces surgical morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurgel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurgel 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2011</LINK>). Until now, controversy exists with the use of PACs in various clinical settings in ICUs. If clinicians acquire adequate knowledge and expertise, PAC data and monitoring may be valuable to guide therapy in critically ill patients. The device has to produce data that are reliably interpreted by attending staff. These data are usually not available from other sources and can lead to a change in therapy that is linked to improved outcomes. The therapies that might be altered or added include pressors, inotropes, vasodilators, fluids, diuretics and lusitropic agents.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-16 04:59:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2006</LINK>) about PAC use in adult ICU. The initial review identified 12 studies and the main findings were that PAC did not affect the mortality of patients, hospital or ICU LOS, and the cost based on charges billed to the patients were on average higher in the PAC groups.</P>
<P>Since the adoption of the PAC into clinical practice, several observational studies and five RCTs involving general ICU patients (<LINK REF="REF-Binanay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binanay 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2003</LINK>) have been conducted to determine its effect on patient mortality. These studies did not show a benefit of the use of a PAC in patient outcomes. There was significant negative publicity, especially in the US, leading to a decline in the use of PACs in clinical practice. A report looking at trends in the use of PACs in the US, published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Wiener-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiener 2007</LINK>), reported a 65% reduction in its use among medical ICUs and 63% reduction in its use among surgical ICUs from 1993 to 2004. Recently, however, there has been criticism in the way the data from these studies were interpreted (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2009</LINK>). Authors have argued that the PAC is a monitoring device and that mortality must not be a basis for determining the efficacy of monitors. Patient outcomes are not dependent upon insertion of a PAC; outcomes are dependent upon appropriate interpretation of acquired data followed by administration of appropriate care. It has also been argued that studies were not adequately powered to provide conclusions on rare outcomes like patient mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2009</LINK>). Also, it would have been challenging to adequately blind physicians to the PAC, as it is hard to conceal the presence of a PAC in a patient.</P>
<P>The timeliness of institution of care with regard to PAC insertion has also been questioned. In a meta-analysis performed in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1996</LINK>) that showed no benefit of goal-directed therapy using a PAC in a general ICU population, only one study was considered of high quality (<LINK REF="REF-Gattinoni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattinoni 1995</LINK>). The study randomized 762 patients in one of three categories, cardiac index (CI) 2.5 to 3.5 ml/min/m<SUP>2</SUP>; CI &gt; 4.5 ml/min/m<SUP>2</SUP>; and central venous oxygen saturation &gt; 70%. The patients in the study, however, did not receive the PAC until up to 72 hours after development of shock. The patients in the most recent Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>) that studied the safety and efficacy of PAC-guided versus central venous pressure (CVP)-guided treatment of patients with acute lung injury also did not receive therapy until a mean of 25 hours after establishment of diagnosis.</P>
<P>In the light of the aforementioned studies and meta-analysis, and the ongoing debate on appropriate use of the PAC, the purpose of the current systematic review was to search for all the available evidence from RCTs and to define the best evidence base for current clinical practice.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-17 02:25:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We used the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(the <I>Handbook</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess the risk of bias for each study. Two authors (SR and MG) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study considering the following seven domains for bias: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias. For each bias we expressed our judgement as: at high risk (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results), low risk (unlikely to seriously alter the results) and unclear risk (raises some doubt about the results) of bias. We also gave the reason for our judgement. Three authors (SR, MG and AK) resolved disagreements by reviewing the data together.</P>
<P>We agreed that complete blinding of the treating physicians may not be feasible at the bedside, but the investigator could be blinded. If the investigator was blinded or did not participate in patient care, we agreed that those studies were at low risk for performance bias. If it was a single centre study and investigators and the treating physicians were the same person, we agreed that performance bias was at high risk. We agreed that blinding of outcome assessment was feasible in studies such as in a multicentre trial if the outcome assessor did not participate in patient care.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bender-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bender 1997</LINK>) did not report all the details of the outcome measures postoperatively for the control group and we judged the study as at high risk of selective reporting bias in the analysis.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-26 00:43:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We used Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (&#967;<SUP>2</SUP>) to assess whether observed differences in results were compatible with chance alone. A large Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic relative to its degree of freedom provides evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effects (variation in effect estimates beyond chance). For quantifying inconsistency we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to describe the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). An I<SUP>2</SUP> of 0% to 40% might not be important, 30% to 60% was moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% was substantial heterogeneity and 75% to 100% was interpreted as considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When the heterogeneity was low in the outcome measures meta-analysis was considered appropriate.</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was explored by conducting subgroup analysis. To incorporate heterogeneity among studies random-effects model meta-analysis was used. We did not exclude any studies based on conflicting results, which minimized heterogeneity. We performed sensitivity analysis with and without any potential outlying studies. We did not perform meta-regression to investigate heterogeneity in a subgroup analysis due to low sample size of the subgroups.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-12-26 00:46:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We summarized the aims, methods and outcome measures of interest (mortality, LOS in ICU and hospital, and costs of care). We expressed mortality as absolute numbers and percentages, and we expressed LOS as mean, median, and range for survivors and non-survivors reported separately. The primary outcome measure of interest was in-hospital mortality at any time; if this was not reported, we used the mortality at the point closest to hospital discharge. We expressed results on costs of care in a range of measures. The secondary outcome measures were ICU and hospital LOS and cost of care.</P>
<P>We calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality across studies and mean days for LOS using a random-effects model in RevMan 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.1</LINK>). All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Among the five studies that reported various costs, only two studies reported the hospital cost and a fixed-effect model was used to analyse the cost.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pearson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pearson 1989</LINK>) allowed patients to cross-over to the PAC group after randomization due to ethical reasons. We combined the number of patients in the PAC group for mortality analysis and reported the hospital LOS separately. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Guyatt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Guyatt 1991</LINK>) allowed sicker patients to cross-over to the PAC group. We did not perform paired-analysis due to the low number of recruitments. The weights of these two studies were low in the meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-12-17 15:12:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients admitted to ICU are a heterogeneous group in terms of diagnosis, prognosis and resource utilization. This heterogeneity exists both among patients within a single ICU and among the case mix of patients admitted to medical and surgical ICUs. Therefore, we performed subgroup analysis combining data from studies that had included patient populations with similar characteristics. We did subgroup analysis of mortality separately in general intensive care patients, high-risk surgical patients, and studies of perioperative monitoring to investigate the effect of the heterogeneity of the studies. We analysed ICU LOS and hospital LOS separately for surgical and medical patients.</P>

<P>1. General ICU studies: we included five studies of general intensive care patients with varying diagnoses (acute lung injury (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>); acute ventilatory failure (<LINK REF="STD-Guyatt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Guyatt 1991</LINK>); shock (<LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2003</LINK>)); and one study of patients admitted to the ICU requiring PAC insertion as deemed appropriate by the attending physician (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>We analysed seven domains of potential risk of bias for the included studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). We rated blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment at high risk in half of the included studies and at low risk in one third of the studies. Regardless of the high risk of performance bias, these studies were included because of the low weight of the studies in the meta-analysis. We rated three quarters of the studies at low risk of selection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). We performed a sensitivity analysis by removing all the trials that had high and unclear risk of bias and the results remained the same. Publication bias appeared to be unlikely as the funnel plot is symmetric, which also confirms the absence of effect of study size on the outcome (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

However, if treating physicians and patient care decision makers were not the investigators, performance bias could be minimized.</P>
<P>Four studies were at low risk for blinding of participants or performance bias due to the multicentre nature of the study or investigators were not the providers (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>). Five studies were at high risk for performance bias. One study, even though a multicentre trial, was protocol driven and allowed the PAC patients to change over to a CVC at the discretion of the treating physician (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the intervention under study meant that complete blinding of outcome was not feasible, however detection bias could be minimized if the investigator and treating physician were different personnel. Performance bias and detection bias shared similar high and unclear risks in all the studies except in one study. Berlauk et al (<LINK REF="STD-Berlauk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berlauk 1991</LINK>) had low risk because investigators (anaesthesiologists) were involved for a short period of the first 18 hours only and were unlikely to have influenced the mortality or hospital LOS thereafter. Two studies gave insufficient information and the risk was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valentine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Valentine 1998</LINK>). Four studies were at low risk (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>).

The FACTT study (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>) was at high risk for detection bias because only weaning of vasopressors were under protocol management and not fluid management, which may have influenced the mortality and LOS outcomes.</P>

The overall outcome did not change with sensitivity analysis, by eliminating any single study. Large studies had almost similar weights and smaller studies had similar low weights, and no single study altered the weight of the analysis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-17 15:13:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We identified 13 RCTs with 5686 patients assessing mortality, hospital and ICU LOS and cost effectiveness of PAC in ICUs (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Five of these studies investigated the clinical effectiveness of PACs in the management of general intensive care patients. The remaining eight studies studied high-risk surgical patients. Of these surgical patients, five trials investigated whether preoperative optimization of haemodynamics improved patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Bender-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bender 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berlauk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berlauk 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoemaker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shoemaker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valentine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Valentine 1998</LINK>). In these studies, placement of a PAC was part of a package of care that also included admission to ICU preoperatively and optimization of haemodynamics to predetermined goals. Because patients admitted to ICU are a heterogeneous group, we performed subgroup analysis for studies of elective high-risk surgery patients (perioperative monitoring with and without preoperative optimization) and studies of general intensive care patients. Studies which had the potential for some aspects of high risk of bias had low weight due to small numbers of patients and were included because of their limited effect on the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>We could not demonstrate any beneficial or harmful effects of PACs on mortality, hospital LOS and cost of care in either patients in general ICUs or a subgroup of high-risk surgical patients. Pulmonary artery catheterization did not affect ICU LOS in general intensive care unit patients (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies).</P>
<P>A subgroup meta-analysis of five preoperative surgical studies suggested that preoperative optimization guided by a PAC did not improve or worsen the outcome in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. This meta-analysis was heavily weighted (85.5% weight) by the Sandham et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>) as this was the largest RCT and had low risk for bias. Sensitivity analysis did not change the mortality results. The overall mortality outcome was similar in both the PAC group and the CVC group.</P>
<P>Four US based studies demonstrated that the overall hospital cost billed for the PAC group was higher than for the CVC group. Two of these studies qualified for analysis and did not show statistically significant hospital cost differences.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-12-17 06:05:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The review question is 'Does the use of PAC in ICUs lead to increased mortality, hospital or ICU LOS and cost?'. PAC is a diagnostic and monitoring tool, not a treatment intervention for any given clinical condition. Use of PAC does not increase or decrease mortality, ICU LOS or hospital LOS. It is appropriate to use in selected patients, by intensive care physicians, as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to guide patient care decisions. Cost effectiveness varies among countries with different healthcare systems. Our analysis on cost cannot be generalized or applied widely. This current evidence is a complete review of all available RCTs to date. It is unlikely that a large prospective RCT comparing PAC with CVC will be published in the future. There are several less invasive methods of haemodynamic monitoring, and their comparison with PAC is beyond the scope of this review. Regardless, the applicability of this evidence of no effect on mortality is strong in the ICUs. A PAC is however a diagnostic tool and its impact on management must not be interpreted with regard to mortality outcomes in adults in intensive care. Shock reversal, improvement in organ dysfunction and less vasopressor use are other potential outcome measures that need to be studied.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Barriers in evaluation of the PAC</HEADING>
<P>One of the main barriers to an effective evaluation of the PAC in intensive care has been the lack of equipoise amongst intensive care clinicians. The training, expertise in PAC measurements, utilization of PAC data for clinical decisions and management of patients vary widely among clinicians. Iberti et al found that providers have significant gaps in their knowledge and expertise in utilizing PAC data (<LINK REF="REF-Iberti-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberti 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iberti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberti 1994</LINK>). He reported, from a study done in US and Canada, that the physician&#8217;s knowledge, understanding, use and interpretation of PAC data were 67% correct, with a range of 19% to 100%. Mean scores varied by training, frequency of insertion and use of PAC data in patient treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Iberti-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberti 1990</LINK>). Among nurses the test scores of knowledge and use of PAC were associated with years of experience in critical care, critical care registered nurse certification, responsibility for repositioning and manipulating the catheter, frequency of use, and self-assessed adequacy of knowledge (<LINK REF="REF-Iberti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iberti 1994</LINK>). A similar study done in Australia utilizing the same questionnaire also found that the test scores were significantly associated with years of experience in intensive care, number of PACs inserted and the physician's certification (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence is clear that physicians' and nurses' understanding of PAC and its utility vary widely, making credentialing policies and competency assessments essential. Lack of clinical expertise using PACs may have played a role in patient outcomes in our meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Use of the PAC in clinical practice</HEADING>
<P>The PAC has been used in various clinical settings and our study did not address its use in cardiac catheterization laboratories, coronary care units or in cardiac pacing. One important use of the PAC is to differentiate various types of shock and to guide therapy. The objective of our analysis was not provider satisfaction, knowledge and comfort level on using PAC; however, these are important considerations in utilizing a diagnostic tool for accomplishing clinically significant results. Lack of any significant mortality improvement from PAC use can be attributed to several factors. A diagnostic and monitoring device that has no therapeutic applications cannot modify outcomes unless the information gathered is utilized appropriately. The aforementioned studies on physicians' and nurses' knowledge on PAC and its applicability, correct interpretation of waveforms, effective utilization of the measured and derived data, and management strategies based on the information gathered vary widely. The significant decline in the clinical utility of PAC in recent years may have caused poor training and expertise, which could lead to occasional delayed utility during the terminal stages of the disease process and improper interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2007</LINK>). Proper use of a PAC depends upon a thorough understanding of factors contributing to measurement errors and data interpretation. The PAC provides a wealth of potentially useful haemodynamic information to the clinicians, and it is only if this information is utilized correctly that it may be helpful in patient management (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Advantages of the PAC</HEADING>
<P>During current clinical practice many clinicians still seek haemodynamic data to manage critically ill patients. For this reason, a variety of non-invasive monitoring devices have been introduced and compared with PAC as the reference standard to evaluate the test performance. PACs allow measurement of haemodynamic variables that cannot be measured reliably or continuously by less invasive monitoring devices (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2009</LINK>). The PAC has the added benefit of being useful as a multilumen infusion port, in addition to its utilization as a monitoring and data-gathering device. Critically ill patients require multiple drips and the current standard of practice is to provide central venous access using a CVC. A PAC is also placed through a central access and shares the same short-term complications related to line insertion; however, it has several advantages in addition to intracardiac monitoring. Newer versions of PACs (for example Swan-Ganz flow-directed catheters) provide rapid and effective monitoring of right heart pressures and have the capability to measure mixed venous oxygen saturation, perform cardiac pacing, and to assess the pulmonary vasculature by injecting contrast media to do selective angiographic studies (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-Lifesciences-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards Lifesciences 2012</LINK>). The studies included in our analysis used a standard PAC.</P>
<P>The PAC also has a pivotal role in the measurement of central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO<SUB>2</SUB>). The measurement of ScVO<SUB>2</SUB> is crucial in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Rivers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivers 2001</LINK>). ScVO<SUB>2</SUB> is obtained through the measurement of oxygen saturation in venous blood returning to the heart and is representative of the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. A recent study showed that both low and high ScVO<SUB>2</SUB> values obtained in the emergency department were associated with increased mortality in sepsis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 2010</LINK>) thus underlining the importance of continuous ScVO2 monitoring via either a PAC or ScVO<SUB>2</SUB> catheter.</P>

<P>The quality of evidence from this review for the mortality outcome in this population is robust. Using the Cochrane Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the evidence was high for hospital and ICU LOS but was low for cost analysis. Only RCTs were included in the meta-analysis but many observational studies, meta-analyses and systematic reviews, cohort studies, and grey literature were examined as sources to identify RCTs. A complete risk of bias analysis and sensitivity analysis minimized uncertainties and provided concrete evidence based support. We had limitations in analysing the secondary outcomes (hospital LOS, ICU LOS and cost) because only some of the studies reported them. This was particularly so for cost effectiveness, which was reported in four studies. We performed subgroup analysis for general intensive care patients and high-risk surgical patients, and the results did not vary significantly. Overall, the internal validity and quality of evidence is high (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-12-17 06:10:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>One potential bias is the fact that this is an update from a previous review and may have been influenced by previous conclusions. Another source of bias may be that the two groups of review authors are from the same institution and may have similar backgrounds. To overcome these potential biases four authors (SH, DY, WB and KR) from the original review participated in the update. We did not include studies that used PAC in other areas such as in heart failure patients and coronary care units due to the inclusion criteria and the different primary end points in the studies, but we have included these details in the discussion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of the PAC</HEADING>
<P>Evaluation of  the clinical effectiveness of managing general intensive care patients with a PAC was addressed by the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>) and Pac-Man studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2005</LINK>); both are major clinical trials with relatively low risks of bias. Both trials were adequately powered multicentre RCTs with over 1000 patients each, in North America and Europe (USA, Canada and UK). Their data on harms or complications of PAC have been conflicting. The results of the FACTT suggested an increased rate of complications from PAC insertion, as opposed to the Pac-Man study which concluded no harm from PAC insertion. The results do, however, agree with the findings of previous smaller studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guyatt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Guyatt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2003</LINK>) that PACs do not appear to confer survival advantage, nor do they reduce hospital length of stay or costs of care. Both these trials disagreed with the excess mortality findings reported by Connors et al (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>) and showed that management with a PAC did not worsen the outcome in critically ill patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evaluation of efficacy of the PAC</HEADING>
<P>FACTT (<LINK REF="STD-NHLBI-2006" TYPE="STUDY">NHLBI 2006</LINK>) was the only trial which evaluated the efficacy of the PAC, but it did not address the ongoing debate as to whether the use of a PAC as a diagnostic device and monitoring tool can be responsible for adverse patient outcomes, especially because it is not a therapeutic intervention. One may argue that adverse outcomes may be related to complications of the procedure, but rather they appear to be from inadequate training and skills in utilizing the data and the lack of clinical expertise and approved treatment protocols with the use of a PAC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">PAC monitoring coupled with therapy</HEADING>
<P>There is mounting evidence for the preemptive strategy of haemodynamic monitoring with a PAC coupled with therapy to reduce surgical mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2011</LINK>). Hamilton et al in their systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 trials involving 4805 patients that had perioperative haemodynamic manipulation, which included a PAC with other interventions, reported significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78, P = 0.0002) and surgical complications. Gurgel et.al performed another meta-analysis of studies involving high-risk surgical patients with the use of a PAC to maintain tissue perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Gurgel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurgel 2011</LINK>). This study of 32 RCTs comprising 5056 high-risk surgical patients showed a significant reduction in mortality rate (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95 CI% 0.55 to 0.70, P &lt; 0.00001) and postoperative organ dysfunction when a haemodynamic protocol was used to maintain tissue perfusion. Brienza et al published a meta-analysis of 20 studies with 4220 patients and found that perioperative haemodynamic optimization significantly reduced postoperative acute renal injury and the need for renal replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>). These studies suggest that haemodynamic monitoring with a PAC and intervention in surgical subgroups of patients have significant clinical value, with improved organ dysfunction and mortality reduction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Studies in agreement</HEADING>
<P>A meta-analysis of major morbidities from 12 RCTs involving the use of a PAC showed a very small reduction in morbidity with the PAC (<LINK REF="REF-Ivanov-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivanov 2000</LINK>). Another meta-analysis that examined the relationship of outcomes and resuscitation therapies showed that in studies of severely ill patients, PAC insertion provided a mortality benefit when haemodynamic optimization was performed prior to organ failure, and that there were no differences in outcomes when the PAC was utilized in less critically ill patients or following the onset of multiorgan failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kern-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2002</LINK>). Similar results were reported in a meta-analysis by Shah et al that used wider inclusion criteria for studies including heart failure patients (mortality OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2; and hospital LOS MD 0.11 days, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.74) (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2005</LINK>). Two RCTs included in the Shah meta-analysis were studies of perioperative monitoring. One study showed no difference in mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Bonazzi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bonazzi 2002</LINK>) and the other study showed a significant reduction in mortality (2.9% in PAC group versus 29% in controls) (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>). The ESCAPE trial had advanced heart failure patients who were admitted to coronary care units and the therapeutic goals were different, looking at the days alive out of hospital during the first six months, quality of life, biochemical and echocardiographic changes (<LINK REF="REF-ESCAPE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESCAPE 2005</LINK>). These studies also concluded that PAC use did not change the overall mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cost effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>Four of the 13 studies included a cost component based on hospital charges to patients, and were conducted in US hospitals. One of the problems with this approach is that specific charges vary across hospitals, and patients may not be charged the same for the cost of daily monitoring with a PAC. All the studies reported that, on average, total costs were higher for patients managed with PACs compared with those managed without. The cost effectiveness evaluation for the PAC-Man study (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2005</LINK>) provided data based on UK practice. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the secondary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The authors concluded that withdrawal of PACs from routine clinical use in ICUs within the NHS may be considered cost effective. These cost effectiveness analyses of a PAC compared to CVC cannot be broadly applied to the current clinical practice. Cost varies across countries, regions, healthcare systems and types of catheters used. Cost effectiveness cannot be generalized to different populations, particularly for medical and surgical patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other haemodynamic monitoring devices</HEADING>
<P>Clinicians are still looking for haemodynamic monitoring tools without the known complications of the PAC. Newer cardiac output catheters are already being used in ICUs to provide haemodynamic measurements based on arterial contour power and pulse power analyses. The examples of catheters which use a different calibration scheme for measurement of cardiac output (CO) are the lithium indicator dilution calibration system (LiDCO plus<SUP>TM</SUP>), which uses a transthoracic lithium dilution estimate of cardiac output (CO) for calibration; PiCCO plus<SUP>TM</SUP> uses trans-thoracic thermodilution differences in arterial compliance; whereas flow Trac<SUP>TM</SUP> calculates CO from the pulse contour using a proprietary algorithm (<LINK REF="REF-Hadian-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadian 2007</LINK>). These catheters cannot be used as infusion ports, available with the PAC. These catheters are preferably inserted into a large calibre artery like the femoral artery, which is again invasive and associated with complications, and are attached to monitors which perform arterial power analysis and pulse power analysis. The need for frequent recalibration is a potential disadvantage of these newer techniques. These techniques of measurement are relatively new and will require validation in comparison to PAC in large-scale randomized trials for their effectiveness in therapy in ICUs.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-12-17 06:37:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review concentrated specifically on patients admitted to ICUs. This meta-analysis concluded that use of a PAC alone, without a properly designed therapeutic strategy based on haemodynamic data, did not affect mortality, ICU LOS, hospital LOS or cost in adult ICUs. It is important to note that the PAC itself is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool and not a therapeutic intervention to achieve any major clinical outcomes. It is not a harmful tool and may be used successfully for diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring in ICU patients by highly trained specialists (critical care physicians, cardiologists, anaesthesiologists) with appropriate training in interpretation of the PAC variables, and its applicability in specific clinical scenarios has been shown in recent studies of surgical patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-17 06:41:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Efficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal, PAC-guided management protocols which, when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs, could result in benefit. Shock reversal, improved organ dysfunction and vasopressor use are other potential outcome measures that need to be studied. In high-risk surgical patients, preemptive haemodynamic monitoring with PAC coupled with therapy has shown significant reduction in mortality and organ dysfunction (for example improved renal function) in recent meta-analyses ( <LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurgel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurgel 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the reasons that PAC use in general ICUs has been diminishing in recent years may be due to the increased availability of sophisticated and less invasive devices to monitor cardiac output. These are devices based on trans-oesophageal Doppler, lithium dilution, pulse contour analysis, thoracic impedance and carbon dioxide rebreathing. One explanation for the lack of benefit arising from PAC use was that there was no additional survival advantage gained from a more detailed knowledge of haemodynamics, and this was particularly true when there was no protocol driven management strategy associated with that information. Similarly, the new devices need careful scrutiny before they replace the PAC as another unevaluated 'reference standard', especially when they only serve as diagnostic tools.</P>
