<TITLE>Not enough evidence to show if anti-cancer drugs before and after surgery increase survival in liver cell cancer patients</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-17 13:57:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma, the commonest primary cancer of the liver is the sixth most common cancer in the world. According to the World Health Organization, most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma occur in Asia and Africa, however recent reports suggest that the incidence of primary liver cancer is also increasing in several developed countries, mainly in the Unites States and Europe. In Southeast Asia and Africa, hepatocellular carcinoma is predominantly associated with hepatitis B virus infection, whereas in Western countries and Japan it is associated with infection due to hepatitis C virus.</P>
<P>For hepatocellular carcinoma, surgery is the main form of treatment, but it is only possible for a small proportion of those afflicted. Even after curative resection, recurrence is common and is the main cause of death. Adjuvant (that is, chemotherapy after surgery) and neo-adjuvant therapy (that is, chemotherapy before surgery) are thus attempted to try to improve outcomes.</P>
<P>This review sets on to determine the efficacy and adverse events of different neoadjuvant therapies (drug given before) versus adjuvant therapies (drug given after) compared to surgery alone, or surgery and placebo or supportive therapy when given to improve relapse and survival rates for operable hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 12 randomised trials were identified, totaling 843 patients. The size of the randomised clinical trials ranged from 30 to 155 patients. Nine of the twelve trials reported no survival benefit from adjuvant therapy. Two trials reported a significant difference for survival and four studies for disease-free survival for the treatment group, but the results of one of the trials on both its groups were very poor when compared to other trials. Two of the trials that did not report any absolute survival advantage reported statistically significant differences in disease-free survival. The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5- fluorouracil which resulted in 12 out of 38 patients being withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this review found insufficient evidence to show that adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy increase survival from hepatocellular carcinoma, but there is limited evidence to suggest that neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be useful for disease-free survival.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-19 15:22:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>A total of 12 randomised trials were identified, totaling 843 patients. The size of the randomised clinical trials ranged from 30 to 155 patients. Both preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant), systemic and locoregional (+/- embolisation), chemo- and immunotherapy interventions were tested. Treatment regimens and patients selected were not comparable, so no pooling was done. Only one regimen using preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation with doxorubicin was similar in two trials. Four of the twelve trials reported survival benefit at five years when given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Disease-free survival was reported in nine trials, and the estimated hazard ratios show that disease-free survival was significant in two trials at five years. These two trials had not shown a survival advantage, but the recurrence was significantly lower in patients given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluorouracil which resulted in 12 out of 38 patients being withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-19 15:21:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma, the commonest primary cancer of the liver is an important disease entity and is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with more than half a million new cases reported annually (<LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lovet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lovet 2008</LINK>). According to the World Health Organization, most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma occur in Asia. East Asia particularly have a very high incidence (over 20 cases per 100,000 population). Another region of concern is sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly the western region of Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Gomaa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomaa 2008</LINK>). The incidence of primary liver cancer is also increasing in the Unites States as well as in high-income Euroepan countries (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Serag-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Serag 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lovet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lovet 2008</LINK>). In Southeast Asia and Africa, hepatocellular carcinoma is predominantly associated with hepatitis B virus infection, whereas in Western countries and Japan it is associated with infection due to hepatitis C virus. Other risk factors include toxic (alcohol and aflatoxins), metabolic (diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hereditary haemochromatosis), and immune-related (primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis).</P>
<P>Curative treatments currently in use include surgical (either hepatic resection or liver transplantation), or local ablation, either radiofrequency or percutaneous ethanol injection (<LINK REF="REF-Lovet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lovet 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1985</LINK>). Surgical resection remains one of the treatment modalities that offers the possibility of long-term survival for patients with a non-cirrhotic liver or selected patients with hepatic cirrhosis and well preserved hepatic function or who are unsuitable for liver transplantation (Lee 1982; Okuda 1985; <LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2008</LINK>), but less than 10% of patients are operable at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Oon-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oon 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Even after resection, the rate of disease recurrence is extremely high, and recurrence of complications is up to 70% of the cases at 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Huguet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huguet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forner 2006</LINK> ). Some studies on resected clinical hepatocellular carcinoma report a one-year survival of around 55% (48% to 81%) and three-year survival of around 30% (24% to 48%) (<LINK REF="REF-Nagourney-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagourney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1987</LINK>). Distant metastases occur locally in the remaining liver. It is generally believed that recurrences arise not because of inadequate resection, but because of pre-existing microscopic tumour foci that are undetected by imaging modalities or because of malignant cells that have been disseminated during surgical manipulation (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelstein 2003</LINK>). This general belief is the motivation for attempting neoadjuvant (pre-operative) and adjuvant (post-operative) therapies to supplement surgery.</P>
<P>This review was first published in 1999 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the authors concluded that 'there was no clear evidence for efficacy of any of the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant protocols reviewed, but there was some evidence to suggest that adjuvant therapy might be beneficial for prolonged disease-free survival (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1999</LINK>). Conclusions from the review showed that clinical trial results published until 1999 did not show a clear picture on the effectiveness of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in patients who underwent liver resection. Subsequently, a review was published in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2002</LINK>) concluding that 'systemic and hepatic-artery chemotherapy or chemoembolisation have not been shown to improve overall or disease-free survival after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma'. Therefore, the objective of undertaking this update was to review the emerging status of evidence after 1999 (after the publication of the Cochrane review), to determine the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies before or after liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.</P>

<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>A pool of abstracts of potentially relevant trials were first screened for neoadjuvant and adjuvant randomised clinical trials and controlled clinical trials. Three authors, ES-YC, PK-HC, and SM, independently screened the full text of selected trials to confirm eligibility, assess quality, and extract data. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality </B>
<BR/>We followed the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and The <I>Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2008</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with unclear or inadequate methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>), we assessed the influence of methodological quality of the trials on the trial results by evaluating the reported randomisation and follow-up procedures in each trial. If information was not available in the published trial, we contacted the authors in order to assess the trials correctly. We assessed the following components:</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence</I>
</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice was considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. Due to the small number of clinical trials on operable hepatocellular carcinoma, quasi-randomised studies were included in the review.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding</I>
</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described as single or double-blind, and the method of blinding involved identical placebo or active drug.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as blinded, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not single or double-blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up</I>
</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>ITT Analysis</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Trial participants should be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised regardless of which (or how much) treatment they actually received, and regardless of other protocol irregularities, such as ineligibility.</LI>
<LI>All participants should be included regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other criteria, which were considered were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sample size calculations reported in studies</LI>
<LI>Comparability between treatment groups based on baseline characteristics reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis<BR/>
</B>We conducted the meta-analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We used the software package RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration for analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>For trials, which did not report the hazard ratio (HR) or had insufficient information for it to be estimated, several surrogate measures characterising the survival experience of each group in a trial were extracted from the published survival curves and tabulated [Cumulative survival rates reported using Kaplan-Meir method and the significance of differences between groups assessed by log-rank test and Wilcoxon tests]. Trials for which there was sufficient information, HR was calculated by using approximation methods as described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. Pooling of results was not done because we judged a priori that the studies were too heterogenous and because of the lack of a suitable summary estimate of effect, ie, the HR).</P>
<P>The calculated hazard ratios (HR) were entered as generic inverse variance data on a logarithmic scale to produce the forest plot.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-11-19 15:22:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>A total of 12 studies were included totaling 843 participants, of which one was a Chinese language article (<LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>) identified from the <I>Chinese Biomedical Database</I>. One study was reported initially as a brief communication and then published again in the following years with complete data (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>). The total number of patients in the studies ranged from 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>) to 155 (<LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>). However, only three studies reported sample size calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>) with 30 participants was stopped prematurely after an interim analysis was done showing that there was a significant improvement in the disease-free survival outcome. The polyprenoic acid study of <LINK REF="STD-Muto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Muto 1996</LINK> and interferon study of <LINK REF="STD-Ikeda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ikeda 2000</LINK> were excluded because the control and treatment groups comprised an unknown/known proportion of curative surgical resection and percutaneous ethanol injection patients (the authors clearly favour the latter in their discussion). It was also primarily concerned with the prevention of onset of a second primary tumour and not absolute survival, whereas the objective of the studies included in this review was to improve the absolute survival after the resection of the original primary. Two other trials, which were excluded from the review, were Chinese language articles (<LINK REF="STD-Bao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>). They did not meet our inclusion criteria (See Characteristics of excluded studies).</P>
<P>Apart from the fact that participants had hepatocellular carcinoma regarded as curatively resectable and had reasonable liver function tests, Child A/B (<LINK REF="REF-Child-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Child 1964</LINK>), Okuda I/II (<LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1984</LINK>), the entry criteria varied and were not easily compared. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>) specified participants with small tumours (2 to 5 cm), one (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK>) specified participants with only large tumours (more than 10 cm), one study included tumours ranging from less than 5 cm to more than 10 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>), and the rest did not place any restriction on tumour size.</P>
<P>All studies compared a surgery-only group against surgery combined with chemotherapy that was given either preoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>), postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>), or pre- and postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK>). Izumi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>) was the only study with two adjuvant groups: with and without gelatin sponge embolisation for participants having good and poor liver function results (following surgery), respectively. Both Lygidakis' studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK>) used slightly different, but complex regimens of locoregional chemo- and immunotherapy before and after surgery. The connection between these two studies is unclear, but they appear to be independent studies. We contacted its authors for clarification on 17th April 2007, but have not received an answer until now. Lygidakis is the first and only common author, but the later study (91 patients, two authors) does not cite the earlier one (40 patients, four authors).</P>
<P>Only the two neoadjuvant studies of <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> had similar interventions. Both used locoregional chemoembolisation (specifically transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation) with doxorubicin. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> reported an average delay until surgery in the neoadjuvant group of about four weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> did not report this figure. The other neoadjuvant study <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK> used transcatheter chemoembolisation with a combination of two or three interventions of either (mitomycin C) MMC 10 mg, 5Fu50 mg to 200 mg, EPIR 6 mg to 10 mg, or Carcbo platin 300 mg to 500 mg. The mean time to surgery was 47.2±52.8 days (shortest was two weeks and the longest was 11 months).</P>
<P>Among the pure adjuvant trials, <LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK> used transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with good liver function, lipiodol, doxorubicin, mitomycin followed by getain sponge cubes or chemotherapy without embolisation, lipiodol, doxorubicin and mitomycin, <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK> used a combination of systemic epirubicin and locoregional cisplatin, <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> used oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluoracil (HCFU), <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK> used systemic and locoregional epirubicin and oral HCFU, <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> used 1850 MBq lipiodol-Iodine-131, <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> used adoptive immunotherapy, and <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> used interferon-alpha. Eight of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>) mentioned that patients with recurrent cancers were given additional therapy independent of their randomised treatment.</P>
<P>Absolute and disease-free (recurrence-free) survival experience in all studies were reported using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, except for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK> reported only mean survival times and survival percentages at some unspecified time, and <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK> reported only the absolute survival curves. <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK> reported only two-year survival rate and time to recurrence. <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> reported survival curves separately stratified for clinical stage I and II of liver cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-LCSG-Japan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">LCSG Japan 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> studies reported hazard ratios (HR) in addition to the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> study, reported HRs of overall survival and disease-free survival of interim analysis and after the completion of the study. Only eight studies reported survival and recurrence rates at five years.</P>
<P>All studies, except <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>, reported adverse events (see Characteristics of included studies). The most notable number and severity of adverse events were seen in <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> (oral HCFU) where 12 out of 38 participants in the adjuvant group stopped treatment. Interestingly, the <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK> study, which also used oral HCFU, did not report such severe adverse events. In <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> study, 59% of the patients had adverse events of grade 1 or 2 and were treated as outpatients, of which five patients had more than one adverse event. None of the patients had pulmonary or renal symptoms, or any sign of infection, hepatic functional deterioration, or immune disorder. Treatment adherence was also satisfactory (97%). In <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> study, treatment could not be completed in 3 patients because of depression, severe general fatigue, and renal abscess.<BR/>
<BR/>Studies, which looked at the effectiveness of nutrition before and after surgery on survival and recurrence rates, were excluded from this review.</P>

<P>All the studies were described as randomised, but exceptionally few details were given. All 12 trials were randomised clinical trials, but only four trials are of high quality, ie, assessed as trials having low risk of bias, based on adequate concealment of allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK> reported using sealed envelopes, while <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> used central office randomisation (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of all the trials, only two trials were blinded. In <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> study, investigators and the radiologists responsible to check the recurrence were blinded, while in <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> study only the radiologists were blinded to the treatment allocation.</P>
<P>Patient numbers were generally small, ranging from 15 to 79 per intervention group. <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> were the only three studies to justify the sample size used by an explicit statement of the expected treatment effect, power, and significance level. In all studies, both groups appeared reasonably balanced for other measured variables.</P>
<P>The best criteria for adequacy of resection seemed to be that used by <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>. These three studies used the criterion negative by imaging one month after surgery. Participants who qualified were then randomised to no further therapy or adjuvant therapy. This approach is obviously only applicable to post-operative regimens.</P>
<P>Two studies reported interval estimates of treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>). The exception <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK> did not provide any survival curves and only used an inappropriate statistic - the mean survival time to compare the treatments. This study also reported survival percentages but at unspecified time points. This was in contrast with the reporting in <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK>, which did provide the survival curves. However, in this study, the authors measured the time until death from the time of surgery in both groups. This, however, has the potential for introducing bias because the adjuvant treatment in this study actually started prior to surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> trial, recurrence rates and cumulative survival rates were reported until the study end point, from operation until death, which was seven years and six months. <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK> study reported survival and time to recurrence only at two years.</P>

<P>
<B>One-, two-, and three-year survival rates, median survival times, and the result of significance tests for the difference between treatment groups</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>Two studies reported confidence interval of treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>). Therefore, for all other studies we have tabulated the reported or approximate (estimated from the published graphs) point estimates of the one-, two- three-, four-, and five-year survival probabilities, disease-free survival probabilities, median survival time, and median disease-free survival for each treatment group, and the reported P-value of the significance test used to compare the two treatment curves (except for <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK> in which no curves were given) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies, which had sufficient information (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>), hazard ratios for death and recurrence were calculated by using approximate methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> et al and presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>. The hazard ratios calculated by approximate methods are plotted as inverse variance data, but pooling of the data was not possible because of the non-comparability of the studies. The main reason was that the therapies used were different in all the studies. Due to the inconsistencies in the reported and approximate hazard ratios calculated, readers should interpret the forest plot data with caution.</P>
<P>In four studies, risk of death at five years was significantly reduced in patients who had either neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>). On the other hand, two studies showed significant increase in the risk of death; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.55 to 9.04) and <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>, Analysis 1.3, (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.32). Overall, recurrence showed more consistent results across studies favouring neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment groups with patients who underwent operation alone. A significant reduction in recurrence compared to the operation alone group at five years was, however, observed only in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> reported a significant increase in risk of recurrence compared to the surgical group (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.01 to 8.08).</P>
<P>At four years, the risk of death decreased significantly in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK> (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50); <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.53); <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.49)) in patients who underwent adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy compared to patients who did not have any therapy. A similar reduction in recurrence was observed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK> study, however, reported a significant increase in recurrence in patients who underwent therapy in addition to operation (HR 14.88, 95% CI 3.35 to 65.99), and the results were significant.</P>
<P>The reported results and the calculated hazard ratios for death and recurrence varied in some studies due to inconsistency in statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK>, it was reported that cumulative survival rates were not different between groups, but the approximation method used by us showed statistical significance (graph 1.03 (HR 0.39 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96)) and in <LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK> study, the difference in survival rates and recurrence rates were reported to be insignificant between the two groups, but by the approximation method it is found to be significant <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.32); <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> (HR 0.0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67)) at five years.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> study reported HR of survival and disease-free survival at interim analysis, we used only data reported at the end of the study.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluorouracil (<LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>) which resulted in 12 out of 38 (31.5%) participants stopping because of adverse events: neuropathy, liver dysfunction, exanthema and diarrhoea. Unspecified treatments were given to all patients. Another trial, which used postoperative hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with epirubicin and oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluorouracil, reported three severe adverse events (atrial fibrillation, severe appetite loss) resulting in withdrawal from the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ono-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ono 1997</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-19 15:22:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>This review analyses 12 randomised clinical trials of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy versus no such therapy for the improvement of survival as a supplement to curative resection of non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Various regimens ranging from the relatively simple (<LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK>) to the complex (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK>), covering neoadjuvant and adjuvant, systemic and locoregional (with and without embolisation), chemo- and immunotherapy were tried. None were comparable in terms of both the participants recruited and the regimen used. The most similar were the neoadjuvant TACE-epirubicin trials of <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK>. However, the patients in <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> had large tumours of at least 10 cm, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> participants had tumours 2 cm to 5 cm in diameter.</P>
<P>Neoadjuvant therapy, targeted at the tumour (locoregional) either via the portal vein or hepatic artery, may reduce the tumour mass and destroy microscopic tumour foci. However, the overall delay in performing surgery may eventually prove to be detrimental. The much poorer performance of the neoadjuvant group (three-year survival: 40% versus 60%) in the <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> study is probably attributable to a combination of delayed surgery and also the large tumours these patients had. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> used a similar protocol, but on patients with smaller tumours. They had much better three-year survival results in both groups compared to <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> (surgery: 85% versus 60%; neoadjuvant: 85% versus 40%), but no details on the extent of operative delay were given in <LINK REF="STD-Yamasaki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamasaki 1996</LINK> study. Locoregional adjuvant therapy is given in the hope of destroying tumour cells released by surgery and any pre-existing microscopic foci in the remaining liver, while systemic therapy is given to destroy any undetected distant metastases.</P>
<P>Most studies reported survival curves except <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK>. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>) reported a statistically significant absolute survival advantage for the neoadjuvant/adjuvant group. No studies except for <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> specified a priori level of clinical significance. In the case of the <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>, the result was not significant either clinically or statistically. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1995</LINK> found a difference favouring the surgery-only group (for reasons already described). Both <LINK REF="STD-Izumi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Izumi 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> (stage I participants) reported significant disease-free survival differences for adjuvant therapy, but no difference was seen for absolute survival. The recent <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> studies reported a statistically and clinically significant disease-free survival in patients treated with lipiodol-iodine-131 and immunotherapy, respectively at four-years. In <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> study, overall survival rate did not differ significantly between the groups, but the patients in <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> study had a significant increase in overall survival at four and five years, which is also statistically and clinically relevant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1995</LINK> reported only mean survival time and not survival curves. This is an inappropriate measure of treatment effect because of the skewed nature of the distribution of survival times. They also reported and tested the difference in proportion of disease-free participants, but without defining the time point. This is also inappropriate because the difference in follow-up times between the two groups is not accounted for in such a non-survival analysis. In contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-Lygidakis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lygidakis 1996</LINK> study did report absolute survival curves, and the study found a statistically significant difference for absolute survival, favouring the neoadjuvant/adjuvant group. However, this apparent superiority is deceptive because both group have markedly poorer survival rates when compared to other studies. The surgery-only group had a very low three-year survival rate (15% versus a range of 55% to 85% in the other trials), and the 55% three-year survival rate of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy group was not superior to the survival rates of the surgery-only group in any of the other trials. This conclusion stands, even after accounting for the fact that survival time was shortened by 40 days (treatment actually started 40 days earlier) for the adjuvant group because of the authors' decision to measure death from time of surgery. The quality of life of patients was reported as satisfactory, but no other details were given.</P>
<P>All studies reported survival rate at four or five years, except for <LINK REF="STD-Yunxue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yunxue 1999</LINK>, which reported survival rate at two years. The results show that the risk of death was reduced significantly in the TACE group (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83). The time to recurrence at two years was also longer in TACE group compared to the operations group (mean 7.09±3.27 months versus 4.29±3.29 months).</P>
<P>Except for <LINK REF="STD-Lai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Takayama-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Takayama 2000</LINK> trials, no other study reported sample size computations. This is of concern since small samples mean that not only small, but clinically significant effects could be missed, but as well the protective effect of randomisation against bias from unmeasured confounders is much reduced. Although <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1999</LINK> study had anticipated to recruit 120 patients at the beginning of the study, an interim analysis was done after 30 patients, and in view of the significant improvement in disease-free survival, the study was stopped prematurely after recruitment of 43 patients. If the study had adhered to the original sample size calculation, effectiveness of lipiodol-iodine-131 might have been much clearer and certain than now. In particular, eight of the studies reported a policy of treatment of recurrent disease by whatever means deemed appropriate. If this re-treatment did in fact have a beneficial effect on survival and both groups were balanced for type and proportion of re-treated patients, then this would have the effect of making the two groups more similar, and thus of making it harder to detect an effect of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. However, if there was a significant chance imbalance between the groups of retreated patients (due to small sample size), then this policy could have biased the result in either direction.</P>
<P>Five of the studies did on-treatment analysis rather than ITT analysis. Exclusions were for postoperative surgical death and refusal or inability to take neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. The <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> study did both ITT and on-treatment analysis. This study was unusual for the large number of exclusions: 16 out of 67 participants - eight for non-curative resection (histopathology) and eight for protocol violations (all from the adjuvant group). The resulting P-values from the ITT analysis were ten times larger than that of the on-treatment analysis.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Yamamoto-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yamamoto 1996</LINK> attempted to further control for confounding by analytical means - stratification of patients according to degree of liver dysfunction. Several other possible prognostic confounders, such as pathological tumour stage, tumour capsule, time between adjuvant therapy and surgery, fraction of participants who completed therapy, tumour size, multiplicity, and liver function, might also be usefully controlled by a multivariate analysis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-17 14:27:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:54:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Clinicians should be aware that there is no strong evidence that any of the reviewed neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimens prolong survival or disease-free survival after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Only a few small trials have been done, and none have been independently replicated. There is limited evidence to show that adjuvant therapies, lipiodol-iodine 131 and immunotherapy may have potential benefits on disease-free survival for liver cancer patients with operable hepatocellular carcinoma. Oral HCFU may be associated with frequent adverse events.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-17 14:27:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>One could argue that the time is not ripe for phase III trials and that more early phase trials are needed to define new treatments with better potential efficacy. If limited to current therapies, it is unlikely that a treatment benefit as large as a 50% increase in the three-year survival rate is realistically achievable. Therefore, larger, well-designed randomised clinical trials and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org) are needed in order to detect realistically achievable treatment benefits, which are still of clinical significance. The potential benefits of lipiodol and immunotherapies are encouraging, but more studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness. Quality of life would be an important additional outcome to estimate in view of the fact that presently no demonstrable superiority exists for neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy, but that its administration may be accompanied by objectionable adverse events and would definitely incur additional risks and expense.</P>

No.: CD001199. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001199 we concluded that there was no clear evidence for efficacy of any of the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant protocols reviewed, but there was some evidence to suggest that adjuvant therapy might be beneficial for prolonged disease- free survival. In order to detect a realistic treatment advantage, larger trials would have to be conducted.<BR/>
<BR/>In this present updated version, unlike the statement in our previous review version, benefit for disease-free survival is not clear with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. We could include six new reports on studies published until March 2006. Of these, one trial was published in triplicate. Two studies were interim reports of <LINK REF="STD-Nishiguchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiguchi 2005</LINK> trial. The conclusions drawn from all the trials show a change in the evidence from the earlier report. There is limited evidence to suggest that neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be useful for disease-free survival.<BR/>
