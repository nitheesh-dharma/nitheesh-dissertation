<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hawthorn extract (made from the dried leaves, flowers and fruits of the hawthorn bush) may be used as an oral treatment option for chronic heart failure. In this review, 14 double-blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were found. They did not all measure the same outcomes and several did not explain what other heart failure treatments patients were receiving. Those trials that could be included in a meta-analysis showed improvements in heart failure symptoms and in the function of the heart. The results, therefore, are suggestive of a benefit from hawthorn extract used in addition to conventional treatments for chronic heart failure.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hawthorn extract is advocated as an oral treatment option for chronic heart failure. Also, the German Commission E approved the use of extracts of hawthorn leaf with flower in patients suffering from heart failure graded stage II according to the New York Heart Association. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms as reported in double-blind randomised clinical trials of hawthorn extract compared with placebo for treating patients with chronic heart failure. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1951 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), CINAHL (1982 to June 2006) and AMED (1985 to June 2006). Experts and manufacturers were contacted. Language restrictions were not imposed. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>To be included, studies were required to state that they were randomised, double-blind, and placebo controlled, and used hawthorn leaf and flower extract monopreparations. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently performed the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of methodological quality. Data were entered into RevMan 4.2 software. Results from continuous data were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Where data were suitable for combining, pooled results were calculated. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials met all inclusion criteria and were included in this review. In most of the studies, hawthorn was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Ten trials including 855 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes I to III) provided data that were suitable for meta-analysis. For the physiologic outcome of maximal workload, treatment with hawthorn extract was more beneficial than placebo (WMD (Watt) 5.35, 95% CI 0.71 to 10.00, P &lt; 0.02, n = 380). Exercise tolerance were significantly increased by hawthorn extract (WMD (Watt x min) 122.76, 95% CI 32.74 to 212.78, n = 98). The pressure-heart rate product, an index of cardiac oxygen consumption, also showed a beneficial decrease with hawthorn treatment (WMD (mmHg/min) -19.22, 95% CI -30.46 to -7.98, n = 264). Symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue improved significantly with hawthorn treatment as compared with placebo (WMD -5.47, 95% CI -8.68 to -2.26, n = 239). No data on relevant mortality and morbidity such as cardiac events were reported, apart from one trial, which reported deaths (three in active, one in control) without providing further details. Reported adverse events were infrequent, mild, and transient; they included nausea, dizziness, and cardiac and gastrointestinal complaints. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These results suggest that there is a significant benefit in symptom control and physiologic outcomes from hawthorn extract as an adjunctive treatment for chronic heart failure.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hawthorn extract is among the most popular herbal medicinal products in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breevort-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breevort 1998</LINK>) and in Europe, where it is marketed in some countries as a prescription medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2001</LINK>). Preparations usually contain extract derived from the hawthorn bush (Latin name <I>Crataegus monogyna</I> or <I>Crataegus laevigata</I>). The cardiac properties of the extract have been investigated in pre-clinical experiments suggesting positive inotropic effects (ie.increase the strength of muscular contraction) and increases in coronary blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loew-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loew 1997</LINK>). Clinical studies report an increase in exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and improvement in heart failure related symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Eichst_x00e4_dt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eichstädt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fugh_x002d_Berman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugh-Berman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraft-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraft 2001</LINK>). In most herbal reference texts, hawthorn extract is advocated as an oral treatment option for chronic heart failure (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fetrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fetrow 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rotblatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotblatt 2002</LINK>) and the German Commission E approved the use of extracts of hawthorn leaf with flower for stage II according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 2000b</LINK>). Trials reporting beneficial effects and trials showing no evidence of clinical benefit are available (<LINK REF="STD-F_x00f6_rster-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Förster 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1994</LINK>). To get a fair assessment of the evidence we performed a systematic review. Maximal workload in this context is defined as maximum energy output measured in Watt. Left ventricular ejection fraction is the fraction of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heart beat. Exercise tolerance is energy output per unit time.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of hawthorn extract compared with placebo for treating patients with chronic heart failure. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were described as placebo-controlled and double-blind. Studies that tested hawthorn extract as an adjunctive treatment were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adult patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure and categorised according to the NYHA classification (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 1992</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Oral preparations containing extract of hawthorn leaf and flower as the only component (mono-preparation). Studies assessing the effect of hawthorn extract in addition to other treatments for heart failure were included. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Trials assessing clinical outcome measures related to chronic heart failure (e.g. maximal workload) were included. Of primary interest is the change of baseline to post-treatment data, which was used to assess the difference compared with placebo. We specifically assessed the papers for data on mortality and morbidity such as cardiac events (e.g. heart attacks, angina). Data on the safety of hawthorn extract are described as they are reported in the reviewed trials.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>All publications describing (or which might describe) double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs of hawthorn extract for chronic heart failure were sought through electronic searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1951 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), CINAHL (1982 to June 2006), AMED (1985 to June 2006), and Digital Dissertations. Additionally, manufacturers of hawthorn preparations and experts on the subject were contacted and asked to contribute published and unpublished material (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 1998</LINK>). Handsearches were conducted in conference proceedings (<I>FACT - Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies </I>1996 to 2005), our own collection of papers and medical journals (<I>Phytomedicine</I> 1994 to 2005, <I>Alternative and Complementary Therapies </I>1995 - 2005 and <I>Forschende Komplementärmedizin Klassische Naturheilkunde</I> 1994 to 2005). The bibliographies of all papers located were searched for further trials. No restrictions regarding the language of publication were imposed. The following search strategy was used for all of the above databases:<BR/> <BR/>#1 hawthorn<BR/>#2 crategus<BR/>#3 crataegus<BR/>#4 whitethorn <BR/>#5 weissdorn <BR/>#6 #1 or #2 or #3 or #4 or #5</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Trial selection<BR/>
</B>Two reviewers (MHP, RG) independently screened the title and abstracts from searches on electronic databases to identify those articles relevant to this systematic review. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment. All full text articles were read independently by two reviewers to make a decision on inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and by seeking the opinion of the third reviewer (EE).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment<BR/>
</B>Two reviewers (MHP, RG) independently assessed methodological quality of selected studies. Any differences of opinion was resolved by discussion and consensus reached by discussion with a third reviewer (EE). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Method of treatment assignment or adequacy of the randomisation process</I>
</B>
<BR/>We assessed whether the treatment was assigned by a process that was truly randomised: <BR/>A - adequate sequence generation reported (such as computer generated random numbers and random number tables, whilst inadequate approaches will included the use of alternation, case record numbers, birth dates or days of the week). <BR/>B - did not specify one of the adequate reported methods in (A) but mentioned randomisation method. <BR/>C - other methods of allocation that appear to be biased.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Adequacy of the allocation concealment process </I>
</B>
<BR/>A - adequate measures to conceal allocations. Concealment was deemed adequate where randomisation is centralised or pharmacy-controlled, or where the following were used: serially numbered containers, on-site computer-based systems where assignment is unreadable until after allocation, other methods with robust methods to prevent foreknowledge of the allocation sequence to clinicians and patients. <BR/>B - unclearly concealed trials, in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all, or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A). <BR/>C - inadequately concealed trials, in which method of allocation was not concealed. Inadequate approaches included: the use of alternation, case record numbers, days of the week and open random number lists.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Control of selection bias after treatment assignment</I>
</B>
<BR/>We assessed if all patients entered in the trial and assigned to treatment were included in the analysis, any withdrawals from the trial were listed, and the results were analysed both by the original treatment assignment and by treatment received. We scored as follows: <BR/>A - studies where an intention to treat analysis is possible and few exclusions (with adequate reporting of these exclusions). <BR/>B - studies which reported exclusions as reported in (A), but exclusions were less than 10%. <BR/>C - no reporting of exclusions; exclusions of 10% or more or wide differences in exclusions between groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>A data extraction form was designed to include: design and methodological quality of the study, preparation used (including the concomitant medications), details of the participants (including the NYHA class), dosage and duration of intervention, outcome measures as detailed above and adverse events. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. Additional unpublished data were also obtained by contacting the authors of the paper and the manufactures of the products, who may also have funded the trials. </P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>Quantitative analyses of outcomes were based on 'intention-to-treat' (ITT) analyses as reported by the authors of the original studies (that is, that data from all participants are analysed according to the original group assignment). For continuous data, where data are suitable for combining, pooled weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated, using a random-effects model. For homogeneous data we additionally used the fixe- effect model. Where standard deviations for the mean changes were not available, these data were estimated from the standard deviations for the pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements as recommended by Cochrane Collaboration, using a more conservative correlation coefficient (r = 0.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). One three-arm trial (two dose levels and a placebo control) was treated as two individual trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_HD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (HD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_LD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (LD)</LINK>). The number of the participants in the control group was halved for each comparison to avoid a unit of analysis error. This was not planned in our original protocol but thought to be appropriate for this review. </P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity<BR/>
</B>Because trials found may not have been carried out according to a common protocol there will usually be variations in patient groups, clinical settings, concomitant care etc. Therefore we planned to assess heterogeneity between trial results: forest Plots were visually examined and the presence or absence of overlap in the confidence intervals was noted. Lack of overlap of confidence intervals may indicate heterogeneity. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was performed. Trial data were considered to be heterogeneous if P &lt; 0.10. </P>
<P>
<B>Publication or other bias<BR/>
</B>A funnel plot was carried out to test for the presence of publication bias based on the data for the primary outcome. Publication bias is usually detected by asymmetry of the funnel plot. </P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>
</B>Sensitivity analysis were used to explore the influence on effect size: repeating analysis excluding trials using concomitant medication.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The literature searches identified 30 references that described 28 potentially relevant trials, including one unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1995</LINK>) and one conference abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 2004</LINK>). Thirteen publications were excluded because they were either not randomised and placebo controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Eichst_x00e4_dt-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Eichstädt 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staiger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Staiger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weikl-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weikl 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weng-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Weng 1984</LINK>), did not use monopreparations of extracts of hawthorn leaf with flower (<LINK REF="STD-Czerny-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Czerny 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Degenring-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Degenring 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eiff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eiff 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rietbrock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rietbrock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Von 1994</LINK>), assessed healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="STD-Hellenbrecht-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hellenbrecht 1990</LINK>). One was an ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Holubarsch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holubarsch 2000</LINK>). Sixteen references that described 14 trails involving 1110 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. These trials are described in the characteristics of included studies table. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Conolly-1986" TYPE="STUDY">O'Conolly 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connolly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connolly 1987</LINK>) were cross-over designs, the others were parallel. Trial size ranged from 30 to 209 participants. All trials administered standardised hawthorn extracts. Two brands of hawthorn extract (WS1442 and LI132) were used. Seven of eight trials used hawthorn extract WS 1442, which was standardized to 18.8% oligomeric procyanidins. The daily dose used in these trials ranged between 160 mg to 1800 mg. Reported outcomes included maximal workload, exercise tolerance, pressure-heart rate product, 6-min walk test and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%). Ten trials provided data for meta-analysis. In most of the studies, hawthorn was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment for chronic heart failure. All trials used the NYHA classification to categorise patients. In most trials (n = 9), patients of NYHA II were included. In other trials, patients of NYHA I - II (n = 2), II to III (n=2) or III (n = 1) were included. Mean age of the included patients in each trial ranged from 50 to 74, with a higher overall proportion of female patients (62%). Reported co-morbidities included previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, myocarditis and diabetes mellitus. Ten trials reported the use of concomitant drugs. Diuretics were allowed in four trials and ACE inhibitors were allowed in three trials. Length of the treatment range from 3 to 16 weeks and the longest follow up was 26 weeks. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>As described in the method section, we assessed the methodological quality of included studies in three aspects, i.e. randomisation, allocation concealment and control of selection bias after treatment assignment. Details can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The overall methodological quality varies among studies. Six of 14 trials reported adequate sequence generation, the others only mentioned randomisation in the text. Adequate allocation concealment was reported in only three trials. No allocation concealment approach was reported in the other 11 trials. Four studies used intension-to-treat analysis and had few exclusions. Three trials provided no information on exclusion. The other seven trials reported less than 10% exclusions with reasons for exclusion given. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Of the 14 included trials, maximal workload was the outcome most frequently used. The meta-analysis of trials which reported data on maximal workload (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_digheimer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bödigheimer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanak-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hanak 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_HD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (HD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_LD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (LD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zapfe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zapfe 2001</LINK>), indicated a significant increase in this outcome in patients receiving hawthorn extract compared with patients receiving placebo WMD (Watt) 5.35 (95% CI 0.71 to 10.00, P &lt; 0.02, n = 380). There was no evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.27). Results calculated using a fixed-effect model were almost identical to those obtained using a random-effects model. All trials assessed maximal workload using bicycle ergometry with an increase of 25 Watt every 2 minutes until the patients had to stop. </P>
<P>Visual inspection of the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) showed a degree of asymmetry, but there are too few studies to make any conclusions about publication bias.<BR/> <BR/>Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the main analysis. We assessed trials in which hawthorn extract was administered in addition to other medications (WMD (Watt) 2.9, 95% CI -1.38 to 7.18, n = 282) and trials in which it was unclear whether the patients received any other medications (WMD (Watt) 12.36, 95% CI 3.72 to 21.00, n = 98). </P>
<P>Additional outcome data were available in five other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leuchtgens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leuchtgens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connolly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connolly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Conolly-1986" TYPE="STUDY">O'Conolly 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weikl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Weikl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zapfe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zapfe 2001</LINK>) for the pressure-heart rate product (systolic blood pressure in mm Hg times heart rate per minute and divided by 100) and two trials for exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Hanak-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hanak 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zapfe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zapfe 2001</LINK>). The meta-analysis of these data suggests a reduction of the pressure-heart rate product (WMD (mmHg/min) -19.22, 95% CI -30.46 to -7.98, n=264) and an increase in exercise tolerance (WMD (Watt x min) 122.76, 95% CI 32.74 to 212.78, n = 98). </P>
<P>Patients receiving hawthorn extract had an improvement in symptoms such as dyspnoea and fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-Leuchtgens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leuchtgens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_HD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (HD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_LD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (LD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iwamoto-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Iwamoto 1981</LINK>). The symptom score developed by von Zerssen (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Zerssen-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Zerssen 1971</LINK>) was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leuchtgens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leuchtgens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_HD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (HD)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_LD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (LD)</LINK>). Data from these two studies suggest a significant differential effect in favour of hawthorn extract (WMD -5.47, 95% CI -8.68 to -2.26, n = 239).</P>
<P>Two single trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichst_x00e4_dt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eichstädt 2001</LINK>) reported analysable data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and 6-min walk test. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eichst_x00e4_dt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eichstädt 2001</LINK>) found significant inter-group difference in LVEF% (WMD (%) 1.70, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.52, n = 40). However, LVEF% correlates only weakly with exercise tolerance and is often regarded as a surrogate outcome measure. Clinical outcomes were not available. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 2004</LINK>) found no significant difference in 6-min walk test between the two groups (WMD (min) -8.00, 95% CI -34.49 to 18.49, n = 113). </P>
<P>We also specifically looked for data on mortality and morbidity such as cardiac events, but only one trial reported deaths (three in active group versus one in control) without further details. The most common adverse event was dizziness/vertigo (n = 8) and gastrointestinal complaints (n = 5) (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for further details of reported adverse events). Five trials reported no adverse events in patients receiving hawthorn extract.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Our results suggest that, compared with placebo, hawthorn extract increases the maximal workload in patients with chronic heart failure. This conclusion, however, is based on small numbers of studies and patients. Nevertheless, the secondary outcome measures support the findings and suggest that hawthorn extract is superior to placebo as an adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic heart failure. </P>
<P>As described in the characteristics of included studies table, in seven trials most patients were also treated with conventional medications, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. In the other trials, it was not clear whether patients received other medications. Thus, there is a degree of uncertainty whether the benefit can be ascribed to hawthorn extract alone. Many effective and established conventional treatments are available for chronic heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC 2001</LINK>). Weight control, dietary measures, smoking cessation,and pharmacological interventions are generally regarded as first-line treatment approaches for most patients (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dargie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Millane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millane 2000</LINK>). Diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-Faris-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faris 2006</LINK>) and digitalis (<LINK REF="REF-Hood-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hood 2004</LINK>) lead to an improvement of heart failure-related symptoms, whereas beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors also improve survival (<LINK REF="REF-Doughty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lonn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuyuki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuyuki 2000</LINK>). ACE inhibitors have been reported to increase parameters of physical performance, such as exercise tolerance, by approximately 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Kiowski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiowski 1996</LINK>). A meta-analysis of ACE inhibitors reported an average improvement of exercise duration by 19% in the treatment group, compared with 7% in the placebo group (<LINK REF="REF-Narang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narang 1996</LINK>). The results of our meta-analysis suggest an improvement of maximal workload of about 9% above placebo. In a direct comparison of 900 mg of hawthorn extract (LI 132) daily with 37.5 mg of captopril daily in 132 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 1994</LINK>), both groups increased their maximal workload significantly, without differences between the two treatments. Thus, these data suggest that hawthorn improves physical performance measures to a smaller yet clinically meaningful degree compared with ACE inhibitors. </P>
<P>Changes in physical performance due to drug effects do not correlate well with changes in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Swedberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swedberg 1994</LINK>), but currently there are no rigorous trials that have assessed important long-term clinical outcomes such as cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalisation. One such large-scale study was recently completed (personal contact), which compares 900 mg of standardised hawthorn extract WS 1442 with placebo during a 24-month treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Holubarsch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holubarsch 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>It has been suggested that hawthorn extract has positive inotropic effects, decreases atrioventricular conduction time, and increases coronary blood flow. These effects seem similar to those of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as amrinone and milrinone. Hawthorn extract, however, increases the refractory period (<LINK REF="REF-Joseph-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 1995</LINK>), which may explain why it seems to be associated with antiarrhythmic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loew-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loew 1997</LINK>), whereas phosphodiesterase inhibitors and most other inotropic agents have proarrhythmic effects. Hawthorn extract blocks repolarising potassium currents in ventricular myocytes, an effect that is similar to the action of class III antiarrhythmic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 1999</LINK>). In addition, the positive inotropic effect is similar to the action of cardiac glycosides (<LINK REF="REF-Schwinger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwinger 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Whether or not hawthorn, like phosphodiesterase inhibitors, has adverse effects on the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure is not known, but may be answered by the ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Holubarsch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holubarsch 2000</LINK>). The pharmacologic profile of hawthorn is similar to digoxin (<LINK REF="REF-Joseph-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 1995</LINK>). Because of a relatively small therapeutic window, digoxin is associated with a risk of intoxication, particularly in elderly patients and those with impaired renal function (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kernan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernan 1994</LINK>). In contrast, patients with NYHA class III were treated with 1800 mg of hawthorn extract daily for 16 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Tauchert-2002-_x0028_HD_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tauchert 2002 (HD)</LINK>), an increase of 100% over the standard dose. Patients reported only mild and infrequent adverse events which were not different from those reported by patients taking 900 mg of hawthorn extract and fewer than with placebo. These were (cases) dizziness/vertigo (4), bronchitis (4), back pain (5), flu-like syndrome (4), headache (2), arthritis (1), flatulence (1) and gastroenteritis (1).</P>
<P>Postmarketing surveillance studies report only mild and infrequent adverse events in patients receiving hawthorn extract. In a study of 1011 patients, 14 adverse events (1.4%) occurred after the administration of 900 mg of hawthorn extract for 24 weeks. In 2 of these patients, a causal relation with hawthorn was suspected, but regarded by the treating doctors as unlikely (<LINK REF="REF-Tauchert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tauchert 1999</LINK>). In another postmarketing surveillance study of 3664 patients who were treated with 900 mg of hawthorn extract for 8 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1998</LINK>), 48 patients (1.3%) reported adverse events, including hot flushes, stomach complaints, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnoea, headache, and epistaxis. In 19 patients, this resulted in the discontinuation of the treatment. Although these data suggest that hawthorn extract is relatively safe, self-medication is inappropriate among patients with heart failure, who should be treated by a licensed clinician. Self-medication might also increase the risk of adverse events through herb-drug interactions (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>). Based primarily on animal experiments, hawthorn extracts may interact with anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and cardiac glycosides (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herr 2002</LINK>). In a preliminary report presented in abstract form, there was no interaction between hawthorn extract and digoxin in healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Tankanow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tankanow 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, we believe that hawthorn extracts are not ideal candidates for the over-the-counter market. </P>
<P>Limitations of our systematic review and indeed systematic reviews in general, pertain to the potential incompleteness of the reviewed evidence. We aimed to identify all RCTs on the topic. However, only a few studies provided data on our primary outcome variable. The distorting effects on systematic reviews arising from publication bias and location bias are well-documented (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Easterbrook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easterbrook 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>). This includes suggestions that positive findings may be overrepresented in complementary medicine journals (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>) and that these journals favour positive conclusions at the expense of methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2000</LINK>). In addition, there is evidence that positive findings tend to be published in English-language journals (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), whereas some European journals are not indexed in major medical databases (<LINK REF="REF-Nieminen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieminen 1999</LINK>). Thus, treatment effects may be exaggerated, especially for herbal medicinal products because much of the evidence originates from European countries. We did not restrict our searches by publication language, and are therefore confident that our strategy minimised bias. We only included data from clinical trials that were randomised, double-blind, and placebo controlled. Nevertheless, the extent of methodological rigour varied among trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The best evidence that is available suggests that hawthorn extract has significant benefits, compared with placebo, as an adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic heart failure. Reported adverse events were infrequent, mild, and transient.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Whether hawthorn extract affects the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure requires further investigation. Future trials should report clinical as well as physiological outcomes.</P>
