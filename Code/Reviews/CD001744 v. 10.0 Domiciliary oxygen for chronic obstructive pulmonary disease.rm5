<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Some people with chronic lung disease (COPD - chronic bronchitis or emphysema) have low levels of oxygen in their blood. Oxygen levels might be low all the time, or only at night when breathing slows during sleep. Some people use bottled oxygen through the night at home, to try and improve their breathing. The review of trials found that when people with COPD and low levels of blood oxygen did this for the long term, their survival rates improved. However, it did not lengthen survival of people whose oxygen levels were only moderately low, or only low at night.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-23 12:20:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Domiciliary oxygen therapy has become one of the major forms of treatment for hypoxaemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of domiciliary oxygen therapy on survival and quality of life in patients with COPD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD register using the search terms: home OR domiciliary AND oxygen. Searches were current as of January 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Any RCT in patients with hypoxaemia and COPD that compared long term domiciliary or home oxygen therapy with a control treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 12:20:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Six randomised controlled trials were identified. Survival data were aggregated from two trials of the treatment of nocturnal oxygen therapy in patients with mild to moderate COPD and arterial desaturation at night. Survival data was also aggregated from two trials of continuous oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in mild to moderate COPD. Data could not be aggregated for the other two trials because of differences in trial design and patient selection. Nott 1980: continuous oxygen therapy versus nocturnal oxygen therapy: there was a significant improvement in mortality after 24 months (Peto odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.81). MRC 1981: domiciliary oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy: there was a significant improvement over five years in mortality in the group receiving oxygen therapy (Peto odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.98). In the two studies of nocturnal oxygen versus no oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and arterial desaturation at night: there was no difference in mortality between treated and non treated groups for either trial or when the trials were aggregated. In the two trials of long-term oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in COPD patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia: there was no effect on survival for up to three years of follow up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Long-term home oxygen therapy improved survival in a selected group of COPD patients with severe hypoxaemia (arterial PaO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 55 mm Hg (8.0 kPa)). Home oxygen therapy did not appear to improve survival in patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia or in those with only arterial desaturation at night.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 12:26:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>
<B>Continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy in hypoxaemic chronic obstructive lung disease</B> (<LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK>)</P>
<P>A total of 1,043 patients from six centres were screened for inclusion in the NOTT study. Eight hundred and nine patients were excluded for a variety of reasons including other major concomitant disease, refusal to participate, patients who had received previous oxygen therapy or patients with a PaO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 59 mm Hg (7.9 kPa). The study was not blinded.</P>
<P>Two hundred and three patients with hypoxaemic chronic obstructive lung disease were randomly allocated to either nocturnal oxygen therapy (n=102) or continuous oxygen therapy (n=101) at an oxygen flow-rate of 1 to 4 litres per minute. The oxygen source was an oxygen concentrator, liquid oxygen or compressed gas. The mean age was 65.7 years in the nocturnal oxygen therapy group and 65.2 years in the continuous oxygen therapy group. Most patients were male, 80.4% in the nocturnal oxygen therapy group and 77.2% in the continuous oxygen therapy group.</P>
<P>After 12 months of oxygen therapy there was no difference in mortality between the treated and control groups of patients (Peto Odds Ratio: 0.53; 95% CI; 0.25, 1.11). After 24 months of oxygen therapy, there was a significant improvement in mortality (Peto Odds Ratio: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.81) for the continuous oxygen therapy group.</P>
<P>In this RCT, quality of life parameters and some physiological variables were studied, but the number of patients in each group was not defined and only baseline data was reported. However, in the Timms's report of the <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study, rates of change of physiological variables were reported after six months of oxygen treatment. The authors reported nocturnal oxygen therapy was associated with significant decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance during exercise. They also reported that continuous oxygen therapy was associated with larger decreases in resting and exercise pulmonary vascular resistance and significant improvements in the exercise response of mean pulmonary artery pressure and stroke index.</P>
<P>Weighted Mean Differences with 95% CI demonstrated no significant differences in the change from baseline, for continuous and nocturnal groups of patients, for the physiological parameters; right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume index and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, the continuous oxygen therapy group demonstrated a significant increase in right ventricular stroke work index over the nocturnal group in response to exercise: (WMD: 6.20, 95%CI; 0.52, 11.88).</P>
<P>The study speculated that those patients most likely to benefit from continuous oxygen therapy would have relatively severely impaired quality of life and brain disfunction but relatively mild disturbances of pulmonary haemodynamics and exercise capacity.</P>
<P>
<B>Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy in chronic hypoxic cor pulmonale complicating chronic bronchitis and emphysema </B>(<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK>)</P>
<P>This controlled trial of LTOT took place in three centres in the United Kingdom. Eighty seven patients with a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, were randomised to receive oxygen therapy (treatment group) or no oxygen (controls). The study was not blinded. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had a PaO<SUB>2</SUB> of between 40 and 60 mm Hg (5.3 and 8 kPa) and one or more recorded episodes of heart failure with ankle oedema, and so were highly selected. The treatment group, 33 men and 9 women, received oxygen therapy for at least 15 hours a day at a flow-rate of a minimum of 2 litres per minute. Eight patients in the treatment group received liquid oxygen therapy and all but one of the patients (total number not disclosed) from one centre received oxygen via an oxygen concentrator. The remaining subjects received cylinder oxygen. A total of 33 men and 12 women were included in the control group.</P>
<P>Mean (range) age was 58.2 (44-69) years for the male treatment group, 56.2 (42-68) years for the male control group, 59.4 (55-67) years for the female treatment group and 59.3 (50-69) years for the female controls. Mean baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was 0.76 litres and 0.58 litres for the treatment male and female groups respectively and 0.65 litres and 0.63 litres for the control male and female groups. Mean baseline FVC was 1.92 litres and 1.31 litres for the treatment male and female groups respectively and 1.88 litres and 1.46 litres for the control male and female groups. Mean baseline PaO<SUB>2</SUB> was 50.4 mm Hg (6.7 kPa) and 49.4 mm Hg (6.6 kPa) for the treatment male and female groups respectively and 51.5 mm Hg (6.9 kPa) and 51.8 mm Hg (6.9 kPa) for the control male and female groups.</P>
<P>There was an improvement in mortality over five years in the group receiving oxygen therapy (Peto Odds Ratio 0.42, 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.98). However, there was no difference in mortality for male patients in both treated and control groups up to 500 days from commencement of treatment. In female patients, mortality was improved for the oxygen-treated group from the commencement of treatment. However, the number of female patients in each of the treated and control groups was small (n=9 and n=12).</P>
<P>Rates of change of physiological variables were reported for patients dying between 180 and 500 days and for those surviving over 500 days. Patient numbers in some subgroups were small (n&lt;10) and only small changes were observed. Long-term survivors in the control group increased their PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> to a greater extent than the oxygen therapy group (WMD: -2.16, 95%CI; -4.04, -0.28). The control group long-term survivors also had a greater rate of decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (WMD: 0.08, 95%CI; 0.04, 0.12) than the oxygen treated group. The study found that the male subjects most likely to benefit from oxygen therapy had a sum of the red cell mass and PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 98.</P>

<B>A double-blind trial of nocturnal supplemental oxygen for sleep desaturation in patients with COPD and a daytime PaO<SUB>2</SUB> above 60 mm Hg.</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1992</LINK>)</P>
<P>Thirty eight patients with COPD and nocturnal sleep desaturation agreed to participate in this double-blind RCT. A further 13 patients with similar baseline pulmonary function who did not desaturate were also followed up but not randomised. The subjects were randomised to receive either nocturnal oxygen therapy (n=19) or sham treatment (n=19). In the control group, 6 patients died and there were 4 dropouts (2 withdrew, 1 developed daytime hypoxaemia, 1 was noncompliant). Of the original 19 treated subjects, 6 developed significant daytime hypoxaemia, 1 developed worsening of sleep apnea and there were 5 deaths.</P>
<P>Oxygen was supplied to the active treatment group by an oxygen concentrator. The control group received gas from an oxygen concentrator rendered ineffective. However, some control group patients received an oxygen concentration of 25% rather than the ambient concentration of 21%, equivalent to an inspired oxygen tension of approximately 30 mm Hg (4 kPa) greater than if they had received room air. Mean age in the control group was 61.2 years and mean age in the oxygen treated group was 62.1 years. The gender of the subjects was not given. The sham treated group and oxygen treated group used their concentrators for a mean of 9.4 ± 0.9 and 7.6 ± 0.7 hours per night, respectively .</P>
<P>Physiological variables were reported for the survivors at baseline and at 36 months. The authors found no significant effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy on any of the sleep parameters studied.</P>
<P>There was no difference in mortality after 36 months between the oxygen treated and sham treated groups. However, the possibility of a Type-2 error occurring could not be rejected due to the small study size although the point estimate of mortality was very close to the odds ratio of 1.0.</P>
<P>
<B>Effect of long-term oxygen therapy on survival in patients with COPD with moderate hypoxaemia </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK>)</P>
<P>One hundred and thirty five patients with COPD and moderate hypoxaemia referred to nine regional centres in Poland were included in this unblinded RCT. Patients with concomitant disease that might impact on survival were excluded from the study.</P>
<P>Sixty seven patients, 52 males 15 females, mean age 62.4 years formed the control group and 68 patients, 51 males 17 females, mean age 60.1 years, formed the treatment group. Both treated and control groups received "usual treatment" which consisted of bronchodilators, antibiotics, corticosteroids and diuretics as required. The oxygen group received oxygen from an oxygen concentrator at a flow-rate that raised resting PaO<SUB>2</SUB> to greater than 65 mm Hg (8.7 kPa) . The patients were followed for three years or until death.</P>
<P>No difference in mortality during the study period was found between COPD patients with moderate hypoxaemia with conventional treatment plus LTOT versus conventional treatment only. In the intervention group, the duration of oxygen therapy (prescribed over 15 hours per day, used 13.5 ± 4.4 hours per day) did not affect survival.</P>
<P>Physiological parameters could not be assessed as they were not reported by treatment group.</P>
<P>
<B>A randomised trial of nocturnal oxygen therapy in COPD patients</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Chaouat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaouat 1999</LINK>)</P>
<P>Seventy six patients with COPD and mild to moderate daytime hypoxaemia exhibiting significant nocturnal desaturation were randomised into this unblinded study. The patients were recruited from six hospital outpatient clinics of four Europeans countries.</P>
<P>Thirty five patients, mean age 64 ± 6 years, gender not defined, formed the control group and 41 patients, mean age 63 ± 8 years the treatment group. Patients were excluded if they had a variety of co morbidities including left heart or congenital heart disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, lung carcinoma or other severe disease that could influence survival. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea were also excluded. Patients in the treatment group were given concentrator oxygen for eight to ten hours per night at a flow rate usually of 2 litres per minute (mean use 8.9 ± 1.9 hours per day). The control group received no oxygen therapy. Data was analysed on an intention to treat basis due to some patients in both treatment and control groups requiring conventional LTOT of at least eighteen hours per day during the follow-up period.</P>
<P>There was no difference in mortality between the treated and control groups on an intention to treat basis.</P>
<P>Twelve patients in the nocturnal oxygen group and 10 control group patients deteriorated and required treatment with conventional LTOT during the follow-up period of from 2.5 to 60 months. Five of these patients subsequently died, two in the treated group and three in the control group. Nocturnal oxygen did not allow the prescription of LTOT to be delayed.</P>
<P>Rates of change of pulmonary haemodynamics parameters were not reported and so were not assessed in this meta-analysis. However, the authors reported no significant difference between treated and control groups in the evolution of any of these parameters over a two year period.</P>
<P>
<B>Long-term oxygen therapy stops the natural decline of endurance in COPD patients with reversible hypercapnia </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty eight inpatients (26 males), aged 49-74 years, admitted to a German hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD, mild hypoxaemia (PaO<SUB>2</SUB> 66.5 ± 6.3 mm Hg) and moderate reversible hypercapnia during exercise were randomised to LTOT or to a control group. The control group received no oxygen therapy. The study was unblinded. Patients with malignant disease, left heart failure or other significant comorbidity were excluded from the study. Patients were followed up for three years.</P>
<P>The treatment group was prescribed oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 2 litres per minute for a minimum of 15 hours per day. However, patients used their concentrator a mean of 10.4 ± 4.2 hours per day.</P>
<P>A total of 14 patients were randomised to each study group. Physiological measurements were reported at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up. Mortality was reported after three years of follow-up. Mortality data was analysed on an intention to treat basis due to five patients in the control group requiring LTOT during the follow-up period.</P>
<P>The authors found a small but significant difference in endurance time between the LTOT and control groups after one year of treatment. Exercise endurance time was reported to be significantly reduced for the control group at one year but maintained for the treated group. Other physiological parameters FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, inspiratory vital capacity, PaO<SUB>2</SUB> and residual volume/total lung capacity did not change with treatment. The authors also reported a significant increase in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> after one year of follow-up for the control group which was not observed in the treatment group.</P>
<P>End-exercise dyspnoea score was found to be significantly greater for the control group after one year of follow-up. Standard deviations of the mean change in measurements between baseline and one year were not reported and so mean change from baseline could not be assessed. After one year of treatment, the 95% CI for the WMD between treated and control groups for both dyspnoea and exercise endurance time overlapped the no-difference line (WMD (dyspnoea): -1.2, 95% CI; -2.47, 0.07, WMD (endurance time): 2.2, 95%CI; -0.73, 5.13). However, the study was limited by the small number of patients randomised and wide standard deviations of the variables studied.</P>
<P>Four patients in the LTOT group and 3 in the control group died during the three year follow up period.</P>
<P>
<B>Data aggregation in relation to mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Aggregating the Chaouat 1999 and Fletcher 1992 studies, a weighting of 61.3% was applied to the Chaouat 1999 study and 38.7% to the Fletcher 1992 study. There was no difference in mortality between the treated and control groups. The pooled Peto Odds Ratio moved closer to unity, (pooled Peto Odds Ratio: 0.97, 95% CI; 0.41, 2.31) than the individual Odds Ratios.</P>
<P>Aggregating the data for the two studies of LTOT versus no oxygen therapy for patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia (Gorecka 1997, Haidl 2004), a weighting of 86.2% was applied to the Gorecka study and 13.8% to the Haidl study. There was no significant difference in mortality between the treated and control groups (pooled Peto Odds Ratio: 1.39, 95% CI; 0.74, 2.59).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK>) involved the treatment of subjects with COPD with LTOT compared with no oxygen therapy. However, the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study was not combined with the other two studies as subjects with severe hypoxaemia (PaO<SUB>2 </SUB>5.3-8.0 kPa, 40-60 mm Hg) were included in this study while the <LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK> studies included subjects with mild to moderate hypoxaemia (PaO<SUB>2</SUB> 56-65 mm Hg or &gt;55 mm Hg). Although the three studies included a small number of female subjects, survival was only stratified by gender for the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study.</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two of the six RCTs included in this meta-analysis demonstrated a significant survival advantage for the selected COPD subjects receiving LTOT. In the <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study there was a significant improvement in mortality for hypoxaemic COPD patients after 24 months of treatment with continuous LTOT over the nocturnal oxygen therapy group. In the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study LTOT produced a small but significant overall improvement in survival in both male and female patients with severe hypoxic cor pulmonale complicating chronic bronchitis and emphysema. However, the authors reported a different survival response between males and females. Survival for treated and control male patients was similar until 500 days from the commencement of treatment ("Survivor effect"). However, the mortality of the control female patients was reported to be significantly greater than that of the treated females from the commencement of home oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>A numbers needed to treat (NNT) estimate (1/absolute relative risk) of 4.5 can be calculated for the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study where the risk of death in the control group is 0.67, the relative risk for the oxygen treated group is 0.45, and the absolute risk reduction is 0.22. Thus, for the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study, treating five patients with severe hypoxaemic COPD with long-term oxygen therapy saved one life over the five year study period. </P>
<P>We found no evidence to suggest that nocturnal supplemental oxygen for COPD patients with nocturnal sleep desaturation but mild to moderate daytime hypoxaemia improved mortality. </P>
<P>Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy for COPD patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK>) did not prolong survival. However, in both of these studies, patients were using a mean of 13.5 hours or less per day of oxygen therapy. </P>
<P>The relatively small numbers of patients, the young age of participants and the lack of co morbidities in most of the above studies raises concerns about the applicability of the survival outcomes to current clinical situations. Patients with COPD fulfilling prescription guidelines for domiciliary home oxygen therapy appear to be older than the subjects included in these studies. The majority of these COPD patients have multiple co morbidities. The assumption that home oxygen therapy has a beneficial effect in these patients has not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life issues and physiological parameters<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK> study reported that LTOT reduced exertional dyspnoea in COPD patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemia in association with an increase in endurance time. However, the number of patients included in the study was small, the standard deviations were wide and the weighted mean difference for both dyspnoea and endurance time included the no-difference line. Dyspnoea was not reported in the other controlled trials. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study reported that indicators such as general improvement in the sense of well-being, improved appetite, and general alertness were frequently found in those patients treated with oxygen therapy. However, no data was given. The <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study reported neuropsychological deficits in hypoxic COPD patients groups and observed small improvements in neuropsychologic function and quality of life when data from all patients was combined.</P>
<P>Other health outcome variables e.g. physiological parameters were analysed in the meta-analysis as mean change scores where these were reported, due to small differences in baseline mean values between treated and control groups. Any changes in physiological parameters in response to oxygen therapy were very small. However, all significant changes favoured the oxygen treated groups. The long-term survivors in the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study in the control group had a greater rise in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> than the oxygen treated group. Greater progression of hypercapnia was also reported for the control group in the <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK> study. However, this effect was not observed in the <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1992</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Chaouat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaouat 1999</LINK> studies.</P>
<P>Physiological variables should be considered intermediate outcomes of oxygen therapy treatment while survival and quality of life should be considered as the more definitive outcomes. It is possible that statistically significant improvement in some physiological variables had little measurable impact on the subjects' perceived quality of life or survival. </P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of the studies<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>This systematic review has highlighted several problems with the patient selection and study design. Only one of the studies was double-blinded due to the inability to blind liquid oxygen therapy. Thus all trials were included in this review. The treatment regime for the control groups of the studies varied from none for the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chaouat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaouat 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK> trials, nocturnal oxygen therapy for the <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study to sham treatment through a disabled oxygen concentrator equivalent to 25% oxygen therapy in the <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1992</LINK> study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1992</LINK> study this level of oxygen therapy for the control subjects may have confounded the results as this higher oxygen tension may have been reflected in the PaO<SUB>2</SUB> for this group. </P>
<P>The cross over during follow-up of patients in both the nocturnal oxygen and control groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Chaouat-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaouat 1999</LINK> study and control group in the <LINK REF="STD-Haidl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haidl 2004</LINK> study may have influenced their survival. <BR/> <BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study, the numbers of patients receiving the different modes of oxygen therapy treatment were not given. In the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study, there were some differences between treated and control groups at baseline. Females in the treated group appeared to have more compromised lung function than those of the control group while the reverse appeared to be apparent for the male patient groups. The mean number of hospitalisations and hospitalised days in the <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1992</LINK> study could not be included in this review as standard deviations were not given. The <LINK REF="STD-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorecka 1997</LINK> study reported differences in studied variables by survivors and non survivors. </P>
<P>No data was reported in the two major studies (<LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK>) about the effects of continued or cessation of smoking or indeed if smoking status affected the outcomes. The mean PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> tension at baseline was higher in the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1981" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1981</LINK> study than in the <LINK REF="STD-NOTT-1980" TYPE="STUDY">NOTT 1980</LINK> study. This did not appear to influence the results. Other known prognostic indicators such as body mass index were not discussed in either of the studies. The lack of exacerbation data is also a further limiting factor in interpreting the results.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Long term oxygen therapy improved survival in a selected group of COPD patients with severe hypoxaemia. Long term oxygen therapy did not appear to improve survival in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxaemia nor in COPD patients with nocturnal desaturation but resting daytime oxygenation above that to qualify for oxygen therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The role of long-term oxygen therapy in COPD with moderate hypoxaemia and or nocturnal desaturation requires further investigation with larger numbers of participants included in the studies.</P>
<P>Ethical concerns have been raised about the randomisation of patients to placebo and this may be a bar to obtaining more appropriate health status data about the effects of oxygen in more severely hypoxaemic subjects.</P>
