<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-02 12:28:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The abuse of opioid drugs and drug dependency are major health and social issues. Maintenance treatments with pharmacological agents can help to reduce the risks associated with the use of street drugs for drug addicts who are unable to abstain from drug use. Methadone is effective in retaining patients in treatment and reducing heroin use but re-addiction remains as a substantial challenge. Opiate addicts often have psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depression and may not be able to cope with stress. Psychosocial interventions including psychiatric care, psychotherapy, counselling, and social work services are commonly offered as part of the maintenance programs. Psychological support varies from structured psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and supportive-expressive therapy to behavioural interventions and contingency management.<BR/>This review addressed whether a specific psychosocial intervention provides any additional benefit to pharmacological maintenance treatment. The control intervention was a maintenance program, which routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to pharmacological treatment. Present evidence suggests that adding psychosocial support does not change the effectiveness of retention in treatment and opiate use during treatment. Findings on retention in treatment were for 12 different psychosocial interventions including contingency management. These conclusions are based on 34 randomised trials involving 3777 opiate addicts, some 73% of whom were male. All but three studies were conducted in the USA.<BR/>The previous version of this review showed a reduction in opiate use during treatment that was no longer the case with the addition of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abstinent at the end of follow up. The psychosocial interventions are likely to require rigorous assessment of any changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning that may indirectly reduce drug use over longer periods of time.<BR/>

<P>35 studies, 4319 participants, were included. These studies considered thirteen different psychosocial interventions. Comparing any psychosocial plus any maintenance pharmacological treatment to standard maintenance treatment, results do not show benefit for retention in treatment, 27 studies, 3124 participants, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), abstinence by opiate during the treatment, 8 studies, 1002 participants, RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.37), compliance, three studies, MD 0.43 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.92), psychiatric symptoms, 3 studies, MD 0.02 (-0.28 to 0.31), depression, 3 studies, MD -1.70 (95% CI -3.91 to 0.51) and results at the end of follow up as number of participants still in treatment, 3 studies, 250 participants, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) and participants abstinent by opioid, 3 studies, 181 participants, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.36). Comparing the different psychosocial approaches, results are never statistically significant for all the comparisons and outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-02 12:21:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-01 12:58:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 10:28:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Substance dependence continues to be a major clinical and social problem affecting millions of people worldwide and causing substantial costs to society.<BR/>Drug dependence has been described by the World Health Organization as "a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena of variable intensity, in which the use of a psychoactive drug (or drugs) takes on a high priority. The necessary descriptive characteristics are preoccupation with a desire to obtain and take the drug and persistent drug-seeking behaviour. Determinants and the problematic consequences of drug dependence may be biological, physiological or social, and usually interact." (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Abuse and dependence on opioid drugs are major health and social issues in most societies.The UNODC estimates the total number of opiates users at the global level between 15.2-21.1 million people (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2007</LINK>). More than half of the world&#8217;s opiates using population are thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the population aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes out of Afghanistan.</P>
<P>Trends in use appear to indicate a stabilisation of the overall number of heroin users in Europe, but recent data on drug induced deaths are mostly associated with opioid use (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2009</LINK>). The largest heroin using population in the Americas is found in the USA where approximately 1.2 million heroin users (0.6% of the population aged 15-64) have been estimated (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 10:28:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Data from literature and clinical experience, suggest that methadone treatment aimed at maintenance is effective. Maintenance treatments, for those who are not yet able to achieve a drug free state, may help to reduce the risks associated with the use of street drugs.<BR/>Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse in heroin use, and relapse from the drug-free state to re-addiction is a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of dependent heroin users.</P>
<P>The difficulty for drug addicts in maintaining a drug-free state makes the psychological process underlying addiction particularly important in developing treatments and their importance is becoming increasingly apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philips 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The continued use of illicit substance reflects the drug addict's continuing inability to cope with stress. In this category of patients, the process of affective states elaboration is often delegated to an external factor such as a substance mood modifier. The substance abuse is reinforced by the positive expectancies towards the drug's effectiveness in reducing the stress due to the deficiencies in coping with situational demands (<LINK REF="REF-Castellani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castellani 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-01 12:57:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol has conducted six reviews on maintenance treatment of opioid dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick_x002c_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick, 2009</LINK>). These reviews highlight that methadone maintenance at proper doses is the most effective treatment in retaining patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use but shows weak evidence of effectiveness towards other relevant outcomes such as mortality, criminal activity and quality of life. However, perhaps the only component of methadone maintenance treatment that has been conclusively evaluated is the dose level of the medication itself (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>). While the dose of methadone is clearly an "active ingredient" in methadone maintenance treatment, questions remain regarding the efficacy and value of the support services such as psychiatric care, psychotherapies, drug abuse counselling, urine monitoring, and social work services that are commonly offered by most maintenance programs and by all other forms of substance abuse treatment.</P>
<P>Psychosocial treatments for opioid dependence are a critical component of the overall treatment package and require evaluation as stand-alone interventions but also in combination with pharmacotherapies. This current review focuses on psychosocial treatments delivered in association with pharmacological maintenance treatment, to determine if the psychosocial treatments are effective in influencing adherence to treatment and in reducing relapse rates. In parallel with this review, there are two other partner reviews. The first looks at the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions plus pharmacological interventions for opioid detoxification (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2011</LINK>). The second looks at the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions alone for opiate dependence and abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Mayet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayet 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of the population with substance use disorders, and the wide range of different psychosocial interventions, makes it very difficult to identify a particular therapeutic intervention as the gold-standard in this area. Hence this review will be comprehensive in the list of interventions which will be considered with the aim of including every type of psychosocial intervention provided to patients in conjunction with agonist maintenance treatment. No a priori choice will be made, since the scope of the review is to explore if psychosocial treatments contribute to the achievements of the expected outcomes, rather than ranking the different treatments. Should one of the treatments considered appear to prevail, it will be separately reviewed.</P>

<B>Control intervention: </B>Any agonist treatments alone for opiate maintenance therapy.<BR/>It was intended to consider outcomes for participants using multiple drugs separately because these people may respond differently to psychosocial interventions than those with less severe problems. However, insufficient information of this nature was available to make this comparison.<BR/>Psychosocial treatments in combination with antagonist maintenance (e.g. naltrexone) treatment is not included in this review. The aims and context of antagonist maintenance are in quite different to agonist maintenance therapy and it would be complex dealing with this diversity as well as the diversity in psychosocial interventions.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-02 10:06:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The risk of bias assessment for RCTs were performed using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Review is a two-part tool, addressing seven specific domains, namely sequence generation and allocation concealment selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias) blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias) , incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) selective outcome reporting (reporting bias) and other source of bias. The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgments we will use the criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to  the addiction field. <I>See</I> <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation and  allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) were addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants and, personnel (avoidance of performance bias) were not assessed because it was not feasible for the kind of intervention. Blinding of outcome assessor (avoidance of detection bias) were considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. retention, abstinence measured by urine-analysis, subjects still in treatment or abstinent at the end of follow up) and subjective outcomes (e.g. side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were considered for all outcomes except for the drop out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for criteria used to assess risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Grading of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was assessed according to GRADE method (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>), a method systematic and explicit. In order to indicate the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct, judgments about the quality of evidence are made for each comparison and outcome. These judgments consider study design (RCT, quasi RCT or observational study), study quality (detailed study design and execution), consistency of results (similarity of estimates of effect across studies), precision of estimates, and directness (the extent to which people, interventions and outcome measures are similar to those of interest). The following definitions in grading the quality of evidence for each outcome are used: High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:35:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Dichotomous outcomes (retention, abstinence by primary substance, results at follow-up) have been analysed calculating the Relative risk (RR) for each trial with the uncertainty in each result being expressed by their confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Continuous outcomes (compliance, psychiatric symptoms, depression) have been analysed calculating the Mean Difference (MD) with 95%CI. Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated comparing and pooled the mean score differences from the end of treatment to baseline for each group. In case of missing data about the standard deviation of the change we imputed this measure using the standard deviation at the end of treatment for each group.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-08-01 10:58:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>We have not used data presented as number of positive urine tests over total number of tests in the experimental and control group as measure of  substance abuse.  This is because using tests instead of the participants as the unit of analysis violates the hypothesis of independence among observations. In fact, the results of tests done in each participant are not independent.</P>
<P>If all arms in a multi-arm trial are to be included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm is to be included in more than one of the treatment comparisons, then we divided the number of events and the number of participants in that arm by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method avoid the multiple use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial. It compromises the precision of the pooled estimate slightly.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:00:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Statistically significant heterogeneity among primary outcome studies was assessed with Chi-squared (Q) test and I-squared (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>The results were summarized, with comparisons of quantitative data where possible, first comparing the presence of any kind of psychosocial versus pharmacological and then separately for the type of psychosocial treatment.</P>
<P>Eight studies had more than two arms of comparison, in this case we matched the groups with the same psychosocial intervention and the control groups if there was no psychosocial treatment. This was possible for seven out of eight studies. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Woody-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Woody 1983</LINK>) in the first arm, participants were treated with a behavioural treatment, in the second arm with a psychoanalytic oriented treatment and in the third with a standard methadone maintenance treatment. This study was included for the first arm in the group of behavioural treatments and for the second arm in the group of psychoanalytic oriented treatment, participants of the third arm are considered twice; in any case these comparisons are kept separate preventing these participants from being counted twice. For details on the studies <I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables</P>
<P>For some outcomes reported in the included studies, it was impossible to make comparisons and pool results due the criteria adopted for reporting the results. Different rating instruments were used and for many of them the authors did not indicate the range of scores that were considered to represent mild, moderate and severe. This prevented comparison of results between studies. In addition, the results on urinalysis could not be summarised because these data were incongruous and the number of positive cases was unclear and possibly biased since the results are mainly based on number of positive tests rather than number of participants with positive tests.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Czuchry-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Czuchry 2009</LINK>) couldn't be included in any meta-analysis because the number of participants allocated to each group was not reported</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-02 09:15:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Thirty five studies, 4319 participants, were included. These studies considered twelve different psychosocial interventions and three pharmacological maintenance treatments: Methadone, Buprenorphine, LAAM.</P>
<P>Comparing any psychosocial plus any maintenance pharmacological treatment to standard maintenance treatment, results do not show benefit for retention in treatment, 26 studies, 2582 participants, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), abstinence by opiate during the treatment, 8 studies, 1002 participants, RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.37), compliance, measured as number of psychological sessions attended, three studies, MD 0.43 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.92), psychiatric symptoms, measured by differences (post-pre treatment) in rating of Symptom Check List -90 scale, 3 studies, MD 0.02 (-0.28 to 0.31), depression, measured by differences (post-pre treatment) in rating of Beck Depression Inventory, 3 studies, MD -1.70 (95% CI -3.91 to 0.51) and results at the end of follow up as number of participants still in treatment, 3 studies, 250 participants, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) and participants abstinent by opioid, 3 studies, 181 participants, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.36). The remaining outcomes were analysed only in single studies considering a limited number of participants.</P>
<P>Comparing the different psychosocial approaches, results are never statistically significant for all the comparisons and outcomes and this is true also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. In fact results on retention in treatment for the 14 studies, 1616 participants, that considered contingency management approaches do not show any additional benefit in adding this intervention: RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.96 to1.08).</P>
<P>Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality.</P>
<P>The previous versions of this review showed a reduction in opiate use during treatment that was no longer the case with the addition of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abstinent at the end of follow up.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-06-25 13:58:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in this review is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to pharmacological therapy; thus the present review did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when pharmacological maintenance treatment is provided but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support.</P>
<P>These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.</P>
<P>It is also worth mentioning that, like other patients who have been treated with some kind of psychotherapy, opiate addicts have significant psychiatric problems especially in the areas of depression and anxiety. To the extent that drug use is an attempt to self-medicate for these problems and to the degree that psychosocial intervention, especially psychotherapy, can reduce them, psychotherapy can, perhaps, reduce drug use indirectly in these people. Nevertheless to evaluate these effects it is necessary to observe these patients for long periods and to develop methods for standard assessments of specific outcomes.</P>
<P>Regarding the applicability it is probably good but it is important to note that 26/28 studies were conducted in the USA and this is a limit to the generalisability of the results because health effects of various substances of abuse seem to be strongly dependent on social context, and the location of the conduct of the studies could act as an effect modifier in the estimation of efficacy of treatment.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-02 11:05:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>
<B>Limitation in the study design:</B>
</P>
<P>Methodological quality of included studies was quite good: half of the studies had an adequate sequence generation and only two (5.8%) had it inadequate; 29/34 studies had an unclear allocation concealment and three had inadequate allocation concealment. None of the studies were double blind due to the kind of intervention assessed (psychosocial) which cannot be blinded. 20.5% of studies declared that the outcome assessor was blind. 76% of studies were judged at unclear risk of detection bias. For risk of bias related to incomplete outcome data, 73.5% of studies were judged to be at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>Considering risk of bias at an outcome level, we judged that objective outcomes (retention in treatment, use of substances) were at low risk of bias because they were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding and because considering sequence generation and allocation concealment, we didn't found significant difference in results between studies with low and unclear risk of bias. Moreover, performing a sensitivity analysis including and excluding studies at high risk of bias, the results didn't change. For subjective outcomes nevertheless 76% of studies were judged at unclear risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Indirectness of the evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>None of the included studies included indirect population, interventions, controls or outcomes, so we judged that the level of the body of evidence wasn't downgraded by this limitation.</P>
<P>
<B>Inconsistency in the results:</B>
</P>
<P>We didn't find unexplained heterogeneity or relevant inconsistency in the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Imprecision of the results:</B>
</P>
<P>Results for primary outcomes were not imprecise, whereas results of secondary outcomes had wide confidence intervals due to the low number of included studies and the small number of participants</P>
<P>The quality of evidence of any psychosocial plus any pharmacological Intervention versus any pharmacological standard, assessed according to GRADE method, be judged as high for dichotomous outcomes (retention, abstinence, results at follow up, compliance and moderate for dichotomous outcomes (compliance) see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-08-01 15:10:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>A particularly important component of a review is the identification of relevant studies. Publication bias has long been recognised as a problem in this regard since it means that the likelihood of finding studies is related to the results of those studies. One way to investigate whether a review is subject to publication bias is to prepare a funnel plot and examine this for signs of asymmetry. Funnel plot (plot of the effect estimate from each study against the sample size or effect standard error) was used to assess the potential for bias related to the size of the trials, demonstrating low probability of publication bias <I>see</I> Figure 4</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-01 10:29:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Results of the parallel review on detoxification treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2011</LINK>) shows more benefits of adding psychosocial interventions to the pharmacological one. This may be due to the most robust effects of methadone maintenance treatment itself, as compared to detoxification treatment and possibly to the fact that additional counselling is usually offered as well along with methadone maintenance and not with detoxification.  Another possible explanation is that participants in detoxification are less stable - it is usually a personal crisis that brings them into detoxification - and they have more psychological issues that need to be dealt with. If psychosocial interventions delivered in association with detoxification helps them to deal with these issues, then it seems reasonable to expect that the provision of associated psychosocial interventions might improve the outcomes of detoxification.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-02 12:17:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences between different psychosocial interventions also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.</P>
<P>It was not possible to find a specific psychosocial intervention with strong efficacy, in fact data do not show differences between different interventions also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations.</P>
<P>It is also worth mentioning that, like other patients who have been treated with some kind of psychotherapy, opiate addicts have significant psychiatric problems especially in the areas of depression and anxiety. To the extent that drug use is an attempt to self-medicate for these problems and to the degree that psychosocial intervention, especially psychotherapy, can reduce them, psychotherapy can, perhaps, reduce drug use indirectly in these people. Nevertheless to evaluate these effects it is necessary to observe these patients for long periods and to develop methods for standard assessments of specific outcomes.</P>
<P>Eventually, the results of the review on maintenance treatments clearly show that provision of methadone maintenance treatment should not be abandoned in the absence of resources for additional psychosocial treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-30 10:49:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eventually the review shows that psychosocial interventions can be evaluated in the context of randomised controlled trials, even though in order to study possible added value of any psychosocial treatment over an already effective treatment such as maintenance pharmacological interventions, only big multi site studies could be considered which define experimental interventions and outcomes in the most standardized way possible.</P>

<P>A behavioural treatment based on the assumption that environmental stimuli can act as cues for drug-taking behaviour.

<P>Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy is an active, directive, time-limited system of psychotherapy that focuses on uncovering and understanding the relationship and influence of automatic thoughts and underlying assumptions on problematic feelings and behaviours. The behavioural component consists of deep muscular relaxation training with imaginal and actual approach of conflict situations; identification and practice of verbal and non verbal components of assertiveness; identification of and engagement in pleasant events; isolation and graduated rehearsal of small units of behaviour leading to goal attainment. The Cognitive component includes identification and disputation of irrational assumptions; sensitisation to aversive consequences of drug use; lowering of expectations and restructuring of goal setting strategies; development and contingent application of positive self-statements and evaluations.</P>

<P>Contingency Management is a behavioural treatment based on positive/negative reinforcers used to promote abstinence in in participants in treatment. Many are the contingencies utilized in the included studies both, single or combined. Participants can obtain payment, or win prizes or a (c) take-home pharmacological treatment (methadone or bupreborphine) dose, for drug-free urines or for completing a treatment plan task; furthermore participants can receive half of their pharmacological treatment for clinical attendance and the other half for remaining abstinent. A variant of this approach is the Community Reinforcement Approach, a behavioural treatment intervention based on a social learning theory model intended to rearrange personal and community reinforces. Specific abstinence reinforces in all major aspects of the patient's life are examined; positive reinforces are identified and presented as alternatives to drug use.</P>

<U>5. Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills Model</U>

<I>1. <U>Subliminal Stimulation</U> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Thornton-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 1987</LINK>)</P>
<P>Is based on a psychoanalytic theory that states that unconscious wishes and fantasies have a direct impact on overt behaviour particularly pathological behaviour. The experimental stimuli are designed to activate unconscious wishes and fantasies that have affected behaviour in ways that neutral stimuli have not. The stimuli MOMMY AND I ARE ONE was chosen to activate "symbiotic-like fantasies" of oneness with the "good mother of infancy". This fantasy allays anxiety and mobilizes positive affect, very likely because the unconscious fantasy, the idea of oneness with the mother leaves the person feeling comforted and protected. Furthermore this fantasy enables participants to feel more 'connected' to the therapist and more able to respond to treatment.</P>

<P>The supportive techniques aim to help the participant feel comfortable in discussing his or her personal experiences. The expressive techniques aim to help the participant identify and work through problematic relationship themes. Special attention is paid to themes that are involved in drug dependence, the role of drugs in relation to problem feelings and behaviours and how problems may be solved without recourse to drugs.</P>
