Cross-over is not a suitable study type for this intervention, and in my view the results should not be included if it is crossover as acute conditions may be altered by the first treatment! Short and longer term studies have been separated out for Metaview (sensible). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Dolcetti has been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's New:- fine (please name the new study - Ram I presume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels:- These are not all the correct way around, please check (eg FEV1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also increase the scales so that the summary diamonds are shown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please switch off the totals when only one study is included (#02~ 01 and ~03).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMD needs to be chosen for the pooling statistic in Metaview when change scores are pooled with end of study FEV1 as the SD for change scores is greater and gives more weight. However please check the Dolcetti results (one looks like change and the other end of study).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Dolcetti excluded;  all SDs are for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please add units for title of length of stay (?Days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the symptom scales for Ram is in the same direction as the other studies? If so it can be pooled using SMD but if not the signs need to be reversed for Ram first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The direction of the scales are correct;  the labels were incorrect and have been fixed.  The two scales are arithmetically equivalent and have been combined with SMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with data entry for Wrenn and hospital admissions as more patients are entered than were in the study. The data must be entered as PATIENTS who were admitted not numbers of admissions as the latter is not a dichotomous outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--I don't see the error here.  2/23 pts were admitted in the methyl-xanthine group and 4/16 were admitted in the placebo group.  Please let me know if I am missing something.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis:-  Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT:  WMD is described in the text but SMD may be more appropriate (see comments above on FEV1 and symptom scores). Is the total really 189 patients all told as this does not match Metaview. FEV1 results need to be amended when they have been checked and recaculated as SMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Changes made as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ? Exclude the Cross-over trial and see above. Baseline differences in the Ram study are a problem.  Did this paper give absolute FEV1 as well for comparison?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Dolcetti excluded.  All FEV1 measure are absolute changes (labels changed for clarification).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical endpoints: you describe results as non-significant. Do you mean clinically or statistically? This may need unpacking by describing the confidence intervals and whether a clinically significant benefit lies inside or outside of the CI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Statistically. Text amended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single result from the Ram trial should not be described as WMD and we do not in general report in the text results from a single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Corrected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;Methyl-xanthines had no effect on FEV1 at 2 hours in three trials.&amp;quot; Did you exclude a clinically significant differnce in your CI, if not this needs to be reworded as no significant effect for example.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent to Toby to return to the reviewers for consideration of the above points (23/4/2002)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Methylxanthines for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search strategy section checked &amp;amp; amended 3/3/05 Liz&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:47:02 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="MEX-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.15" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

Data from this review were extracted using uniform methodology.  In addition, one trial included in our 2001 version has been excluded, at the suggestion of commentators and reviewers, due to its crossover design and withholding of standard co-interventions such as B-agonists.  All outcomes were re-analysed after these changes.  The additional data allowed evaluation of several new outcomes, which have been added.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Methylxanthine drugs such as aminophylline and theophylline are recommended for use in patients who have acute exacerbations (episodes) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly for patients unresponsive to standard therapies. This review identified four studies that compared these drugs with placebo. Over the first 2 hours of treatment there was no evidence that patients improved in terms of lung function, although a possible late benefit was detected. The studies do not give a clear indication of whether there was benefit in terms of reduced symptoms or hospital admissions, but side effects were found to be more common with methylxanthines. We conclude that, given current evidence, methylxanthines should not be used for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Most international guidelines currently recommend methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline, aminophylline) for severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet clinical trials underlying this recommendation have been small and underpowered.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the benefit of methylxanthines compared to placebo for COPD exacerbations.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group COPD Register, a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies and reviews were searched. Searches are current to March 2005. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Included studies were limited to RCTs of patients presenting with acute COPD exacerbations, treated with methylxanthines (oral or intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Two reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager 4.1. Studies were pooled to yield weighted mean differences (WMD), standardised mean difference (SMD) or odds ratios (OR) and reported using 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>From 29 identified references, 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria (169 patients). Mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 2 hours was similar in methylxanthine and placebo groups but transiently increased with methylxanthines at 3 days (WMD: 101 ml; 95% CI: 26 to 177). Data on clinical outcomes were sparse. Trends toward improvements in hospitalisation and length-of-stay were offset by a trend toward more relapses at one week. Changes in symptom scores were not significant. Methylxanthines caused more nausea and vomiting than placebo (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.7 to 12.6) and trended toward more frequent tremor, palpitations, and arrhythmias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Given current evidence, methylxanthines should not be used for COPD exacerbations. Possible beneficial effects in lung function and clinical endpoints were modest and inconsistent, whereas adverse effects were significantly increased. More selective agents, tested in larger randomised trials, are necessary if methylxanthines are to have any role in the treatment of COPD exacerbations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:46:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Methylxanthines produce a number of effects that may be beneficial to patients with stable COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Ram_x002d_Rev-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram-Rev 2002</LINK>), including bronchodilation, immuno-modulation, and broncho-protection (<LINK REF="REF-Peleman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peleman 1998</LINK>). They may also influence the course of COPD exacerbations via actions to decrease diaphragmatic muscle fatigue, increase mucociliary clearance, block centrally mediated hypoventilation, and decrease capillary leak (<LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 1996</LINK>); however, the molecular mechanisms of action of methylxanthines are incompletely understood. </P>
<P>Some studies have suggested the clinical impact of methylxanthines to be larger than their modest bronchodilator effects (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials of methylxanthines for COPD exacerbations, however, have been small and have produced conflicting results. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to determine the effect of methylxanthines on the course of COPD exacerbations.</P>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of adding methylxanthines to standard medical care on the course of COPD exacerbations.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:43:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers (RGB, CAC). Authors of trials were contacted to provide missing data and intention-to-treat results, if not previously published. The data were checked and entered by one reviewer. In some cases, information regarding outcomes had to be estimated from graphs; two reviewers performed this independently.</P>
<P>All studies provided measures of standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) for FEV1 at different time points; however, the method of reporting differed between studies. SD was calculated from the SE by multiplying the SE by the square root of the number of subjects in each group. All studies provided the SD or SE of the pre-treatment FEV1. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>) provided an estimate of the variance for the absolute change in FEV1, one (<LINK REF="STD-Seidenfield-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seidenfield 1984</LINK>) provided the SD for relative change in FEV1, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) provided the SD for post-treatment FEV1. The two former studies were therefore directly comparable, whereas the latter two were not. For the latter two studies, individual study results are reported and estimates of the combined effect were made under various assumptions of the covariance. The variance was calculated pre- and post-intervention from the standard deviation at each time-point, and variances were combined using the formula:</P>
<P>Var1,2 = Var2 + Var1 - 2(Covariance1,2)</P>
<P>Since the covariance between time-points was not reported, analyses were performed with: 1) a conservative estimate of no covariance and, 2) with the covariance estimated as:</P>
<P>Covariance1,2 = r*sqrt( Var2 * Var1)<BR/>
<BR/>where r is the correlation coefficient between Var2 and Var1 among all the included trials. The variance of the mean difference, Var1,2, was converted to the SD of the mean difference.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:43:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane approach and the Jadad criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The Cochrane approach rates trials based on their description of allocation concealment whereas the Jadad criteria is a 0-5 point scale based on randomisation, blinding, and reported losses to follow-up. Two reviewers (RGB, CAC) independently extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to provide missing data and intention-to-treat results, when necessary. In some cases, information regarding outcomes was estimated from graphs; in these instances, the two reviewers performed this independently.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:43:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials were combined using the Review Manager and were analysed according to intention-to-treat. For continuous variables, mean difference and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated for each study. All similar studies were pooled using weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. For dichotomous variables, an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated for individual studies and pooled results. Heterogeneity among pooled estimates was tested; p &lt; 0.1 was considered statistically significant. Where there was no significant heterogeneity, results of the fixed effects model are reported; where there was significant heterogeneity, a random effects model was used.</P>

<P>Additional sensitivity analyses were performed using random effects vs. fixed effects modeling. The data were not evaluated for the presence of publication bias since published trials were predominantly negative, suggesting the absence of publication bias, and too few trials were available to perform a meaningful evaluation.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:44:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Three studies included in the overview were published in the peer-reviewed literature and the fourth has been published in abstract form. The characteristics of the studies are described in Table 2. The included trials yielded results for 169 patients. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Seidenfield-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seidenfield 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) involved patients presenting to emergency departments and the other two studied hospitalised patients.

In general, standard therapy consisted of inhaled beta-agonists and anti-cholinergics, supplemental oxygen, steroids, and antibiotics.</P>
<P>Three of the four studies made substantial efforts to restrict asthmatic patients from the analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) enrolled both asthma and COPD patients and then reported both combined and stratified results.

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Concealment of allocation was unclear (Grade B) in all four. Using criteria of Jadad, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>) scored 5/5, and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Seidenfield-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seidenfield 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) scored 4/5 for reporting of randomisation, blinding and follow-up. </P>

<P>Two trials reported baseline and change in FEV1 at 2 hours. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Seidenfield-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seidenfield 1984</LINK>) reported a small, non-significant benefit with methylxanthines (relative change in FEV1: 27% [95% CI: 3 to 51%] for methylxanthines vs 22% [95% CI: 13 to 31%] for placebo), whereas the other (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) showed a non-significant worsening with methylxanthines (relative change in FEV1: 28% for methylxanthines vs 37% for placebo [95% CI, not estimatable from available data]). Due to variation in reporting, these trials could not be combined without additional assumptions. Estimates of the combined effect were made under various assumptions. All estimates of the combined effect showed a smaller improvement in FEV1 at 2 hours with methylxanthines than with placebo; in no cases was the difference statistically significant, although for some estimates the 95% CI excluded any clinically meaningful benefit (e.g, WMD: -36 ml; 95% CI: -134 to 63 ml, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials provided data on change in FEV1 at 3 days of hospitalisation. The pooled results of the trials for FEV1 were homogenous (P=0.36), and a fixed effects model showed a combined WMD of 101 ml (95% CI: 26 to 177ml, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) in favour of methylxanthines. Only one (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>) of the two trials, however, showed a benefit of methylxanthines. In that trial, baseline FEV1 was considerably lower in intervention group than the placebo group (0.59L and 0.68L, respectively; a difference of 90 ml). The improvement in FEV1 in methylxanthine compared to placebo arms in that trial was only observed at days 3 and 4 over 7 days of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>). Severity of COPD, as measured by baseline FEV1, was similar in the two trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical Endpoints</HEADING>
<P>Of the pre-specified endpoints, data on admissions were available from only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>). This trial showed a statistically non-significant reduction in hospital admissions with methylxanthine use (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1 to 1.8). Data on relapses within seven days requiring return to the emergency department were reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidenfield-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Seidenfield 1984</LINK>). These revealed a statistically non-significant increase in relapses in the methylxanthine group (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4 to 5.2). Among hospitalised patients, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>) demonstrated a statistically non-significant reduction in length-of-stay in the methylxanthine group (absolute difference: -1.4 days; 95% CI: -2.9 to 0.1) in intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Symptom Scores</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted for improvement in any symptom-based scale. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>) reported changes in symptom scores over several hours as a dichotomised result. Seidenfield reported mean differences in 4 symptom scores over the same time interval; however, these were not interpretable as a dichotomous outcome.</P>
<P>The two studies that examined symptom scores in hospitalised patients over 3 days reported comparable, continuous outcomes which were comparable as improvement in a 100 point (overall) symptom score. Results at 3 days demonstrated heterogeneity (P&lt;0.001), with one study reporting a trend toward benefit and the other reporting a statistically significant harm. The combined estimate suggested a small, non-significant worsening of symptoms with methylxanthines (SMD: -1.4; 95% CI: -5.1 to 2.4). The extracted 3-day symptom score for the intervention group in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1987</LINK>) was unrepresentative of the overall trend for symptom score in that trial. Re-extraction of the closest, more representative score (at 2.5 days) and re-analysis using this measure removed the heterogeneity in the analysis (P=0.69) and revealed an even smaller, non-significant improvement with methylxanthines (SMD: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.9; P=0.05).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse Effects</HEADING>
<P>Three trials reported adverse effects of methylxanthines (<LINK REF="STD-Wrenn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wrenn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>). The trials were homogeneous for all adverse event outcomes, therefore the results of fixed effects models are reported. The odds of nausea or vomiting were significantly higher for patients receiving a methylxanthine (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.7 to 12.6) than for patients receiving placebo. Trends toward more frequent tremor (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 0.7 to 4.6) and palpitations and arrhythmias (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 0.9 to 19.6) were observed. Other adverse effects were not reported frequently enough to allow combination. One definite myocardial infarction and one patient with acute T-wave inversion and hyperglycemia suggestive of a myocardial infarction were reported among 97 patients receiving methylxanthines. One intubation was reported in both the methylxanthine and placebo groups, and no deaths were reported during treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This meta-analysis examined the available randomised controlled trials on methylxanthines in COPD exacerbations and did not show a consistent benefit. Whereas a variety of potential benefits of methylxanthines on clinical outcomes were not confirmed at standard levels of statistical significance, nausea and vomiting were significantly elevated compared to placebo, and other adverse events were non-significantly increased.</P>
<P>Methylxanthines had no consistent effect on FEV1 at 2 hours. At 3 days, the change in FEV1 was greater in the methylxanthine group, based heavily on the results from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>). However, this finding may have been biased by an imbalance in baseline FEV1 in that study. The difference in baseline FEV1 between the theophylline and placebo groups was approximately as large as the difference in change in FEV1 between two groups, such that the FEV1 at the end of follow-up 3 days was the same in treatment and placebo groups. In addition, in the original report (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>), the differential improvement observed in FEV1 at 3 days disappeared with follow-up greater than 3 days.</P>
<P>Our intention was to examine clinical outcomes and symptom scores, but this was constrained by sparse data and reporting vagaries. A trend toward fewer hospitalisations among emergency department patients in one study was offset by a trend toward a greater number of treatment relapses among patients sent home from the emergency department. Hospital length-of-stay was shorter among patients receiving theophylline than among those receiving placebo, although this result was not statistically significant. In the original study (<LINK REF="STD-Ram-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ram 2000</LINK>), length-of-stay was significantly reduced; however, this was not an intention-to-treat analysis. Changes in symptom scores in the methylxanthine group did not differ significantly from changes in the placebo group. The magnitude of these changes was clinically unimportant, and the direction inconsistent depending on the analysis.</P>
<P>In contrast to findings for lung function and clinical endpoints, the higher risk of adverse events was statistically significant and consistent. The proportion of patients with nausea and vomiting was elevated in the methylxanthine group, such that more than a third of patients developing nausea or vomiting with methylxanthine use. Needless to say, nausea and vomiting may not be trivial side effects in patients in severe respiratory distress. Tremor and palpitations - including non-malignant arrhythmias - also were elevated in the methylxanthine group, although not to statistically significant levels.</P>
<P>Most current international recommendations suggest the use of methylxanthines for severe COPD exacerbations or exacerbations that are not responding aerosol therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siafakas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siafakas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1997</LINK>). We had limited power to examine differences by subgroup of severity of exacerbations; however, no trends toward greater benefit were apparent for more severe exacerbations. In fact, all four studies evaluated the addition of a methylxanthine to aerosol therapy and enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbations (pre-treatment FEV1 range 0.6-0.8 L). Our results therefore apply to the target population of these recommendations. Our findings concur with the recommendations of the joint panel of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians, which recommended against use of methylxanthines for COPD exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bach-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The major limitation of this meta-analysis was the paucity of randomised trial data. Whilst we could find no evidence of an early effect of methylxanthines on FEV1 at 2 hours, we could not reach firm conclusions about improvements in clinical endpoints and were unable to evaluate properly potential benefits in subgroups of patients such as patients with more severe disease. There is a possibility of publication and selection bias in any meta-analysis; however, publication bias is unlikely to affect this analysis since the published trials were predominantly negative. To avoid selection bias, a systematic and comprehensive search was conducted and two reviewers independently evaluated trials for inclusion. In addition, we will continue to update the current review so it is unlikely that any trials in publication will be missed. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The available data do not support the use of methylxanthines for the treatment of COPD exacerbations. Potential benefits of methylxanthines on lung function or symptoms were generally not confirmed at standard levels of significance, whereas adverse events of nausea and vomiting was significantly increased in patients receiving methylxanthines.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The current meta-analysis summarised data from a small number of trials involving relatively few patients. Based on its results, we anticipate that any potential clinical benefit found for methylxanthines in an adequately powered, large randomised trial would be offset by increased adverse effects. However, investigations of newer, more selective agents may have a better risk-benefit profile. Until this evidence is available, methylxanthines should not be used for COPD exacerbations. Rather, physicians treating severe exacerbations of COPD should focus on applying treatments for which evidence of effectiveness exists, such as inhaled bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-McCrory-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrory 2002</LINK>), systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Wood_x002d_Baker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood-Baker 2002</LINK>), antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1995</LINK>), and non-invasive ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Peter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2002</LINK>). </P>
