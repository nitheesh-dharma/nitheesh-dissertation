<P>Current update</P>
<P>This updates the review 'Inositol for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants' (<LINK REF="REF-Howlett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlett 2012</LINK>). One additional trial was included (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK>) and one ongoing trial was identified (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01954082" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01954082</LINK>). The infants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK> were not included based on whether they had respiratory distress syndrome or not. To justify inclusion of this study we changed the title of the review to 'Inositol in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome'. We changed the objectives to read: To assess the effectiveness and safety of supplementary inositol in preterm infants with or without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.</P>

<P>Review question</P>
<P>Does the administration of supplementary inositol reduce adverse outcomes in preterm infants with or without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)?</P>
<P>Background</P>
<P>Inositol is an essential nutrient for cells, with high concentrations in breast milk (particularly in the breast milk of mothers whose babies have been born early). A drop in inositol levels in babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) can be a sign that their illness will be severe.</P>
<P>Study characteristics</P>
<P>Four published randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Results</P>
<P>We found that the initial evidence regarding inositol supplementation in preterm babies with RDS is promising. Supplementation lowered rates of death and bleeding in the brain, with an important reduction in eye problems as well. Inositol did not have serious adverse effects. Further research is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. Such research is currently ongoing in the USA.</P>

<P>All RCTs of inositol supplementation of preterm infants compared with a control group that received a placebo or no intervention were included.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-24 21:26:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four published RCTs and one ongoing RCT were identified. Study quality varied and interim analyses had occurred in all trials of repeat doses of inositol that provided data for the outcomes of interest in this review. In these trials neonatal death was found to be significantly reduced (3 trials, 355 neonates; typical RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.91; typical RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.03; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 33). Infant deaths were reduced (3 trials, 355 infants; typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77; typical RD -0.18, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.08; NNTB 6, 95% CI 4 to 13). ROP stage &#8805; 3 was significantly reduced (2 trials, 262 infants; typical RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.03; NNTB 13, 95% CI 8 to 33) and IVH grade &gt; II was significantly decreased (3 trials, 355 infants; typical RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.90; typical RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.02; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 50). Neither sepsis nor NEC differed significantly between groups. One study (74 infants) that administered a single dose of inositol (60 or 120 mg/kg) found no significant differences in adverse outcomes using RR, but an increased RD for BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (RD 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.43; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 33). This result should be interpreted with caution as only one dose of inositol was given and only the RD, but not the RR, was significant. One ongoing large study of repeat doses of inositol in preterm infants was identified.</P>

<P>Inositol supplementation results in statistically significant and clinically important reductions in important short-term adverse neonatal outcomes.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-24 06:29:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As more preterm infants survive beyond the neonatal period, the incidence of long-term complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can be expected to increase. The relative contributions of risk factors such as barotrauma, oxygen therapy and nutritional status have yet to be fully understood. Interest has recently focused on the use of myo-inositol (inositol) supplementation in preterm infants for the prevention of BPD and ROP (<LINK REF="STD-Hallman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hallman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hallman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hallman 1992</LINK>). Inositol is a six-carbon sugar alcohol found widely throughout mammalian tissues in its free form as the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol, and in cell membranes as a phosphoinositide (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasan-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasan 1974</LINK>). Inositol is an essential nutrient required by human cells in culture for growth and survival (<LINK REF="REF-Eagle-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 1957</LINK>). The effects of deprivation and supplementation in animals have been studied extensively (<LINK REF="REF-Egberts-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egberts 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1984</LINK>). Inositol promotes maturation of the surfactant phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, and the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol in type II pneumocytes appears to be dependent on extracellular inositol concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1984</LINK>). Compositional changes in fetal rat lung surfactant correlate with changes in plasma inositol levels, and supplementation increases phospholipid levels to normal in the deprived rat pup (<LINK REF="REF-Egberts-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egberts 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guarner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1980</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-08 15:08:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inositol is administered intravenously as long as the infant is not on full oral feeds. When the infant progresses to full feeds inositol is given orally or via an oro-gastric tube.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-24 21:17:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In human infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a premature drop in serum inositol levels predicts a more severe course of the syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1985</LINK>). Inositol supplementation increases the amount of saturated phosphatidylcholine in surfactant in newborns and produces a rise in serum inositol concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1987</LINK>). In humans, free inositol levels in sera from preterm neonates are 2 to 20 times higher than are levels in maternal or adult sera (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 1978</LINK>). Studies in newborns suggest an endogenous synthesis of inositol during fetal life (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1990</LINK>). Human milk has a high concentration of inositol, with preterm milk being the richest source. Infants who are breast fed have higher serum inositol levels compared to those that are not breastfed at one to two weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1990</LINK>). These facts suggest a critical role for inositol in fetal and early neonatal life. Several studies have been published assessing serum inositol levels in the preterm human infant (<LINK REF="REF-Bromberger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromberger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1990</LINK>) as well as the effects of inositol supplementation. However, at the time of our original Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Howlett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlett 1997</LINK>) only two published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of inositol supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Hallman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hallman 1986</LINK>, and an interim analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Hallman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hallman 1992</LINK> published in 1990) had been subjected to systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). As additional evidence has become available, another critical overview of the use of inositol supplementation that includes all known trials to date was warranted. Maintaining inositol concentrations similar to those occurring naturally in utero may reduce the rates of ROP and BPD in preterm infants.</P>

<P>For the original review and previous updates of the review the main comparison has been inositol supplementation versus control (Comparison 1) and we included studies under this comparison that provided repeated doses of inositol to the infants. For this update, we identified one dose-finding study in which infants were supplemented with a single dose of inositol (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK>). We did not consider it appropriate to include the results of this study in the meta-analyses of repeat doses of inositol and we have changed the first comparison to: inositol supplementation (repeat doses) versus control (Comparison 1) and added a second comparison: iInositol supplementation (single dose) versus control (Comparison 2). These different dosing regimens were not known at the protocol stage and we have made a deviation from the protocol and included a single dose of inositol in our review as those analyses provide important information.</P>
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-24 22:25:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update the three review authors reviewed the titles (and abstracts when available) in CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, PAS abstracts2view and handsearch printouts.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-01-24 22:30:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We developed data extraction forms. The three review authors independently abstracted information on each study and checked for any discrepancies. AO pooled the results. Data abstraction included: the time period and geographical location of the study, baseline characteristics of the patients, inclusion and exclusion criteria, preparation, route of administration and dosing regime of inositol and placebo. Information on outcomes and numbers of affected infants was abstracted. Outcomes included neonatal and infant deaths. The total number of infants with BPD at 28 to 30 days of life (oxygen requirements above the concentration in room air at 28 days of life and a chest roentgenogram compatible with BPD); BPD at 36 to 38 weeks PMA (oxygen requirements above the concentration in room air at 36 to 38 weeks PMA and a chest roentgenogram compatible with BPD) was abstracted as well as information on ROP (stage 0 to 2; &#8805; 3), IVH (all grades and grade &gt; 2), NEC and sepsis. Any adverse effects reported by the authors were to be abstracted.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-25 00:11:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An assessment of the quality of the included studies was performed independently by the three review authors (AH, AO, NP). The methodological criteria used to appraise each paper were: the concealment of treatment allocation, blinding of intervention, blinding of observers, and exclusion and withdrawals. Each criterion was graded 'A', 'B' or 'C'. 'A' indicates a low risk of bias, where the plausibly postulated bias is unlikely to seriously alter the results; 'C' indicates a high risk of bias, where the plausibly postulated bias seriously weakens confidence in the results. A criterion was graded 'B' where it was partially met or where no data were available such that some doubt was raised about possible bias. Each paper was graded independently by two review authors with disagreements resolved by discussion. Methodological assessments were not conducted blind to author, institution, journal of publication or results, as the review authors were familiar with most of the studies. In addition, the results sections of articles often included methodological information. The quality of included trials was evaluated independently by the review authors using the following criteria.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Blinding of randomisation?</LI>
<LI>Blinding of intervention?</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome measure assessment?</LI>
<LI>Completeness of follow-up?</LI>
</UL>
<P>There were three potential answers to these questions: yes, can't tell, no.</P>
<P>For the update in 2011 and the subsequent update in 2014, the following questions (based on the questions in the risk of bias table) were evaluated by the three review authors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>Selection bias</I>
</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Random sequence generation</HEADING>

<P>Low risk: adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator).<BR/>High risk: inadequate (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).<BR/>Unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes).<BR/>High risk: inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth).<BR/>Unclear risk: no or unclear information provided .</P>

<I>Performance bias</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention.</P>
<P>Low risk: adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group).<BR/>High risk: inadequate, personnel aware of group assignment.<BR/>Uncelar risk: no or unclear information provided.</P>

<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods used with regards to detection bias as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: adequate; follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group.<BR/>High risk: inadequate; assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;assignment.<BR/>Unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>Attrition bias</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: adequate (&lt; 10% missing data).<BR/>High risk: inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data).<BR/>Unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>Reporting bias</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported).<BR/>High risk: inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported).<BR/>Unclear risk: no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">
<I>Other bias</I>
</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: no concerns of other bias raised.<BR/>High risk: concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper.<BR/>Unclear: concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.<BR/>
</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For the original review, independent quality assessments were conducted by two review authors (AH, AO), who were not blinded to authors, institution or journal of publication.</P>
<P>The update in 2011 and the update in 2014 were conducted by three authors (AH, AO, NP).<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-25 02:35:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Statistically significant reductions in neonatal deaths, infant deaths and IVH grade &gt; 2 in infants were demonstrated with repeat doses of inositol supplementation, and a striking reduction was found in ROP stage &#8805; 3. There was no significant reduction in BPD. There was no significant increase in potentially adverse effects such as sepsis, NEC or neurological impairment at 12 months corrected age. For neonatal deaths and infants deaths there was no significant heterogeneity for RR (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), but there was for RD (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58% for neonatal deaths and 72% for infant deaths). There was no significant heterogeneity for either RR or RD for ROP &#8805; stage 3 or all stages (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD).</P>
<P>A 'Single dose intravenous inositol pharmacokinetics in preterm infants' study has been completed in the US (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK>). As inositol was administered in a single dose of either 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg or we did not think it was appropriate to combine the results of this study with the results of the other studies that used repeat doses of inositol. In this study there were no significant results noted for death during hospital stay, the number infants who underwent surgery for ROP, NEC (stage 2A or worse, or number of infants who underwent surgery), late onset sepsis, IVH (grade 3 or 4) or number of infants who failed hearing tests on both ears. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks PMA for RR, but an increased RD (NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 33) was noted.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-25 03:37:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of studies available for analysis remains small. These results suggest the need for additional RCTs of inositol supplementation. The numbers of neonates enrolled in two of the reviewed trials were quite small. The estimates of effect, both in the individual trials and in the meta-analyses, are not very precise, as indicated by the large confidence intervals. Future multi-centre RCTs of inositol supplementation are required both to confirm the benefits suggested in this review and to assess possible adverse effects on short and long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>A large multi-centre study is being undertaken in the US (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01954082" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01954082</LINK>). This study will enrol 1760 preterm infants &lt; 28 0/7 weeks PMA. It is likely that this study will confirm or refute the promising results of the repeat inositol supplementation studies included in this review. The primary outcome of this study is incidence of survival without severe ROP through acute and final ROP determination up to 55 weeks PMA.</P>

<P>Based on the evidence from RCTs to date, inositol supplementation results in important reductions in the rates of neonatal and infant deaths, IVH grades 3 or 4, and ROP stage &#8805; 3. However, these conclusions are based on a limited number of patients. They require confirmation in large multi-centre trials before inositol supplementation is routinely instituted as part of the nutritional management of preterm infants with or without RDS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-25 02:55:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As there have been only three RCTs to date that contributed data to assess the efficacy and safety of repeat doses of inositol supplementation, two of them quite small, very large trials with more power are warranted in order to more reliably assess the effects of this promising intervention and establish the generalization of the results. Such trials should assess effects on a wide spectrum of short and long-term outcomes including PVL and neurodevelopmental status at 18 months corrected age. If the benefits of inositol supplementation in preterm infants with RDS are confirmed, further trials will be needed to assess the effect in preterm infants without RDS, and to determine the best route of administration, dose and dose schedule, and duration of supplementation. Such research has been initiated with the support of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Eye Institute (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2012NCT01954082" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2012NCT01954082</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01954082" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01954082</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the original review and previous updates of the review the main comparison has been 'inositol supplementation versus control' (Comparison 1) and we included studies under this comparison that provided repeated doses of inositol to the infants. For this update we identified one dose-finding study in which infants were supplemented with a single dose of inositol (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK>). We did not consider it appropriate to include the results of this study in the meta-analyses of repeated doses of inositol and we have changed the first comparison to read: 'inositol supplementation (repeat doses) versus control' (Comparison 1) and added a second comparison that reads 'inositol supplementation (single dose) versus control' (Comparison 2). These different dosing regimens were not known at the protocol stage and we have made a deviation from the protocol and included single doses of inositol in our review as those analyses provide important information. The infants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK> were not included based on whether they had respiratory distress syndrome or not. To justify inclusion of this study we changed the title of the review to 'Inositol in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome'. For this update we changed the objectives to read: to assess the effectiveness and safety of supplementary inositol in preterm infants with or without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Outcomes were not reported in an identical manner in the repeat doses of inositol studies and the single dose of inositol study (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK>). We accepted the outcomes and their definitions reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Phelps-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 2013</LINK> study.</P>
