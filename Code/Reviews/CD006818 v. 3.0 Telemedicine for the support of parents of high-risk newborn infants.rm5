<P>Telemedicine uses information technology so that doctors or nurses can communicate with their patients when they are not in the same room. The parents of sick infants who are treated in neonatal intensive care units require a lot of support when their child is ill and when they are taking their baby home. Telemedicine may be able to help the doctors and nurses to improve provision of support to the parents. This review identified one trial which did not show that telemedicine alters the time these infants stay in hospital. However, there was some imprecision of the published data in this study that makes it difficult to make firm recommendations either way with telemedicine.</P>

<P>A single study was included for analysis in this review. This study compared the use of telemedicine (Baby Carelink) for parents and families of infants in the NICU with a control group without access to this programme and assessed the length of hospital stay for the infants and family satisfaction in multiple components of infant care. The study shows no difference in the length of hospital stay (average length of stay: telemedicine group: 68.5 days (standard deviation (SD) 28.3 days), control group: 70.6 days (SD 35.6 days), MD -2.10 days (95% confidence interval: -18.85 to 14.65 days).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-26 22:27:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Telemedicine enables the practitioner or physician to deliver health care without being in the same physical location as the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Strehle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehle 2006</LINK>). One definition relevant to the paediatric population provided by Spooner and Gottlieb is "the use of electronic communications technology to provide and support health care for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults when distance separates the practitioner from the patient, parent, guardian or referring practitioner" (<LINK REF="REF-Spooner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spooner 2004</LINK>). In earlier usages of the term, telemedicine (which means "medicine at a distance") implies communication between doctors and patient in different physical locations where direct face-to-face consultation is not feasible using ancillary means of communication such as telephone and radio (<LINK REF="REF-McLaren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-26 22:27:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More recently, the meaning of telemedicine has been expanded following the introduction of the Internet and other advances in electronic and information technologies (<LINK REF="REF-Currell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currell 2000</LINK>). The newer applications in telemedicine range from web-based interactive image-enriched patient-specific information resources (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2003</LINK>) and teleconferencing with audio and video capabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2001</LINK>) to the use of electronic accessories in the operating room (<LINK REF="REF-Whitten-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitten 2004</LINK>).Telemedicine can thus be seen as a subset within the wider field of medical informatics (<LINK REF="REF-Nagendran-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagendran 2000</LINK>). The terms "telehealth", "online health" and "e-health" are now also being used interchangeably with telemedicine (<LINK REF="REF-Wootton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wootton 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two main forms of telemedicine are the synchronous or real time variety (face-to-face) and the asynchronous variety where the information is recorded (<LINK REF="REF-Jaatinen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaatinen 2002</LINK>). In the synchronous variety, data, images and sound are transmitted live and the health professional may have direct video contact with the patient. In the asynchronous (store and forward technique), information for example, X-Ray images may be acquired in one location and then reviewed in another at a later stage (<LINK REF="REF-Strehle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehle 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Telemedicine has been developed in countries such as Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Roine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roine 2001</LINK>) and Norway (<LINK REF="REF-Pettersen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettersen 1999</LINK>) where a relatively small rural population is spread over a large area, making face-to-face medical consultations difficult. The application of telemedicine has been reported in the delivery of primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Marcin-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcin 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcin-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcin 2004b</LINK>), child health (<LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2001</LINK>), specialist care in cardiology (<LINK REF="REF-Sable-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sable 2002</LINK>) and home monitoring of stable chronic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1997</LINK>). However, the overall cost effectiveness of telemedicine in child health is still largely unproven (<LINK REF="REF-Strehle-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehle 2006a</LINK>). In fact, a recent evaluation suggests that telemedicine is not a cost effective way of delivering health care (<LINK REF="REF-Whitten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitten 2002</LINK>). <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Telemedicine applications for remote monitoring of infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is technically feasible. A web-based monitoring application for infants in the NICU (<LINK REF="REF-Shin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shin 2003</LINK>) has been described. However, in this study, the monitoring station was located within the NICU, although it would have been feasible for monitoring to be performed at some distance away from the NICU. The current model of delivery of care in the NICU is for the neonatologists to deliver care in person. However, telemedicine applications for adult intensive care units allow intensivists (critical care physicians) to deliver consultation when they are not physically at the patient's bedside (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-26 06:21:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, the development of telemedicine in neonatal care has a different focus, targeting mainly the parents or family. Telemedicine support is needed in neonatal care because of the vast amount of specialised information available regarding the care of the sick newborn, the prognosis of these newborns and the roles and skills expected of the parents at discharge, given the limitations of what most parents can realistically absorb within their visiting time in the neonatal unit. Telemedicine should, therefore, aim not to lessen the parents' need to travel to the hospital, but to provide a portal through which they can access information pertinent to the care of their newborn infants at their own time and place of choice. Hopefully, better understanding by the parents regarding the care of their infants can contribute to improved outcomes. Daily updates may come in the form of "infant's diary" in an attempt to personalize the progress of the infants for the family. An example of this use of telemedicine is the "BabyLink" program, a web-based program that automatically generates a daily update summarising the infant's clinical progress through a secure web-based server (<LINK REF="REF-Freer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freer 2005</LINK>). An observational study (comparing two NICUs) has shown that telemedicine used to aid the turnaround time of neonatal echocardiography interpretation may reduce the length of hospital stay of very low birthweight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Rendina-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rendina 1998</LINK>). This may translate into benefits such as cost reduction from early neonatal discharges (<LINK REF="REF-Speer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spinner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinner 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-26 22:28:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of telemedicine versus face-to-face patient care found variable and inconclusive results, but pointed out the feasibility of conducting randomised
 controlled trials of telemedicine applications (<LINK REF="REF-Currell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currell 2000</LINK>). However, a lack of uniformity in the definitions of telemedicine has complicated the assessment of its effectiveness. For example, opinions vary on whether the use of telephone in a healthcare setting constitutes telemedicine (<LINK REF="REF-McLaren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thrall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thrall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Currell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hersh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spooner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spooner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wootton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wootton 2006</LINK>). The evolving characteristics and applications in telemedicine serve only to further broaden its definition. To derive a practical message on the effectiveness of telemedicine, systematic reviews may have to focus on a specific application or setting. This review examines one such application of telemedicine in the NICU that provides information, education and support to the families of sick newborns in the unit. This review assesses whether telemedicine, when applied as an additional resource, can enhance standard parental support.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-05-14 12:55:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The preliminary MEDLINE search yielded 324 studies. After inspection of the titles, seven studies appeared to be potentially eligible in terms of relevance and methodology or both. After a detailed inspection of the abstracts, we judged that only one out of the seven studies met the selection criteria. The characteristics of the single included study and the six excluded studies are detailed in the tables <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>, respectively.</P>
<P>A search of the online register of clinical trials, <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A> did not reveal any study meeting the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2000</LINK> was the single study that met the inclusion criteria. It was a single-centre randomised control trial conducted from 1 November 1997 to 30 March 1999. The population consisted of inborn very low birthweight (VLBW) infants admitted to a NICU in Boston (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre) and their families. Fifty-six infants had been randomised (30 control and 26 intervention) within 10 days of birth (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The main exclusion criteria were lack of high speed telephone (ISDN) lines at the family's residence and an expected stay of under two weeks at this NICU. Other exclusion criteria were lack of permanent residence for the family, lack of competence in English, expected discharge to other than the biological family and finally at the decision of the attending neonatologist. The intervention was the Baby CareLink system which was an online resource (with video conferencing facility) that the family could access through the Internet from their home computer. Each family in the intervention group was given a single training session (lasting from 40 to 120 minutes) on the use of the hardware and software. The hardware consisted of the ISDN telephone lines (installed by local telephone company) and computing and videoconferencing hardware (installed by local hardware vendor) which were in place mostly 12 days after randomisation. The Baby CareLink web site had six main sections that each dealt with issues that were of concern to the families during their baby's NICU stay and at the time of discharge;a daily clinical report, a message centre, a 'see your infant' section, a family room, a clinical information section, and a section focused on preparation for discharge to home. The families of infants in the control group received standard information and support from NICU staff. The outcome measures were death or discharge disposition from the NICU, date of discharge from NICU and discharge home as well as the frequency of family visits, telephone calls to the NICU, and holding of the infant (including 'kangaroo care'). The quality of care was rated by the family based on the 80-item Picker Institure's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Family Satisfaction survey administered at one and four months post-discharge.</P>
<P>Among the excluded studies, none was found to be relevant after reading the abstracts, as they either assessed the use of telemedicine technologies for clinical diagnosis rather than for education and support (<LINK REF="STD-Robie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Robie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatikar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatikar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dowie 2009</LINK>) or they did not include parents of high-risk newborn infants as participants (<LINK REF="STD-Guillen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guillen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCrossan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCrossan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dowie 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2000</LINK>, based on the published description of the methods, it can be inferred that the sequence generation was adequate but it was unclear whether the allocation was concealed. In terms of concealment, blinding of the intervention was not possible. Although blinding of outcome assessments that depended on parental reporting was not possible, blinding of the researchers when assessing other outcomes such as disposition of discharge and recording of family visits and holding of the infants was not reported. A detailed 'Risk of bias' table is included under <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, along with a 'Risk of bias' graph (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and a 'Risk of bias' summary (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of reporting of results, the event rates and/or the total number of participants analysed for all the outcomes were not presented in the published paper, thus not allowing for further meta-analysis. There was also no description on the assigned groups of the five families who did not complete the postdischarge survey.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-05-14 12:55:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2000</LINK> examined the effects of telemedicine support on the level of family satisfaction on infant care and length of hospital stay. The outcome of interest for this review, the length of hospital stay, did not differ between the Baby Carelink telemedicine group and the control groups (68.5 ± 28.3 days in telemedicine group versus 70.6 ± 35.6 days in the control group, mean difference: -2.10 days (95% confidence interval -18.85 to 14.65 days) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> ). The group that was randomised to standard care included a significant number of infants who were back-transferred to their local level two nurseries. In fact, 20% of the control group were back-transferred while no infants in the intervention group were back-transferred.</P>
<P>Frequency of accessing telemedicine access (Baby CareLink) was reported for the intervention arm of this study. NICU and project staff initiated 1033 sessions during the study period while 26 families initiated 1744 sessions (26 sessions per family, mostly from home) during the same period. The average time of these sessions for all users was 5.4 minutes. During this time, there were 328 family-initiated videoconferencing sessions which lasted an average of six minutes. The Baby CareLink areas most likely to be visited by the families were specific to the infants (for example the picture gallery 91%, daily report 57% and message centre 46% of the time). As this outcome was not reported (as it was not applicable) to the control arm, this outcome will not be subjected to more analysis in this review.</P>
<P>For the outcomes of family satisfaction assessed using the Picker Institute&#8217;s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Family Satisfaction Survey, the authors reported that CareLink usage was associated with significant improvements in family satisfaction in the overall quality of care and environment and visitation dimensions (under "Results", paragraph 7, lines 1 to 4). Figures 2 and 3 in the study illustrate, in general, better scoring in the survey favouring the Baby Carelink group. As we did not have the primary data that constitute the figures from the authors, we were not able to apply further analysis to this group of outcomes.</P>
<P>Our summary of findings with the authors' judgment on the overall quality of evidence is presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> .</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-04-05 04:13:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are some deficiencies in the reporting of the results from the single included study. In the selection of the patient group, the study appeared to select families who lived close to urban centres (as evidenced by using lack of ISDN coverage as an exclusion criteria) and who were presumably of higher socioeconomic status (competence in English). This will likely affect the applicability of the findings to other patient populations. The substantial difference in the rates of back-transfer to the local level two nursery between the intervention group and the control group could represent significant selection or performance bias, or an outcome as a result of the different interventions received. Furthermore, the very wide confidence interval of the difference in the length of hospital stay in this study shows imprecise estimate of the treatment effect size; likely due to a sample size that was inadequately powered. Overall, there was little information available for the authors of this review to make any conclusions regarding most of the outcomes. For the only analysable outcome of the length of hospital stay, the overall quality of evidence (GRADE) was very low (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the rapid advances in information technologies over the recent two decades since this study, it is likely that telemedicine applications have evolved, and there is a possibility that in some NICUs telemedicine applications might have become the standard tools for infant care or parental support. The advent of mobile computing and social networking technology might have facilitated the implementation of telemedicine. There is a need for high-quality research in the form of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-RCTs on the effects of telemedicine application in the NICU setting as an educational and support tool for parents or caregivers of infants in the NICU. Comparison should be made between telemedicine, either used alone or alongside other educational or support tools and other support or educational methods without telemedicine in settings where telemedicine technologies have not become the standard facilities for infant care. In settings where telemedicine technologies have been implemented, comparison between different forms of telemedicine facilities may be made. Major outcomes that should be considered include any outcome that is reflective of the care process such as the length of hospital stay, parental satisfaction and confidence, and the frequency of emergency hospital visits post-discharge of infants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-05 04:14:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering the advances in information technologies over the recent decades, there is a remarkable lack of research in the use of telemedicine in supporting caregivers of infants in NICU. Clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits of telemedicine technology to the NICU population and their caregivers in improving infant care, enabling earlier discharge and improving parental support and education pre- and post-discharge of infants. Depending on the study setting, comparisons may be made between the use of telemedicine versus no telemedicine or between different forms of telemedicine facilities. </P>

<P>Very low birth weight infants (n = 75) within 10 days of birth born between November 1997 and April 1999. Infants whose family's primary residences do not have ISDN access, families with no permanent address, non-English speaking families, discharge to other than biological family, and infants expected to stay in the participating NICU for &lt; 14 days for various reasons were excluded.

<P>Families of infants allocated to intervention were given access to the Baby Carelink telemedicine application, with a multimedia computer, Internet access and videoconferencing equipments installed in their homes within 3 weeks of birth. There are six components in the Baby Carelink Web telemedicine application, including a daily clinical report, a message centre, a "see-your-infant" section, a family room, a clinical information section and a section on preparing for discharge. 26 infants were randomised into the intervention group; 7 of their siblings also were allocated to the intervention arm, making 33. Control group received standard neonatal care. 30 infants were randomised to the control arm, with 12 of their siblings also allocated to the control arm with them</P>

There was no additional report on "family visitation", as implied to be a separate outcome based on the statements above. There was also no report of any form on "interactions with infant and staff" in the results</P>
<P>The major outcome of family satisfaction, measured using the Picker Institute&#8217;s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Family Satisfaction survey, was presented in the form of charts (Figures 2 and 3 in the paper) with neither corresponding data labels nor accompanying data figures in the text. This makes data extraction and meta-analysis impossible. The lead author was contacted by e-mail on three occasions with request for provide data, and we are still awaiting a reply</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In the study, 20% of the control group were back-transferred to their local level two nursery while none of the participants in the intervention group was. It was unclear whether this represented a source of selection bias, or indicated possible co-intervention (performance bias), or an indication of the need to retain participants in the study setting for the purpose of the study, leading to unequal care process between some of the infants in the intervention group and the control group (for example, all the infants in the control group were transferred back to their local nursery when deemed appropriate as usual, while infants in the intervention group were retained in the study setting for the purpose of the study despite having fulfilled the criteria for transfer-back to their local nursery), or an important outcome as a direct result of the different assigned intervention. It was impossible to distinguish the various possibilities mainly because of the lack of explanation provided by the authors, including the essential information to enable an assessment of the risks of selection and performance biases. Additionally, transfer-back to the local nursery was not listed a priori as an outcome</P>
