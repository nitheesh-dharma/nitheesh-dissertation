<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-30 18:43:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Young drivers are at high risk of involvement in motor vehicle crashes. Graduated driver licensing (GDL) has been proposed as a means of reducing crash rates among novice drivers by gradually introducing them to higher risk driving situations. This review found 34 studies that have evaluated various types of GDL programs. All of the studies reported positive findings, with reductions for all types of crashes among all teenage drivers. However, the size of the reductions varied and, based on the included studies it is not possible to say which aspects of GDL programs have the biggest effect. Future research on GDL should evaluate the relative impact of different program components.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-08-31 15:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Studies were identified through searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Web of Science, NTIS Bibliographic Database, TRIS Online, SIGLE, the World Wide Web, conference proceedings, consultation with experts and reference lists in relevant published literature. The searches were conducted from the time of inception to May 2009, and the Cochrane Injuries Group conducted an updated search of the TRANSPORT database in September 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Studies were included if: 1) they compared outcomes pre- and post-implementation of a GDL program within the same jurisdiction, 2) comparisons were made between jurisdictions with and without GDL, or 3) both. Studies had to report at least one objective, quantified outcome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Results were not pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Percentage change was calculated for each year after the intervention, using one year prior to the intervention as baseline. Results were adjusted by internal controls. Analyses were stratified by denominators (population, licensed drivers). Results were calculated for the different crash types and presented for 16 year-olds alone as well as all teenage drivers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We included 34 studies evaluating 21 GDL programs and 2 analyses of &gt;40 US states. GDL programs were implemented in the US (n=16), Canada (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), and Australia (n=1) and varied in their restrictions during the intermediate stage. Based on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) classification, eleven programs were good, four were fair, five were marginal, one was poor and two could not be assessed. Reductions in crash rates were seen in all jurisdictions and for all crash types. Among 16 year-old drivers, the median decrease in per population adjusted overall crash rates during the first year was 15.5% (range -27 to -8%, five studies). There was a decrease in per population adjusted injury crash rates (median -21%, range -46 to -2%, five studies). Results for all teenage drivers, rates per licensed driver, and rates adjusting for internal controls were generally reduced when comparing within jurisdictions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>GDL is effective in reducing crash rates among young drivers, although the magnitude of the effect varies. The conclusions are supported by consistent findings, temporal relationship, and plausibility of the association. Stronger GDL programs (i.e. more restrictions or higher quality based on IIHS classification) appear to result in greater fatality reduction. Future studies should focus on which components and combination of components yield the greatest reductions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-31 15:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>It is well recognized that teenagers are more likely to be involved in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) compared to older drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 2000</LINK>). In Canada and the United States, crash rates per mile driven are three to ten times higher among teenage drivers than among the older, more experienced drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 2000</LINK>). MVCs account for 40% of fatalities from all causes among adolescents aged 16 to 19 years (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1996</LINK>). Teenage drivers represent not only a threat to themselves, but to other road users (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). While 15-20 year-olds compose 6.3% of the American population, they are responsible for 12.6% of traffic fatalities (<LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2005</LINK>). A 16 year-old driver's crash rate per mile driven is twice as high as 18-19 year-old drivers and 10 times higher than that of 30-59 year-old drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research suggests that the two most likely factors contributing to this inordinately high risk for crashes among teenage drivers are driving inexperience and immaturity (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1997</LINK>). Lack of driving experience contributes to a lower level of skills and inability to respond effectively under less than optimal conditions (e.g. driving at night and having passengers). Lack of developmental maturity among teenagers can lead to impulsive behavior, poor decision making, overconfidence in their abilities, as well as more risky driving styles, such as speeding, following too closely or dangerous passing (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors for MVCs have traditionally been addressed through licensing (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003</LINK>), education, and enforcement (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1998</LINK>). Driver licensing systems were imposed to "ensure that novices meet certain minimal requirements deemed necessary to operate a motor vehicle safely in traffic" (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003</LINK>). Probationary and provisional licensing programs were precursors to graduated licensing and, like graduated licensing, sought to address the higher crash rates of young drivers. In a review of the literature on the effectiveness and role of driver education, Mayhew and colleagues concluded that the existing evidence did not show that formally trained drivers had lower crash rates (<LINK REF="REF-Mayhew-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayhew 1998</LINK>). In fact, they identified several studies that have shown driver education to be associated with increased crash rates. This could be due to the fact that these programs may place more drivers on the road. Likewise there is no evidence that enforcement on its own mitigates the effects of young driver inexperience on crash rates (<LINK REF="REF-Waller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waller 2003</LINK>).</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Since the 1970s, graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs have been discussed and implemented as a means of controlling the risks and reducing crash rates among young drivers. The basic premise of GDL is that individuals begin driving under relatively safe conditions that involve lower risk, and are gradually introduced to more complex or higher risk driving situations (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayhew-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mayhew 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ideal GDL program has three stages (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). The beginning stage generally requires that an adult with a valid license be present at all times; under GDL this stage should last for an extended, mandatory amount of time. The intermediate stage allows the new driver to drive alone but with certain restrictions (e.g. no night-time driving, limitations on extra passengers, restrictions on blood alcohol concentration - BAC). The final stage is full licensure, whereby the individual is free to drive independently under the usual laws and regulations.</P>
<P>Various organizations have put forward recommendations for GDL, for example: the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Traffic Injury Research Foundation (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>), the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>), and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (<LINK REF="REF-MADD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MADD 2000</LINK>). Based on these recommendations, the key elements appear to be: delayed full-privilege licensure, extended periods of supervised practice driving, and restrictions during the intermediate stage on night driving, BAC (not applicable to all jurisdictions), and extra passengers. The recommendations for individual components within GDL programs are based on empirical evidence of risk factors for crashes involving young, new drivers.</P>
<P>Though GDL programs were first described in the 1970s, they were slow to be accepted and implemented. The number of jurisdictions in North America with full GDL programs has steadily increased since the early 1990s; all states in the United States except North Dakota, and all Canadian provinces and territories except Nunavut, have a full three-stage GDL (<LINK REF="REF-IIHS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIHS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Northwest-Territories-Transportation-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northwest Territories Transportation 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003b</LINK>). The widespread implementation of GDL has provided an opportunity to study their overall effectiveness.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>In 1999, Foss published the results of a systematic review of the effectiveness of GDL in reducing MVCs (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). This review was critically appraised by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) at the University of York, England. The NHS CRD identified the following shortcomings of the review: authors did not report how decisions on inclusion and exclusion of studies were made, how methodological quality was assessed, or how data extraction was done (Foss 199). No overall estimates of effect were calculated, study results were instead described separately. The authors of the review concluded that there was evidence that a restriction on night-time driving reduced crashes among young drivers. The authors stated that they could not make a definitive conclusion about the overall effectiveness of GDL due to insufficient data. At the time of their review only one program (New Zealand) had been evaluated: this program showed positive results with a 7-8% reduction in the rates of teenage driver injury crashes.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to update and expand upon the work begun by Foss et al (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). We also sought to address the shortcomings identified by the NHS CRD by reporting on criteria and methods for inclusion, quality assessment, and data extraction. This version is an update of the original review published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Hartling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartling 2004</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2011-08-16 01:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to issues related to logistics and feasibility, the preponderance of research in this area involves studies with an ecological design. Ecological (or aggregate risk) studies are those in which the intervention of interest (i.e. GDL) is applied across an entire population (<LINK REF="REF-Hingson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hingson 2001</LINK>). Often there is limited or no information on how vigorously the laws are enforced at an individual level. Ecological studies may take a number of forms, for example: studies involving a single population in which outcomes are measured before and after legislation is implemented (before-and-after or pre-post study); studies that compare two or more populations concurrently; and, studies evaluating both within-population outcomes over time and between-population differences (<LINK REF="REF-Hingson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hingson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies were included in the review if: 1) they compared outcomes immediately pre and post-implementation of a GDL program; 2) comparisons were made between similar or adjacent jurisdictions with and without a GDL program; or 3) both.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-08-25 08:46:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Studies evaluating populations with GDL were included in the review. The target population of interest was teenage drivers. While some jurisdictions apply GDL to all novice drivers regardless of age (e.g. Ontario, Canada), only data pertaining to teenage drivers were included. Teenage drivers were defined as drivers younger than 20 years of age.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-16 00:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were considered for inclusion if they evaluated GDL. For the purposes of this review, GDL programs must have a minimum of three stages that allow the new driver to progress from lower to higher risk driving conditions: 1) an initial period limited to supervised driving, 2) an intermediate stage allowing for unsupervised driving under one or more conditions that involve lower risk, and 3) finally unrestricted full licensure (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). Lower-risk conditions during the intermediate stage include: night curfews, limited number of passengers, lower BAC, roadway restrictions, or limitations on the number of violations, convictions, crashes, or demerit points. Any licensing program that did not include an intermediate stage was excluded. Judgment regarding the definition of GDL was based on the information provided in the written report.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The selection of studies involved two steps. First, the initial search results of all databases and reference lists were screened independently by two investigators (original: LH, KR; update: LH, KR, JS, ES) to identify citations with potential relevance. Second, the full text of selected articles was obtained. Two reviewers (original: LH, JP, or KR; update: LH, KR) independently decided on study inclusion, using a standard form with pre-determined eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third party when necessary.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Data were extracted by two investigators (original: KR, NW; update: MK) and checked by a second investigator (original: LH, KR, or NW; update: KR, BV). A standard form was used that described the following: characteristics of the study (e.g. design); target population (age groups); interventions (description of GDL system, timing of intervention, co-interventions); outcomes (types of outcome measures, timing of outcomes); data sources; and, results. There were several studies that examined the same jurisdiction. In general, the primary study was defined as either the most recent study, the peer-reviewed study (opposed to internal document or grey literature), the study with a control group, or the study that examined the greatest span of years. If additional outcomes or different denominators were reported in secondary studies, these outcomes were included. Studies that examined an original and a revised GDL program, respectively, for the same jurisdiction were treated as two studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-27 18:27:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>The assessment of quality for observational studies is an area of ongoing discussion. To our best knowledge, there is only one tool that has been developed and tested for the assessment of methodological quality of both randomized and non-randomized studies (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). This tool does not specifically address ecological studies, and the authors of the tool have recognized that further improvement of the instrument is required. Other researchers have developed scales for the purposes of specific reviews. These have not, however, been validated and are not widely applicable to other topics of study (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Elvik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivara-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivara 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In assessing quality of the component studies, our overriding premise was that ecological studies are among the methodologically weaker study designs. Quality was assessed based on threats to the validity of ecological studies as presented by Hingson (<LINK REF="REF-Hingson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hingson 2001</LINK>):<BR/>

<LI>measurement error: objective versus subjective data sources, e.g. police reports versus self-reports</LI>
<LI>control groups: no control groups, internal controls (within the same jurisdiction, e.g. drivers 25-54), external controls (comparing two different jurisdictions), both internal and external controls</LI>

<P>
<BR/>We also assessed the quality of the GDL program using the Classification of Licensing Systems from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (<LINK REF="REF-IIHS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIHS 2000</LINK>). The IIHS system classifies GDL programs into one of four categories: good, fair (previously referred to as 'acceptable'), marginal, or poor. Criteria for each category are as follows.</P>
<P>Good:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>mandatory learner's permit holding period of at least six months, <I>and</I>
</LI>
<LI>optimal restriction on the initial license: either an optimal night driving restriction (curfew begins before midnight) or an optimal passenger restriction (no extra passengers unless supervised) lasting until age 17.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Fair (previously referred to as 'acceptable'):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>optimal restrictions lasting until age 17 with regard to the learner's holding period (minimum of six months), <I>or</I>
</LI>
<LI>any mandatory learner's holding period and any night driving or passenger restriction (during the intermediate stage) lasting at least until age 16½.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Marginal:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>at least one significant element of graduated licensing. Marginal systems include: (i) both a mandatory learner's holding period that may be less than six months and either a night driving or passenger restriction during the intermediate stage; or (ii) only an optimal mandatory learner's holding period (at least six months); or (iii) any night driving or passenger restriction on the intermediate license.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Poor:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>no mandatory learner's holding period</LI>
<LI>no night driving or passenger restrictions during the intermediate stage, <I>or</I>
</LI>
<LI>mandatory learner's holding period less than six months and no other significant elements of graduated licensing.</LI>
</UL>
<P>GDLs were classified by the IIHS system; this was not used to define GDL but to ascertain the strength of the program. While the IIHS would classify a two-staged licensing program as GDL and define it as either a marginal or poor program, two-stage licensing programs were not included in this review.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (original: LH, NW, update: MK, KR) independently assessed both study quality and program quality. Quality was assessed based on information provided in the written report. For the newly added studies that were conducted in the United States, the IIHS classification was determined from their website which describes each state's GDL program (<LINK REF="REF-IIHS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">IIHS 2011</LINK>). When studies were conducted outside the United States, the above criteria were applied to the study. The criteria could not be applied to the studies that examined the majority of American states. Differences were resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-08-31 15:46:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Percentage change was calculated for each year after the intervention year, using one year prior to the intervention as the baseline rate. Baseline rates were calculated using two denominators based on what was reported in the original study: per 10,000 population or per 10,000 licensed drivers. We did not evaluate the intervention year itself because of fluctuations in licensing rates immediately prior to and following program implementation, and to allow for a minimum amount of time for individuals to progress to the intermediate stage of licensure (<LINK REF="STD-Shope-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shope 2001</LINK>); this is a standard approach in this type of evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Foss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2001</LINK>). There was one exception to this: <LINK REF="STD-Foss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2001</LINK> implemented their program in December of 1997 and omitted 1998 data from their analysis. We analyzed their results accordingly. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Ohio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohio 2001</LINK> provided results for 1999 only. Since the second phase of the intervention was implemented in January 1999 we did not include these results in our analysis.</P>
<P>Percentage changes were either calculated directly from rates or from raw numbers. Some data were extracted from graphs (<LINK REF="STD-Foss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Foss 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Frith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masten-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Masten 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rios-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rios 2006</LINK>), or derived from other summary statistics (<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Frith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shope-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shope 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>). Additional data came from authors (<LINK REF="STD-Agent-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agent 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1983</LINK>) and from an online government source (<LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results from the component studies were not pooled due to statistical heterogeneity and differences among studies with respect to study quality and design, program quality and design, definition of outcomes, baseline rates, and data reported. Percentage change was selected as the summary measure, as it can be compared across studies regardless of baseline rates. Results for the first and last years that were studied post-GDL implementation are presented. (Other post-implementation rates are available from the review authors on request.) As some studies only looked at one year post-implementation, we provided data for one year for all studies to facilitate comparisons across programs. Results were adjusted by internal controls when data were available. A variety of internal control groups was used across the studies (e.g. 18-24, 19+, 20+, 25+, 25-54 year-olds). Only a few studies had relevant, extractable data for external controls, therefore rates adjusted for external controls were not calculated. Results were calculated for teenagers and for 16 year-olds only. Analyses were stratified by the different denominators used for rate calculations in the component studies (i.e. population, number of licensed drivers). Unadjusted results are presented unless otherwise noted. Baseline rates were calculated per 10,000 persons. Results were calculated for the different crash types: overall, injury (fatal and non-fatal), fatal, night-time, alcohol, and those leading to hospitalization. Night-time and alcohol crashes were added as post-hoc outcomes, because they were commonly reported in the component studies.</P>
<P>The following example illustrates the calculation of rates and how these were adjusted for controls. The example uses data from <LINK REF="STD-Mayhew-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mayhew 2000</LINK> for all-cause crashes among 16 year-olds. The baseline rate (BR) was 387 per 10,000 population. The rate one year post-implementation (PR) was 256/10,000. The internal control group (25+) experienced a BR of 238/10,000 and a PR of 207/10,000. Percent changes (PC) were calculated as follows:</P>
<P>PC = ((PR - BR)/BR)*100 = ((256 - 387)/387)*100 = -34%<BR/>
<BR/>Thus, the unadjusted percent change for 16 year-olds is -34%. Percent change for the internal controls is ((207-238)/238 * 100) = -13%. The adjusted percent changes were calculated as follows:</P>
<P>PC<SUB>adj</SUB> = PC<SUB>unadj</SUB> - PC<SUB>25+</SUB> = -34 - (-13) = -34 + 13 = -21<BR/>
<BR/>Thus, the adjusted percent change for 16 year-olds is -21%.</P>

<P>Unadjusted and adjusted percent changes in rates of overall, injury, hospitalized, fatal, night-time, and alcohol crashes are provided in the Additional Tables. The two columns labelled "unadj % chge yr 1" and "adj % change yr 1" compare changes between the first year after program implementation to the last year prior to the year of implementation. The columns labelled "unadj % chge last yr" and "adj % change last yr" reflect changes between the last year evaluated post-implementation and the last year prior to implementation. Caution should be exercised when comparing results across jurisdictions. The use of percent change allows for comparisons regardless of differences in baseline rates. However, there are many factors that may account for the results; such as the program itself, the laws that existed pre-GDL, the level of enforcement and compliance with the restrictions, and the study methodology.</P>

<P>Data were presented on alcohol-related crashes (<LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>) for four jurisdictions with zero tolerance for BAC. For 16 year-olds, two studies provided per population reductions: 16% (adjusted 2%) and 38% for the first year post-GDL. Rates in other years post-implementation were similar. <LINK REF="STD-Shope-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shope 2001</LINK> noted that the lack of substantial change in alcohol-related crashes over the three years studied was likely due to the zero tolerance law that was instituted prior to the study period. For all teenage novice drivers, <LINK REF="STD-Boase-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boase 1998</LINK> found a rate reduction per licensed driver of 19%. <LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 2000</LINK> evaluated the change in number of victims killed or injured in night-time single-vehicle crashes (21:00-06:00) as a proxy for alcohol-related crashes. Among learner and probationary drivers, the numbers decreased by 12% for two years post-GDL versus two years pre-GDL. There was a net decrease of 9% when adjusting for the 18-24 year-old internal control group. The authors considered these results to be preliminary as the outcome is not a perfect proxy for alcohol-related crashes.</P>
<P>Two additional studies presented data on alcohol-related crashes but the jurisdictions did not have zero tolerance for BAC: these had BAC restrictions of 0.02 (<LINK REF="STD-Agent-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agent 2001</LINK>) and 0.03 mg/dl (<LINK REF="STD-Frith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Frith 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Agent-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agent 2001</LINK> found a per licensed driver rate reduction of 39% for 16 year-olds; this was similar two and three years post-GDL. Among 16-19 year-old drivers, he showed an increase per licensed driver of 15% in the first year post-GDL and zero and 4% decrease in the subsequent years post-GDL. <LINK REF="STD-Frith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Frith 1992</LINK> presented data on the degree of compliance with GDL restrictions, by comparing crash rates between 15-19 year-old drivers on a full or restricted license over a three year period post-GDL (1988-1990): drivers with a restricted license had 23% fewer crashes where alcohol-involvement was suspected.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 2007</LINK> used a time series analysis to calculate crash rates among 16 year-old drivers driving with teen passengers in California, Massachusetts, and Maryland and their matched control state. After the California law change, there was a near significant reduction in crashes among 16 year-olds driving with young passengers and this resulted in crash reduction of 6/100,000 population. For Massachusetts two-vehicle crashes, it was not possible to determine which car the teen passenger was riding in. However, there was a significant reduction in single vehicle crashes driven by 16 year-old drivers with passengers (13/100,000 population per month). Virginia GDL allowed 16 year-old drivers to drive with only one passenger younger than 18 years of age. After the law change, there were significantly fewer 16 year-old drivers involved in crashes carrying two or more passengers (2.9/100,000 population per month).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK> calculated the injury rate for teen passengers (15-19) who were injured or killed while riding with 16 year-old drivers. During the first year post-GDL, the rate per licensed driver decreased by only 3%. During the second year post-GDL, the observed decrease was 23%. Likewise, the passenger injury rate per population did not change substantially during the first year post-GDL (11% reduction), but did decrease significantly two years post-GDL (41%). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK> concluded that the reductions show there was compliance with the passenger restriction.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons of denominators and age groups used</HEADING>
<P>When comparing results for different denominators and age groups, only within jurisdiction (direct) comparisons have value because there are too many other confounders between studies.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Overall, the evidence indicates that GDL is effective in reducing crash rates of teenage drivers, although the magnitude of the reduction varies. Several of the Bradford Hill criteria of causality were met (<LINK REF="REF-Bradford-Hill-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradford Hill 1965</LINK>). First, there was a clear temporal relationship between the implementation of GDL programs and observed reductions. Second, the results were consistent: reductions were seen for all types of crashes among 16 year-olds and all teenage drivers, although the impact varied across jurisdictions. The effectiveness of GDL is supported by reductions in rates of all crash types and (almost entirely) consistent positive results across studies and within studies when adjusting for internal controls. Third, it is plausible that reducing driver exposure to high-risk situations would reduce crash rates. These findings are strengthened by studies conducted in the US that simultaneously examined the effectiveness of GDL programs in 43 (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2006</LINK>) or 48 (<LINK REF="STD-Dee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dee 2005</LINK>) states. The four studies found a reduction in fatal crashes among 16 year old drivers and all teenage drivers, regardless of denominator choice (i.e. population based or licensed drivers). While the results from across the studies were consistent, the majority of the studies were conducted in the US or Canada. The results and conclusions of this review may not be generalizable to other countries where licenses are purchased instead of earned or where the age of licensure differs.</P>
<P>While the principles underlying GDL are widely accepted, there is variability in the design and strength of different programs (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003a</LINK>). Because of the political realities and different social environments, the programs accepted for implementation will vary. For example, jurisdictions with many rural communities may be reluctant to adopt an early night curfew that limits teenagers' ability to work or participate in school events. We hypothesized a priori that there may be a variation in effect between programs with more versus fewer components (e.g. dose-response relationship). We were unable to find any consistent patterns when examining the results by the quality of the GDL program; however, two unique recent studies from the US found that stronger GDL programs (either containing more restrictions or rated as 'good' by the IIHS) resulted in significantly fewer fatalities. Despite the structure of the programs, the research shows that all appear to be having positive effects.</P>
<P>GDL programs are continually evolving. For example, Maryland has strengthened their program by increasing the minimum holding time within each stage and added a passenger restriction. California increased the duration of night-time restriction from 00:00 to 23:00. The revised GDL programs allow for the unique opportunity to examine different components within the program within the same jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Due to issues related to logistics and feasibility, research in this area involves studies with an ecological design. A specific concern affecting the validity of results from ecological studies is the inability to fully control for other explanatory factors. For example, authors have questioned the extent to which the effects are attributable to GDL or to delayed licensure or reduced exposure (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Agent-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agent 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Frith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>). One of the simpler methods of controlling for changes in licensing is through comparison of rates based on the number of licensed drivers. There were six studies for which we had both population and licensed driver denominators for the same outcome. Among these studies, the changes were consistently smaller when using licensed drivers as the denominator. Readers should be aware of this when examining the results from different studies. While both denominators are valid and important, they are answering slightly different questions. Rates per licensed drivers demonstrate the direct effects of GDL legislation (<LINK REF="STD-Ohio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohio 2001</LINK>). Whereas population-based rates also capture the indirect effects of the legislation, such as driving exposure.</P>
<P>Many studies have attempted to control for other factors through the use of control groups and appropriate statistical techniques. As seen from the results presented in the tables, the calculations adjusting for internal controls are generally lower than the unadjusted values. Therefore, unadjusted values may overestimate the impact of the program. Internal controls are used to control for extraneous variables within the population under study that may explain the observed effects (e.g. other traffic safety legislation), while external controls will take into account variables acting at a regional level that are not related to graduated licensing (e.g. economic factors affecting the larger geographic area as a whole) (<LINK REF="STD-Agent-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Agent 2001</LINK>). While many of the studies attempted to control for important potential confounders, the role of some potential confounders has not been explored and may not be feasible. For example, the effects of road networking, speed limits, resources for patrolling the roads, and differences in road and safety culture have not been determined.</P>
<P>A limitation of some of the studies was the relatively short period of time evaluated post-intervention. Often there were dramatic increases in licensing rates immediately before the implementation of a program with a concomitant decrease immediately after. Studies with short follow-up periods may be reporting misleading findings. Calculation of collision rates per licensed drivers controls for changes in licensing. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up is essential in order to allow patterns to stabilize and to evaluate the full impact of a program. In addition, changes seen post-implementation may simply reflect the continuation of a pre-existing downward trend (<LINK REF="STD-Mayhew-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mayhew 2000</LINK>). Specific analytic techniques (e.g. time series analyses) can account for the confounding effects of trends over time. A minimum of three years pre and post-intervention is required for statistical analyses to be feasible. A minimum of three years would also allow for the first full cohort to have completed the program. A number of studies conducted time series or other analyses that control for time trends and the results were generally conservative compared with the range of findings reported overall. A second limitation is that the population distributions within each jurisdiction were not standardized but the actual population. If the population structures differ, this will not be adjusted for in the calculation of the population based injury rates.</P>
<P>This review found that certain components (e.g. night-time curfews) showed a positive effect; however, we cannot directly compare programs with and without these specific components because of other confounders. It is of interest that the programs vary with respect to key elements that are empirically supported in the literature. For example, the evidence demonstrates that night curfews are effective in reducing crash rates; previous research has suggested that the optimal starting time is 21:00 or 22:00 (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1999</LINK>). Despite this evidence, only seventeen of the twenty-three programs had a night curfew during the intermediate phase and only three of the curfews began before midnight for all drivers. There is also evidence supporting restrictions on the number of passengers (<LINK REF="REF-Aldridge-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldridge 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preusser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preusser 1998</LINK>). However, eleven programs did not allow passengers when driving unsupervised during the intermediate stage. In contrast, driver's education has been shown to have few benefits in terms of reducing crash rates (<LINK REF="REF-Mayhew-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayhew 1998</LINK>). It is, however, an essential component in seven programs and in four programs minimum holding periods can be reduced with successful completion. In addition to identifying the individual GDL components that result in the greatest reduction of injuries, it is optimal to identify the chain or process of how injuries are reduced. For example, a strong GDL program may be ineffective without adequate and consistent enforcement. The studies did not provide adequate details to examine these process factors.</P>
<P>While it is desirable for a systematic review to provide an overall summary measure of the estimates of effect, it is not always appropriate. Meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in study populations (baseline rates, population sizes, age groups), methods (e.g. denominators used in rate calculations), outcomes (e.g. different definitions, different reporting thresholds), and the interventions (the programs themselves, other legislative changes, pre-existing legislation, and the extent of enforcement and compliance). Caution should be exercised when comparing results across studies because of the many factors that could influence crash rates. In order to compare study results for different programs, standard methods should be adopted for the evaluation of GDL. We are beginning to see this in the more recent literature as similar methods are being employed from one evaluation to the next. Despite the standardization of methods, the appropriateness of combining data from observational studies remains controversial. Finally, interpretation of study findings should account for the quality, or internal validity, of the study. Presently there are few validated instruments available for the assessment of methodological quality of observational studies and none to our best knowledge that specifically address ecological studies. In order to synthesize available evidence and interpret it in a judicious manner, there is a need to develop a valid tool to assess quality of different types of observational studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The existing evidence indicates that GDL, in its many forms, is effective in reducing crash rates of teenage drivers. The resulting savings in terms of lives and costs are indisputable. The relative contribution of different provisions within a GDL program remains uncertain but has been identified as a research priority in this area (<LINK REF="STD-Hedlund-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hedlund 2003</LINK>) and would benefit from systematic review. The individual provisions may be less important than the overriding principle of gradually introducing new drivers to higher risk situations as they acquire more driving experience. Standard approaches to research methods and reporting would allow for a more equitable comparison of the relative impact of different GDL programs.</P>
