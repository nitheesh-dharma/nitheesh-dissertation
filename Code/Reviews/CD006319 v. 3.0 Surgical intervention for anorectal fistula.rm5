<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:06:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anorectal fistula is a common surgical problem. The anorectal fistula can be treated by various surgical options. The common surgical options for rectal fistulae are <BR/>a) to lay open the fistula tract (fistulotomy), or<BR/>b) to pass a seton (a thread, wire or tube that stimulates the body to extrude it and ultimately heal the fistula), or <BR/>c) to primarily remove the fistula (fistulectomy) and repair the defect in the muscle and the anus with an anorectal myo-mucosal advancement flap. <BR/>Other treatment modalities used less frequently include fibrin glue and ayurvedic drugs incorporated into setons. The optimal surgical treatment for anorectal fistulae is associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and a good quality of life.</P>
<P>The reviewers identified 10 trials that compare various fistula treatments against one another. There are various parameters that these procedures can be compared on, but we looked at the two most important ones, recurrence (the numbers who got the disease again) and incontinence (a worsening in the ability to control rectal content).</P>
<P>In the trials that were compared, there was no significant difference between the various comparisons for the disease to recur. However the trials on fibrin glue, as well as data from non randomised trials show that incontinence is less, probably as there is no surgical disruption of the anal muscle.</P>
<P>There is a paucity of good quality data that compares various types of operative treatment for anorectal fistula and there is scope for further trials in the area.</P>

<P>Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-13 17:06:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non-randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-13 17:22:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned.</P>
<P>The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. </P>
<P>There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:11:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anorectal fistulae are common and surgical treatment may not always cure the fistula, resulting in recurrence, and may also result in some impairment of continence (soiling, flatus incontinence, urgency or leakage, especially with loose stools). Recurrence risks range from less than 10% to as high as 57 % (<LINK REF="REF-Keighley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keighley 1993</LINK>). Repeated operations may result in incontinence. Primary anorectal fistulae are usually a result of anorectal (crypto glandular) sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Keighley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keighley 1993</LINK>). However they may arise due to secondary causes such as malignancy, tuberculosis, hydradenitis suppurativa and Crohn's disease. There are a variety of surgical options available for treatment; however the rationale for choosing each is poorly defined.</P>
<P>The common surgical options for rectal fistulae are a) to lay open the fistula tract (fistulotomy), b) to pass a seton (a thread, wire or tube that stimulates the body to extrude it and ultimately heal the fistula) or c) to primarily remove the fistula (fistulectomy) and repair the defect in the muscle and the anus with an anorectal myo- mucosal advancement flap (<LINK REF="REF-Keighley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keighley 1993</LINK>). Other treatment modalities used less frequently include fibrin glue and ayurvedic drugs incorporated into the setons (<LINK REF="STD-ICMR-1991" TYPE="STUDY">ICMR 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anorectal fistulae are classified based on their anatomy in relation to the internal anal sphincter, the external anal sphincter and the puborectalis, defining the internal and external opening of each tract, the presence of high blind tracts, the number of fistulae and the presence of active sepsis within the site of the cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Parks-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 1976</LINK>). Anorectal fistulae can be broadly classified into high fistula in ano if the tract traverses the levator ani and low fistula in ano if it does not. Thus, surgical intervention will differ according to the type of fistula (<LINK REF="REF-Mylonakis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mylonakis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorge-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorge 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The optimal surgical treatment for anorectal fistulae would be one that is associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and a good quality of life.</P>
<P>There are very few well conducted trials comparing various modes of treatment for fistula in ano, assessing recurrence and incontinence. The evidence, therefore, is not clear and hence the importance of this review.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:27:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently screened all citations and abstracts identified by the search to identify potentially eligible trials. Full articles of potentially eligible trials were obtained and independently evaluated for inclusion in the review based on the inclusion criteria. We were not blinded to the report authors, journals, date of publication, and sources of financial support or results. Reasons for exclusion are described in Characteristics of excluded studies.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-04-14 10:35:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data from the included studies onto pre-tested data extraction forms.</P>
<P>The following pre-specified characteristics of all included trials were extracted by two reviewers (TJ, BP) independently:</P>
<P>Methods: Randomisation procedure, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, sample size calculation, and length of follow-up.<BR/>Participants: Classification of disease (low or high fistulae), number randomised, number completing follow up and reasons for withdrawal from the study were analysed.<BR/>Interventions: Fistulotomy, fistulectomy, Myo - mucosal advancement flap, fibrin glue,radiofrequency abalation, setons(cutting or loose) were analysed.<BR/>Outcomes: Efficacy - a)Recurrence - and at what time frame in each intervention. Morbidity - b) Anal functional disturbance (incontinence).</P>
<P>Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors of the trial.<BR/>Outcomes.<BR/>Where binary outcomes (proportions) were used, we calculated relative risks (RR), fixed and confidence intervals for each outcome. In addition we calculated absolute measures, the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH)<I>.</I> We undertook analysis on an intention to treat basis.<BR/>None of the included trials included continuous data, but we would have excluded continuous data if more than 20% of people were lost to follow up. We would have reported continuous data as presented in the original studies without making any assumptions about those lost to follow up. For continuous outcomes, we would have calculated pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) and confidence intervals for outcomes using similar measures.</P>
<P>Data on continuous outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, all data included in the review would have had to meet the following criteria:<BR/>i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors;<BR/>ii. when a scale started from 0 the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution)<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>).<BR/>iii. if a scale started from a positive value the calculation described above in ii) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness was considered present if 2SD&gt;(S-S<SUB>min</SUB>), where S is the mean score and S<SUB>min</SUB> is the minimum score.</P>
<P>Data that did not meet these standards would not have been entered into the RevMan software (which assumes a normal distribution). However, we would have reported data not meeting these criteria in additional tables and in the text if they had been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests.</P>
<P>Where possible we presented endpoint data, and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then we reported only the former.</P>
<P>The onset of the follow up period for patients with seton placement was assumed as the time the seton was removed or fell out. Patients with setons in situ were considered incompletely treated.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-19 08:12:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of bias was assessed using the tool provided by Revman 5.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (TJ and BP) assessed the risk of bias in the included trial reports. We assessed the following six components for each of the trials: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases.</P>
<P>Generation of the allocation sequence:</P>
<P>Adequate: table of random numbers, computer generated random numbers or similar.<BR/>Unclear: the trial was described as randomised, but the generation of the allocation sequence was not described.<BR/>Inadequate: quasi-randomised trials.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Adequate: concealed up to the point of treatment by central randomisation, sealed envelopes or similar.<BR/>Unclear: the allocation concealment was not described.<BR/>Inadequate: open table of random numbers or similar.</P>
<P>We attempted to contact the trial authors for clarifications if any of the six components are unclear or not stated in the report. We summarized the findings as a 'risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>We used these assessments for sensitivity analysis and not as exclusion criteria.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-19 08:15:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If outcomes had included data from five or more trials, we would have entered data into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-11-19 08:08:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Had data been available in the included trials, we would have analysed data using subgroups based on duration of follow up less or more than six months as we anticipated different rates of incontinence and recurrence, depending on the duration of follow up.</P>
<P>After considering the likelihood of clinical heterogeneity based on comparisons of the included studies, we supplemented graphical display of results with the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test of heterogeneity to check whether differences in results were due to chance alone. Since this test has low power to detect heterogeneity, we interpreted a significance level less than 0.10 as evidence of heterogeneity. In addition, we quantified inconsistency across studies and its impact on the meta-analysis by examining the value of I-squared to estimate the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. We interpreted an I-squared value of 50% or greater as indicating substantial levels of heterogeneity<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).<B> </B>Had heterogeneity been detected but not quantified as contributing substantially to variation in data, all data would have been pooled and interpreted using the random-effects model. Had inconsistency been substantial, data from the responsible studies would not have been pooled and the results would have been presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity explored. If substantial heterogeneity had been present, we would have undertaken a sensitivity analysis to the presence or absence of these data.</P>

<P>Our electronic search strategy identified 186 studies. Ten randomized controlled trials were considered for the meta analysis. Fifteen case series were listed for a narrative synthesis of primary outcome of recurrence and secondary outcome of incontinence. Twelve studies were excluded based on the criteria stated in the protocol, which included high attrition rates (<LINK REF="REF-ICMR-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICMR 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerterp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Westerterp 2002</LINK>), and inappropriate study population with complex fistula in ano (<LINK REF="STD-Abel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Abel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mc-Courtney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mc Courtney 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olmo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Olmo 2009</LINK>). We shall include the trials excluded due to high attrition in future updates of this review should we obtain usable data on missing outcomes from the trial authors. Two reports did include non complex crypto glandular fistulae, but the required data could not be extracted from the studies or tables provided (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Hagen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Hagen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venkatesh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Venkatesh 1999</LINK>). One study assessed an incontinence score (FISI- fecal incontinence severity index) after fistulotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Cavanaugh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cavanaugh 2002</LINK>). Another compared 3 variations of Fibrin glue injections (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2005</LINK> ).<BR/>An online search of the Indian Journal of Surgery revealed 1 study (<LINK REF="STD-Mangual-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mangual 2004</LINK>) that was excluded because there was no intervention used and the authors defined 60 % of their cases as sinuses as they had no demonstrable internal opening. Our INDMED search revealed one study (<LINK REF="STD-Oak-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oak 2004</LINK>), that was excluded as it was a paediatric case report.<BR/>In our search we found multiple publications by a single author on radiofrequency fistulotomy. The author was contacted and the only randomized controlled study was included for the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK>), and the largest case series was analysed for primary outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004</LINK>).<BR/>In one study where data was unclear, the author provided details on primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>).<BR/>One large randomized controlled trial had included patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsey 2002</LINK>). Inspite of our protocol stating that such studies would be excluded, this study was included for meta analysis, since the absolute numbers of patients with Crohn's Disease was small (less than 20 % further subdivided into sub groups). The author was contacted and requested to provide data excluding the Crohn's patients. The data is still awaited.<BR/>There were 5 ongoing trials on fistula in ano in the United States (www.clinical trials.gov). Three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2007</LINK>) have been included in our table of ongoing trials. Of these 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2007</LINK>) is comparing collagen plug to cutting seton and another collagen plug to advancement flap. (<LINK REF="STD-Schwandner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schwandner 2007</LINK>). The third (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2007</LINK>) is a safety and efficacy study on the collagen plug. All primary trial registers were searched. No other proposed or ongoing trials were found.<BR/>Six studies had follow up for more than six months. Two studies had follow up for less than six months (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>), One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>) had data on incontinence that was assessed at 54 days.<BR/>Although our protocol did not state radiofrequency ablation as one of the interventions to be studied, our search revealed two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK> ) that used radiofrequency ablation for fistula in ano. They were included in the meta analysis as they assessed this modality against conventional surgery.</P>

<P>In the randomized controlled trials, there was no mention of the method of randomization generation in 8 out of 10 studies. However, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zbar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zbar 2003</LINK>) had used random numbers. Seven studies used sealed envelopes, opened just before or during the operation in 4 of them. There is no mention of blinding of the assessor of outcomes in any of the studies. We felt this would not affect our outcome measures.<BR/>There were 3 protocol violations in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>) and no attrition was implied in the remaining 9 studies. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK> ) one patient was lost to follow up in each group.

<P>1. Randomized Controlled trials.</P>
<P>1.1 Radiofrequency compared with conventional fistula surgery. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK>) compared radiofrequency fistulotomy with conventional fistulotomy.<BR/>1.1.1 - Recurrence - When recurrence rates were compared, there was no overall difference between the 2 interventions in both the studies. (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.48; N=122; 2 RCT's)<BR/>1.1.2 - Incontinence - Incontinence rates between the 2 interventions in these 2 studies also showed no significant difference. (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.14 to 1.41; N = 122; 2 RCT's)</P>
<P>1.2 - Ayurvedic seton compared to conventional fistulotomy. There was only one study comparing Ayurvedic (chemical) seton and conventional fistulotomy that met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>). Another large study from India (<LINK REF="STD-ICMR-1991" TYPE="STUDY">ICMR 1991</LINK>) was excluded despite useful data on recurrence and incontinence because more than 20% (40%)of patients were lost to follow up.<BR/>1.2.1 - Recurrence - No recurrences were seen in those treated with ayurvedic seton and one recurrence was noted in those treated with conventional fistulotomy over the two months of follow up.

<P>1.3 -Fibrin glue compared to conventional fistulotomy / seton (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>). This study included simple as well as complex fistulae. We analysed the simple fistulae alone, as data was available separately for this group.<BR/>1.3.1 - Simple fistulae .<BR/>1.3.1.1 Recurrence - All recurrences were in the Fibrin glue intervention. The study therefore favoured conventional fistulotomy (OR 15.0, 95 % CI 0.60 to 376.7; N = 13; 1 RCT)<BR/>1.3.1.2 Incontinence - There was no incontinence in either intervention. Therefore no comparisons could be made.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:38:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review evaluated available randomised controlled trials and observational studies of interventions used to treat simple anal fistulae.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Randomized controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>Ten randomised controlled trials were available for comparison and a total of 18 trials met selection criteria for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. The included trials compared various modalities of therapy and these were assessed separately. Most comparisons included only one trial, except the comparison between radiofrequency fistulotomy and conventional fistulotomy and between marsupialisation after fistulotomy and no marsupialisation, where there were two trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Radiofrequency compared with conventional fistula surgery</HEADING>
<P>There is little literature in the English language on radiofrequency fistulotomy. Its popularity is unknown. In this technique, radio waves are used as the energy source to provide cutting and coagulation facilities at about 80 degree Centigrade. The purported advantages are less bleeding, less pain and quicker recovery. <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK> compared radiofrequency fistulotomy with fistulotomy using a knife. Most workers use a diathermy electrode, as did the second trial in this comparison<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK>). <B>
<BR/>
</B>Pooled analysis of the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK>), comprising 122 patients, showed no difference between the modalities in recurrence rates. It is interesting to note that the results of the trials were divergent, with<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK>
<B> </B>showing a non-significantly lower recurrence rate in favour of radiofrequency and Filingeri's study showing a non-significantly higher recurrence rate with radiofrequency fistulotomy.The pooled results may suggest equivalence, but this needs to be evaluated in a trial sufficiently powered to detect equivalence between the two interventions.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>The incidence of incontinence in<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Filingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filingeri 2004</LINK> (41%) was unusually high. The pooled analysis of both trials did not reveal significant difference in incontinence rates between the two techniques. Both trials had adequate follow up periods (18 and 6 months respectively).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chemical Setons</HEADING>
<P>Chemical setons have been used in the Indian Subcontinent for centuries. Their use was tested in a randomised fashion in a large multicentre trial conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (<LINK REF="STD-ICMR-1991" TYPE="STUDY">ICMR 1991</LINK>). Unfortunately this trial had a large drop out rate (205 out of 502 patients) and did not meet our criteria for inclusion, though we hope to include this trial in updates of this review should our attempts to obtain data from the trial authors prove successful. Only one study qualified for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>). One hundred patients were studied and followed up for a duration of only 68 days.There were no recurrences among 46 patients in the chemical seton group, while one patient out of 54 in the conventional group developed a recurrence in a secondary (missed) tract.<BR/>There were five instances of incontinence from 46 participants in the chemical seton group. This is an unusual finding, in that setons are usually inserted to avoid incontinence. The reason for the increased incontinence rates are not clear. The reasons could include short follow up and possible chemical injury to the sphincter. However, analysis did not reveal significant difference in recurrence or incontinence rates between the two techniques.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fibrin Glue</HEADING>
<P>Fibrin glue (commercial and autologous) injection as treatment of fistulae in ano has attractive potential benefits. One would expect incontinence rates to be low or non existent. The last decade saw numerous studies (<LINK REF="STD-Salim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cintron-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cintron 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2002</LINK>) using fibrin glue to treat complex, high, or recurrent fistulae. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>) was randomised, comparing the use of Fibrin glue to fistulotomy or seton. This complicated study was well conducted and included 13 patients with simple fistulae. Follow up was for 12 weeks and protocol violations were reported.The study did not strictly meet our inclusion criteria, in that the study included complex and Crohn's fistulae. The number of patients with Crohn's disease was small (six patients) and data was available separately for simple fistulae, hence it was included for analysis. The author has been contacted for details on patients with Crohn's disease.<BR/>When recurrence rates for simple fistulae were compared, there were more recurrences in the fibrin glue group. This, however was not statistically significant. Incontinence was not seen in either arm in simple fistulae in this study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">IAS preserving seton</HEADING>
<P>Most workers believe that the Internal Anal Sphincter(IAS) plays only a minor role in continence.<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Zbar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zbar 2003</LINK> described an IAS preserving technique for seton insertion and compared this technique to conventional fistulotomy. He studied 34 patients with a median follow up for one year.There was no significant difference between the two techniques as far as recurrence and incontinence was concerned. Incontinence rates were not less with the IAS preserving technique.The technique appears cumbersome and has no evidence to support its use.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Marsupialisation of fistulotomy</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1998</LINK>
<B> </B>and <LINK REF="STD-Pescatori-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pescatori 2006</LINK> compared conventional fistulotomy to a marsupialization technique where the edges of the fistulotomy wound were sutured to the wound itself. As far as recurrence and incontinence go, there is little to choose from either of these techniques. The authors claim bleeding and healing times are less when marsupialisation is done.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Advancement flaps</HEADING>
<P>Another technique that avoids cutting sphincter is the use of advancement flaps. We could find no study comparing advancement flaps with conventional fistulotomy.<BR/>One study<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 2006</LINK>)<B> </B>compared the advancement flap technique to the flap combined with Fibrin Glue.The combining of advancement flap with Fibrin glue is unusual. According to the authors, a previous series by Zmora (<LINK REF="STD-Zmora-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zmora 2003</LINK>) suggested that the combination resulted in better healing rates( 54% vs 33%).<BR/>As far as recurrence was concerned, there were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. As might be expected, there was no incontinence in either group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Island flap anoplasty</HEADING>
<P>Island flap anoplasty is a technique that involves advancing a cutaneous flap into the rectum. <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK> compared this technique to conventional fistulotomy. In his hands, there was no recurrence or incontinence in any patient. The study recruited only 20 patients, citing the rarity of transsphincteric fistulae as the reason for the small numbers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Khafagy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Khafagy 2001</LINK> compared fibrin glue injection with conventional fistulotomy, but in a non randomised fashion. Sixty patients were divided into two groups. His study showed no difference in recurrence rates in the two groups. All incontinence was in the fistulotomy group, bit this was not a significant difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fistulectomy</HEADING>
<P>Although practised by many surgeons, we found only one old study comparing fistulectomy with fistulotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Kronborg-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kronborg 1985</LINK>). Again, this failed to show any advantage for either technique as far as recurrence and incontinence are concerned.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>One systematic review assessing the role of fibrin glue in the treatment of fistula in ano was identified (<LINK REF="REF-Hammond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 2004</LINK>). Two randomised trials were identified by these authors: (<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>) and a poster abstract by Singer and group, later published (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2005</LINK>). The latter study was not included in our review because it did not compare fibrin glue to conventional treatment. No meta analysis was possible and heterogeneity of studies made direct comparisons difficult in the retrospective studies analysed. The overall recurrence rate varied from 0% to 100%. The reasons for this wide range are many: the aetiology and complexity of the fistula, operative technique, and factors related to the glue itself.<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Swinscoe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swinscoe 2005</LINK> reports a recurrence rate of 53% with the use of fibrin glue( range 10%-78%).There was no reported incontinence following treatment with fibrin glue.</P>
<P>Almost all studies report higher healing rates in simple fistulae, except for<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Lindsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindsey 2002</LINK>, who reported better healing with fibrin glue in complex fistula. However, the recurrence rate of 78% in the conventionally treated group in this study is unusually high.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review on surgical management of anal fistulae (<LINK REF="REF-Malik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malik 2008</LINK>) has conclusions similar to ours and states that major gaps remain in our understanding of anal fistula surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple publications</HEADING>
<P>We encountered one author who has multiple publications of a series of cases treated by radiofrequency ablation (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004</LINK>). Only one RCT by this author has been included for analysis.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-12 18:19:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-04-12 18:16:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The fact that numerous techniques are used to treat fistulae in ano implies that no single technique is satisfactory. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the two major complications that ensue after surgical treatment. Surgical practice varies across centres and this review is an attempt to find evidence to direct therapy. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. Proponents for radiofrequency fistulotomy claim shorter recovery times, less bleeding and less post operative pain with the technique. We did not study these outcomes specifically. A larger trial could possibly assess these outcomes in addition to recurrence and incontinence. While almost all facilities will have diathermy, radiofrequency generators are not universally available and the additional investment may not be justifiable. Again, a larger trial, comparing radiofrequency fistulotomy with diathermy fistulotomy is warranted. The calculated sample size for equivalence for incontinence would be 154 patients and for recurrence would be 170 patients with an equivalence limit &lt;=5%, , power = 80%, and alpha error =5%.
<BR/>
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. Fibrin glue is expensive and may not be an option for resource poor areas. Autologous Fibrin glue preparation requires advanced blood banking facilities and is a cumbersome process, precluding its widespread use. Flaps, though widely practised, also have high recurrence rates, though incontinence rates are low with this technique.</P>
<P>The evidence is not yet out as regards the anal fistula plug, though it is a theoretically an attractive proposition. While incontinence rates in non randomised studies are low, recurrence rates are, at best, comparable to other techniques. The cost of these plugs needs to be justified when recurrence rates are high.</P>
<P>Thus, untill further evidence is available, no specific recommendations can be made as to the ideal treatment for anal fistula.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-12 18:19:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ideal treatment for fistula in ano has not yet been elucidated. There is surprisingly little good evidence, as shown in this review to support any one form of treatment. On the other hand one of the RCTS compares the mode of energy used for fistulotomy with the knife, a rather inconsequential comparison.Therefore, there is an urgent need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Possible comparisons are: conventional fistulotomy vs fistulectomy, conventional fistulotomy vs seton alone and conventional fistulotomy vs Fibrin glue. In spite of the extensive work done in the USA with Fibrin glue, there is only one RCT from Oxford comparing Fibrin glue with conventional treatment. In the recent past, newer techniques like the anal fistula plug and the Ligation of the Intersphincteric Tract (LIFT) have been described. None have been compared with existing techniques in a randomised manner. The results of the PLUG trial are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Slors-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Slors 2007</LINK>). The use of stem cells and collagen matrixes needs further study and comparison with existing techniques.The review also highlights the fact that there are no publications at all on techniques that are widely practised, like oversewing of the internal opening.</P>
