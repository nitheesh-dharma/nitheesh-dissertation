<P>Erythropoietin, a hormone, may help to treat women who develop anaemia after giving birth, but there may be rare adverse events.</P>
<P>Women with anaemia after childbirth may feel tired and breathless and are at risk of infection. Traditional treatments include iron supplementation and blood transfusion for severe anaemia. A hormone, erythropoietin, may help improve iron levels in the blood and the woman's ability to lactate. However, rare adverse events (damage to red blood cells) have been reported. No studies examined the effects of oral iron supplementation alone, the most common treatment for this type of anaemia, or blood transfusions as treatments for women with anaemia after childbirth. More research, particularly of simple interventions such as oral iron supplementation, is required.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:59:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Postpartum anaemia is associated with breathlessness, tiredness, palpitations and maternal infections. Blood transfusions or iron supplementation have been used in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Recently other anaemia treatments, in particular erythropoietin therapy, have also been used. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the clinical effects of treatments for postpartum anaemia, including oral, intravenous or subcutaneous iron/folate supplementation and erythropoietin administration, and blood transfusion.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 12:59:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), Current Contents and ACP Journal Club (from inception to March 2003). We updated this search on 7 June 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapy for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia (oral, intravenous or subcutaneous administration of iron, folate, erythropoietin or blood transfusion) with placebo, another treatment or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:53:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Six included RCTs involving 411 women described treatment with erythropoietin or iron as their primary interventions. No RCTs were identified that assessed treatment with blood transfusion. Few outcomes relating to clinical maternal and neonatal factors were reported: studies focused largely on surrogate outcomes such as haematological indices. Overall, the methodological quality of the included RCTs was reasonable; however, their usefulness in this review is restricted by the interventions and outcomes reported.</P>
<P>When compared with iron therapy only, erythropoietin increased the likelihood of lactation at discharge from hospital (1 RCT, n = 40; relative risk (RR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.98). No apparent effect on need for blood transfusions was found, when erythropoietin plus iron was compared to treatment with iron only (2 RCTs, n = 100; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.92), although the RCTs may have been of insufficient size to rule out important clinical differences. Haematological indices (haemoglobin and haemocrit) showed some increases when erythropoietin was compared to iron only, iron and folate, but not when compared with placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:49:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is some limited evidence of favourable outcomes for treatment of postpartum anaemia with erythropoietin. However, most of the available literature focuses on laboratory haematological indices, rather than clinical outcomes. Further high-quality trials assessing the treatment of postpartum anaemia with iron supplementation and blood transfusions are required. Future trials may also examine the significance of the severity of anaemia in relation to treatment, and an iron-rich diet as an intervention.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 13:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Anaemia after the birth of a baby (postpartum anaemia) is a common problem throughout the world and for most women is self limiting, resolving within a week (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 1994</LINK>). For some women however, particularly in resource-poor countries, it is a major cause of maternal morbidity (poor health) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ekanem-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekanem 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfield 1989</LINK>). In this setting, anaemia may result from inadequate dietary intake, parasitic infection or malaria, and may be exacerbated by the physiological effects of pregnancy and blood loss at the time of birth (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Worldwide, anaemia contributed to approximately 20% of the 515,000 maternal deaths in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Anaemia is often associated with other markers on blood testing of low iron stores in the body. During pregnancy most women show a fall in haemoglobin concentration as part of a normal response to pregnancy, where there is an increase in plasma and the circulating blood volume, which protects the woman from the blood loss associated with birth. The generally accepted threshold for anaemia in nonpregnant women is a haemoglobin concentration of less than 12 g/dL (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). However, it should be noted that this is a value statistically derived from deviations from the population mean, and does not necessarily mean that the woman will have clinical symptoms associated with anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaemia in the postpartum period may be associated with an increased prevalence of breathlessness, tiredness, palpitations and maternal infections, particularly of the urinary tract (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vora-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vora 1998</LINK>). Such symptoms may cause women to experience difficulty caring for their baby, and may influence the emotional bond the mother has with her baby (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1987</LINK>). <B>
<I>
<BR/>

</B>
<BR/>Blood transfusions have been used in the treatment of postpartum anaemia, but there are risks associated with its use. These include reactions secondary to contamination (most commonly with leukocytes or red blood cells), infections (particularly with hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and cytomegalovirus), fluid overload, allergic reactions, lung injury and air embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Klapholz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klapholz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naef-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naef 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skolnick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skolnick 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waymack-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waymack 1990</LINK>). Immunological reactions may be 'minor' and include fever, chills, urticaria (skin rash and/or hives), or more severe, including acute haemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) arising from administration of incompatible blood (<LINK REF="REF-Naef-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naef 1995b</LINK>). Hepatitis C infection is estimated to occur in approximately 0.1% of all patients who receive blood. The cost of blood transfusions includes extensive costs of screening the blood for infection, storage and sterile administration of blood products, all of which may generate increased financial burden, particularly in under-resourced countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ekanem-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekanem 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the risks of blood transfusion and financial constraints, attention has been directed towards other forms of treatment of anaemia such as iron supplements and erythropoietin therapy, both oral (by mouth) and parenteral (by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection). Erythropoietin is a hormone that is produced by the body and acts to stimulate red blood cell production.</P>
<P>Oral iron therapy has been used for centuries as a treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Dudrick-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudrick 1986</LINK>), and has been used to treat iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2003</LINK>). The use of oral iron therapy is associated with some side-effects, including constipation, nausea and gastric irritation. When given by injection, iron has been associated with pain and redness (erythema) at the injection site, and rarely anaphylactic reaction, characterised by itching, redness and in severe cases angioedema (swelling), vascular collapse, bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) and shock. Erythropoietin (EPO) therapy is a relatively recently identified alternative to blood transfusions for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia, and has been used extensively in the treatment of anaemia associated with renal (kidney) disease. There are a few case reports of EPO therapy in people who have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds, with positive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1990</LINK>), thus highlighting the potential use of EPO in the treatment of other forms of iron deficiency anaemia. Adverse effects of EPO treatment include mild flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, muscle pains and weakness, headache and fatigue. Uncommon, but more serious adverse effects include hypertension (high blood pressure) and seizures and, more recently, pure red-cell aplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Casadevall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casadevall 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Completeness of follow up was assessed for each included study as follows:<BR/>A = less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>B = 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>C = 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>D = 20% or more of the participants excluded;<BR/>E = unclear.</P>
<P>For blinding of assessment of outcome:<BR/>A = neither the investigator (outcome assessor) nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated allotment;<BR/>B = either the investigator (outcome assessor) or participant knew the allocation. Or neither knew, but the outcome means that it is likely a significant portion of the participant's allocation could be easily identified;<BR/>C = no blinding - investigator (outcome assessor) and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment;<BR/>D = unclear.</P>
<P>Descriptive data included the authors, year of publication, setting, country, time span of trial, pretrial calculation of sample size and the number of participants randomised and analysed.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with the RevMan Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2004</LINK>). For continuous data we expressed results for each study as weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We used a random effects model.</P>
<P>We investigated heterogeneity in the data using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic and cautiously explored it using sensitivity analyses (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50% was regarded as statistically significant heterogeneity).</P>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>dose administered;</LI>
<LI>frequency of administration;</LI>
<LI>duration of treatment;</LI>
<LI>study setting - resource-poor versus resource-rich countries;</LI>
<LI>severity of anaemia at trial entry;</LI>
<LI>concurrent disease at trial entry (including HIV, sickle cell disease, thalassaemia).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We were unable to perform most of the planned subgroup analyses due to the smallnumber of included trials. We explored results associated with route of treatment administration and duration of treatment for some outcomes when iron was compared with erythropoietin (<I>see</I> 'Graphs and tables'). Timing of outcome measurement varied across trials. To facilitate analyses, we grouped the results into two measurement periods, reflecting short- and longer-term effects: within the first two weeks after treatment, and between two weeks and six weeks after treatment.</P>

<P>Thirteen studies describing treatment of postpartum anaemia were identified, with seven not meeting the selection criteria. (Twenty-seven reports from an updated search in June 2012 have been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.) We excluded two trials because of inadequate randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Danko-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Danko 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huch-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Huch 1992</LINK>), one because it did not report on interventions defined as appropriate for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1953</LINK>), two reported results on women who were not anaemic (<LINK REF="STD-Mara-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mara 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Picha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Picha 1975</LINK>), one combined pregnant and postpartum women with anaemia in the study population (<LINK REF="STD-Casparis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Casparis 1996</LINK>) and one summarised the results of trials that were reported in included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The six included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involved 411 women (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebrecht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrecht 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>). Some of the RCTs reported on more than one intervention. Four RCTs compared treatment with erythropoietin and iron to treatment with iron only (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebrecht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrecht 1995</LINK>), one RCT compared treatment with erythropoietin to treatment with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1995</LINK>), two RCTs compared different routes of erythropoietin administration (intravenous versus subcutaneous) (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>), and one RCT compared erythropoietin given as one dose with that given as two doses (<LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>). No RCTs were identified that described results of folate therapy or blood transfusion as an intervention.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>, 300 units/kg of erythropoietin (EPO) were administered to women in the EPO group once, and in <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>, this dose was administered daily for four days. In <LINK REF="STD-Lebrecht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrecht 1995</LINK>, 20,000 units of EPO were given to women as a single dose. In <LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>, 200 units/kg of EPO were administered to women in the EPO group daily for 15 days. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1995</LINK> administered 10,000 units of EPO twice. In <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>, two doses of 150 units/kg were compared with a single dose of 300 units/kg of EPO.</P>
<P>All RCTs focused on haematological indices in their results, with limited information regarding clinical outcomes. Of the clinical outcomes described, use of blood transfusions was described by two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>), not lactating by one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>), thromboembolic complications by two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrecht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrecht 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makrydimas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Makrydimas 1998</LINK>), serious reactions by two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>), and side-effects for erythropoietin by two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Lebrecht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebrecht 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>).</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Three trials reported using sealed envelopes to allocate women to treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Breymann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breymann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Breymann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmermann-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmermann 1994</LINK>). The remaining three studies, though stated to be randomised studies, were unclear in their method of concealment of allocation. All six trials were coded B for allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Blinding to intervention for either investigators or women did not appear to have occurred in any of the studies. Insufficient information was provided to determine whether blinding of outcome assessors had occurred in any of the studies.</P>
<P>No losses to follow up were reported, except for <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1995</LINK> who described a drop-out rate of over 20% (with no differences in dropout rate between the intervention and control groups).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-23 12:45:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies described treatment with erythropoietin or iron as their primary interventions. Women in both the intervention and control groups received iron supplementation in all studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1995</LINK>). No studies were identified that described treatment with blood transfusion, and for each intervention there were only one or two studies that reported the same outcomes and thus had results that could be combined.</P>
<P>Few of the prespecified outcomes were reported by the studies regarding 'maternal outcomes', 'use of health resources', 'maternal satisfaction with care', and 'side-effects of treatment'.</P>
<P>The remainder of the results reported in the studies were blood indices. While these were not prespecified in the protocol as outcome measures that were of relevance to the population, we decided that to omit haematological outcomes altogether when reporting the results of the review would mean that much of the data reported by the studies would be lost. Thus we have presented the outcomes for the haematological studies as subsidiary outcomes reported by the reviewers in each section. The results are presented in dot point form to allow easier interpretation. The small number of women in the groups studied meant the confidence intervals were wide. Larger groups may have provided statistically significant results. Further details are provided in 'Graphs and tables'.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies is generally reasonable; however their usefulness in this review is restricted by the interventions and outcomes reported. There is very limited information relating to clinical outcomes in the included studies, despite extensive reporting of haematological indices. </P>
<P>Laboratory haemoglobin values may not directly reflect the woman's clinical state. It is unclear whether the women involved in the original studies were clinically symptomatic, and treatment of a woman's symptoms would seem more appropriate than treatment determined by an arbitrary level of haemoglobin or values from other haematological indices. A haemoglobin of less than 12 g/dL is a very conservative marker for iron deficiency anaemia, and many women may not experience symptoms (and therefore will not require treatment) at this level. Most studies in the review reported results for women with an haemoglobin of 10 g/dL or less, but did not categorise the severity of anaemia for analysis. Future studies would benefit from further assessment of the results of treatment according to the severity of anaemia. </P>
<P>The availability of blood transfusion and issues related to safety and sterility mean that it has a limited role in treatment for women in low- and middle-income countries. Similarly, erythropoietin is expensive and therefore not a realistic treatment option for those women at greatest risk of postpartum anaemia. Pure red cell aplasia has been reported as a rare adverse effect of erythropoietin, which is thought to be a consequence of antibody formation (<LINK REF="REF-Casadevall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casadevall 2002</LINK>). One of the companies marketing erythropoietin (as EPREX) has recommended that it should be given intravenously where possible, since this may reduce the risk of antibody formation (<LINK REF="REF-AADRB-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AADRB 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>As women in resource-poor countries are more likely to suffer morbidity and/or mortality secondary to postpartum anaemia, future trials should address the role of simple and cost-effective strategies to improve clinical outcomes for these women, in particular the role of oral iron therapy.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is limited evidence for favourable outcomes for treatment of postpartum anaemia with erythropoietin, with small studies suggesting improved lactation, without an increase in side-effects. Haematological indices also appear to be favourably affected by treatment with erythropoietin, although how this relates to clinical practice is uncertain.</P>
<P>Information regarding the route of administration of erythropoietin is poor, as is information relating to outcomes following treatment with iron and blood transfusions. The possibility of rare adverse effects (such as red cell aplasia) needs to be monitored. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>
<BR/>Further high quality trials are required that assess the treatment of postpartum anaemia with oral and parental iron and blood transfusions and focus on clinically relevant outcomes such as maternal outcomes, safety and use of health resources. The effectiveness of common interventions such as iron-rich diet should also be assessed.</P>
