<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-22 15:50:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using umbilical artery catheters with the hole in the side instead of end leads to serious complications. The umbilical artery catheters (tubes) (UACs) commonly used in neonatal intensive care to monitor babies can sometimes cause them problems. They can be used with different accompanying doses of the drug heparin, and in different positions. The design of catheters can vary. The review found that catheters with a hole in the side instead of at the end resulted in one in three babies experiencing aortic thrombosis (a clot in the heart's major artery).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 08:43:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are among the most commonly used monitoring methodologies in neonatal intensive care. Immediately after insertion of a UAC, local vascular compromise is frequently evident, usually in the form of blue or white toes, but occasionally with more severe and extensive ischemic manifestations. Aortic thrombi and renal ischemia have also been described. Some epidemiologic and case control studies have shown that the use of umbilical artery catheterisation is statistically associated with the later development of necrotizing enterocolitis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 08:43:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the variations in design of the catheters has been the development of end-hole or side-hole catheters. The side hole catheters often have an integral oxygen electrode at the tip necessitating the placement of the orifice away from the tip. In the early years of neonatal intensive care, feeding tubes, which also traditionally have a side hole, may have been used as catheters for umbilical artery lines. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-30 08:43:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The position of the catheter hole could potentially lead to a difference in complication rates as the flow dynamics around the tip of the catheter will change. This may lead to a difference in the rate of clinically apparent ischemic events, or of aortic thrombosis.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 15:02:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original search strategy retrieved 849 articles. These were further reduced by restricting the search by use of the terms prospective, random#, control#, comparative or clinical. When studies of animal subjects and of epidural catheterisation were also removed, 233 reports remained. The abstract of each was read individually to determine if there was a possibility that the papers were reporting randomized prospective controlled trials. No new trials comparing end hole and side hole catheters were discovered at the time of the November 1998 and April 2009 update to this review.</P>
<P>The search revealed only one trial investigating catheter design (<LINK REF="STD-Wesstrom-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wesstrom 1979</LINK>). The study was designed to randomly assign infants requiring umbilical catheter placement to one of four groups, high end hole, high side hole, low end hole or low side hole catheter. Infants were either preterm or term, requiring umbilical catheterisation for numerous different reasons. After the first 15 months of the study the side hole groups were dropped, presumably because of the high incidence of aortic thrombosis, and for the final four months randomization was to high or low placement of end hole catheters only. The end hole catheter used was an 'Argyle' umbilical catheter; the side hole catheter was an Argyle feeding tube. Most catheters were 5 Fr size.</P>
<P>The major outcome variable was aortic thrombosis. This was determined either by single shot angiography at the time of removal of the catheter or at autopsy. Clinically apparent sequelae were said to be recorded, but are not clearly described.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the designs of the two largest prospective trials of umbilical artery catheter use, <LINK REF="REF-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">UACTSG 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Kempley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempley 1993</LINK>, did not specify catheter type. Kempley's trial included both end and side hole catheters, of 3.5, 4.0 and 5.0 French sizes, but does not give results by catheter design, whereas <LINK REF="REF-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">UACTSG 1992</LINK> did not mention catheter design at all, but restricted the size to 3.5 Fr.</P>

<P>
<B>End hole compared to side hole catheters (COMPARISON 1)</B>
</P>
<P>Side hole catheters appear to have a much higher incidence of thromboses than end-hole catheters from this single study (<LINK REF="STD-Wesstrom-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wesstrom 1979</LINK>). The relative risk for the occurrence of aortic thrombosis with end hole catheters compared to side hole catheters is 0.27 (95% CI 0.11, 0.67). The risk difference is -0.35 (95% CI -0.58, -0.12); this indicates that we can expect to prevent one case of aortic thrombosis in every three infants (95% CI 2, 8) who receive an end hold rather than a side hole catheter.</P>
<P>No other outcomes are well enough described to determine their relative frequency with end hole compared to side hole catheters.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given the significant increase in aortic thrombosis rates when using side hole catheters, catheters of such a design could not be recommended for routine use in newborn infants for umbilical arterial lines. It must be remembered that the catheter used in the one evaluable study was a feeding tube, which would not be utilised today by many centers, and are not likely to be approved for such use by their manufacturers. The oxygen electrode tipped catheter (which also usually has a side hole) has not been tested in any similar study, and may have a different frequency of thrombosis. Other catheters with designs which incorporate a side hole should be shown to be safe in prospective comparative trials before being introduced for clinical use.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Currently, catheters designed with a side hole should not be used routinely for umbilical artery catheterisation in the newborn.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies to determine safety of catheters with non-standard designs should be performed. In particular the safety of the oxygen electrode tipped catheter which are used by some centers should be investigated.</P>
