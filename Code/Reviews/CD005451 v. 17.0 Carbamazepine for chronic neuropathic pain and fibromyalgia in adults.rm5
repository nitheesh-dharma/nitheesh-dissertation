It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people. Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is lacking, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain.</P><P>Carbamazepine was developed to treat epilepsy, but it is now used to treat various forms of chronic pain. We performed searches (up to February 2014) to look for clinical trials where carbamazepine was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found 10 studies involving 418 people involved in testing carbamazepine. Studies were not generally of very good quality. Most were very small, as well as of short duration. Studies lasting only one or two weeks are unhelpful when pain can last for years.</P><P>There was not enough good quality evidence to say how well carbamazepine worked in any neuropathic pain condition. Pooling four small studies showed that it was better than placebo, but the result cannot be relied upon. There was not enough information from these studies to make any reliable comment on adverse events or harm.</P><P>Carbamazepine is probably helpful for some people with chronic neuropathic pain. It is not possible to know beforehand who will benefit and who will not. </P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-02-11 11:28:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-19 12:06:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This is an update of a Cochrane review entitled 'Carbamazepine for acute and chronic pain in adults' published in Issue 1, 2011. Some antiepileptic medicines have a place in the treatment of neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This updated review considers the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia only, and adds no new studies. The update uses higher standards of evidence than the earlier review, which results in the exclusion of five studies that were previously included.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-11-19 12:06:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the analgesic efficacy of carbamazepine in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate adverse events reported in the studies.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-11 11:28:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL up to February 2014. Additional studies were sought from clinical trials databases, and the reference list of retrieved articles and reviews.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-29 11:12:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Randomised, double blind, active or placebo controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of carbamazepine (any dose, by any route, and for at least two weeks' duration) for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, with at least 10 participants per treatment group. Participants were adults aged 18 and over.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 12:53:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Two study authors independently extracted data on efficacy, adverse events, and withdrawals, and examined issues of study quality. Numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNT) or harmful effect (NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from dichotomous data.</P><P>We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts, at least 200 participants in the comparison, at least 8 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that was considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 12:53:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Yvonne M Roy"><P>Ten included studies (11 publications) enrolled 480 participants with trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and post stroke pain. Nine studies used a cross-over design, and one a parallel group design. Most of the studies were of short duration, lasting four weeks or less.</P><P>No study provided first or second tier evidence for an efficacy outcome. Using third tier evidence, carbamazepine generally provided better pain relief than placebo in the three conditions studied, with some indication of pain improvement over mainly the short term, but with poorly defined outcomes, incomplete reporting, and in small numbers of participants. There were too few data in studies comparing carbamazepine with active comparators to draw any conclusions.</P><P>In four studies 65% (113/173) of participants experienced at least one adverse event with carbamazepine, and 27% (47/173) with placebo; for every five participants treated, two experienced an adverse event who would not have done so with placebo. In eight studies 3% (8/268) of participants withdrew due to adverse events with carbamazepine, and none (0/255) with placebo. Serious adverse events were not reported consistently; rashes were associated with carbamazepine. Four deaths occurred in patients on carbamazepine, with no obvious drug association.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-20 09:18:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Carbamazepine is probably effective in some people with chronic neuropathic pain, but with caveats. No trial was longer than four weeks, had good reporting quality, nor used outcomes equivalent to substantial clinical benefit. In these circumstances, caution is needed in interpretation, and meaningful comparison with other interventions is not possible.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-09 12:42:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-09 09:21:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Phil Wiffen"><P>This updated review was originally published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> as 'Anticonvulsant drugs for acute and chronic pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2000</LINK>). At the third update in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2003</LINK>), 12 new included studies were identified mainly of the newer antiepileptics (anticonvulsants) gabapentin and lamotrigine. In total the included studies provided data on six different medicines used in at least six identified neuropathic pain conditions. Issues of dose response and trial design added to the complexity. A decision was therefore taken to split that review into a number of smaller reviews each covering one medicine (chemical entity). In 2010 a review of carbamazepine for acute and chronic pain was published, and in 2011 the authors reviewed the literature and concluded that there were unlikely to be any new studies, so the review was marked as stable (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2011a</LINK>).</P><P>The decision to update it now, and concentrate on chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, was made because there have been more advances in the rigour with which we assess studies and report data, and in order to conform with other reviews in the series on neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. In particular we consider study size and duration, outcomes reported, and method of imputation for withdrawals, and report results in three tiers according to outcome and freedom from known sources of bias. We wanted to bring this review in line with a template protocol so that it can be easily included in overview of antiepileptics for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013a</LINK>). Reviews of clonazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Corrigan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrigan 2012</LINK>), gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), lacosamide (<LINK REF="REF-Hearn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hearn 2012</LINK>), lamotrigine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013b</LINK>), oxcarbazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>), phenytoin (<LINK REF="REF-Birse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birse 2012</LINK>), pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>), topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013c</LINK>), and valproic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2011</LINK>) have been completed. All the reviews analyse results according to the particular conditions in which they have been studied, and it is expected that in future updates fibromyalgia, at least, will become the subject of separate reviews.</P><P>The aim is for all our reviews to use the same methods, based on new criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). A Cochrane review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>). This indicates that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so. While fibromyalgia is considered to have a different aetiology from chronic neuropathic pain, it is a condition that responds to the same therapies. Because of limitations in the number of available clinical trials, it is convenient to consider fibromyalgia together with neuropathic pain. We make no presumption to pool data across individual neuropathic pain conditions or fibromyalgia, but will consider each condition separately.</P><P>The small amount of information in the 2011 review relating to acute pain has been moved to <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:55:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain definition of <I>neuropathic pain</I> is "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system" (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2011</LINK>) based on an earlier consensus meeting (<LINK REF="REF-Treede-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treede 2008</LINK>). Neuropathic pain may be caused by nerve damage, but is often followed by changes in the central nervous system (CNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moisset-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moisset 2007</LINK>). It is complex, and neuropathic pain features can be found in patients with joint pain (<LINK REF="REF-Soni-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soni 2013</LINK>).</P><P><I>Fibromyalgia</I> is defined as widespread pain for longer than three months with pain on palpation at 11 or more of 18 specified tender points (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1990</LINK>), and is frequently associated with other symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, and depression. More recently, a definition of fibromyalgia has been proposed based on symptom severity and the presence of widespread pain (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2010</LINK>). The cause, or causes, are not well understood, but it has features in common with neuropathic pain, including changes in the CNS. Moreover, patients with neuropathic pain and those with fibromyalgia experience similar sensory phenomena (<LINK REF="REF-Koroschetz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koroschetz 2011</LINK>), and peripheral nerve fibre changes seen in neuropathic pain also occur in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Oaklander-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oaklander 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-_x00dc__x00e7_eyler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Üçeyler 2013</LINK>). Many people with these conditions are significantly disabled with moderate or severe pain for many years.</P><P>In primary care in the United Kingdom (UK), the incidences per 100,000 person-years' observation have been reported as 28 (95% CI 27 to 30) for postherpetic neuralgia, 27 (26 to 29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (0.6 to 1.1) for phantom limb pain, and 21 (20 to 22) for painful diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). Estimates vary between studies, often because of small numbers of cases. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia has been estimated at 4 in 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1994</LINK>), while more recently, a study of facial pain in The Netherlands found incidences per 100,000 person-years of 12.6 for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9 for postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2009</LINK>). A systematic review of chronic pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, can be more common, with prevalence rates up to 400 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>). The prevalence of neuropathic pain was reported as being 3.3% in Austria (<LINK REF="REF-Gustorff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustorff 2008</LINK>), 6.9% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 2008</LINK>) and as high as 8% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>), and about 7% in a systematic review of studies published since 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>). The incidence of some forms of neuropathic pain, such as diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2013</LINK>). Fibromyalgia is common, especially in women, with an all-age prevalence of 12%, and a female to male ratio of 6:1 (<LINK REF="REF-McNally-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNally 2006</LINK>).</P><P>Neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia are known to be difficult to treat effectively, with only a minority of individuals experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from any one intervention. A multidisciplinary approach is now advocated, with pharmacological interventions being combined with physical and/or cognitive interventions. Conventional analgesics are usually not effective.

High concentration topical capsaicin may benefit some patients with postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>).

It is licensed in the United Kingdom and United States of America for paroxysmal pain of trigeminal neuralgia (dosage up to 1600 mg daily), but has been used off-label for other types of neuropathic pain. It is usually prescribed as a tablet, but chewable tablet, liquid, and suppository formulations are manufactured.</P><P>Antiepileptic drug use is not without risk: serious adverse effects have been reported, including deaths from haematological reactions (blood dyscrasias; <LINK REF="REF-Sweetman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweetman 2005</LINK>), and life-threatening cutaneous problems (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kulkantrakorn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulkantrakorn 2012</LINK>). Carbamazepine is also known to stimulate synthesis of certain enzymes, which can interfere with other drug therapies (e.g. anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, statins, antihypertensives) causing clinical problems, particularly at initiation and withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 2013</LINK>).

The most important change is the move from using average pain scores, or average change in pain scores, to using the number of patients who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%); this level of pain relief has been shown to correlate with improvements in comorbid symptoms, function, and quality of life. These standards are set out in the reference guide for pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-AUREF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUREF 2012</LINK>) and reflect what patients with chronic pain want from treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>).</P><P>This Cochrane review will assess evidence in ways that make both statistical and clinical sense, and will use developing criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>).

On whom then does the burden of proof fall? (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 1993</LINK>). The aim of this systematic review was to review the effectiveness and safety of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine in the management of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Since the first version of this review, gabapentin has become established as a treatment for neuropathic pain, and is now licensed for this indication in a number of countries. The problem is that there is very little good evidence to support the received wisdom regarding carbamazepine and its use in neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia generally, or even in trigeminal neuralgia, where response to carbamazepine has in the past been regarded as almost pathognomic.</P><P>More recent antiepileptic drugs have good evidence of effect, as with gabapentin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), pregabalin (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>), or oxcarbazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2013</LINK>), or good evidence of lack of effect as with lamotrigine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013b</LINK>) and topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013c</LINK>).

Although the authors of the original reports were originally contacted by letter, not all of them replied, and of those who did, only <LINK REF="STD-Leijon-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Leijon 1989</LINK> was able to provide additional data.</P><P>Doses of carbamazepine used in some of the studies were small; Gomez Perez, for example, used 200 mg daily, which while effective in some is not effective in all (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1981</LINK>). Dose escalation was rapid in some studies, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Although carbamazepine takes two to four days to achieve its maximum effect, auto induction of enzymes that metabolise the drug, which is complete at three weeks, often means that late dose increases are needed. These factors are largely ignored, and this limits the applicability of the available evidence.</P><P>These studies do not provide adequate information about adverse events, and in particular serious adverse events. This is of particular importance for serious cutaneous adverse events in some parts of the world.

While the frequency of this allele is low in Europe, its frequency in Asian populations is 5-10% (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2010</LINK>).

Only third tier evidence was available, which is subject to potentially major bias in favour of active therapy. No trial was longer than four weeks, or of good reporting quality, nor used outcomes equivalent to substantial clinical benefit. In these circumstances, caution is needed in interpretation, and meaningful comparison with other interventions is not possible. An overview of antiepileptics in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia concluded that, among antiepileptic drugs, clinical trial evidence supports only the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in some neuropathic pain conditions (painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain) and fibromyalgia (Wiffen 2013b).</P><P>The use of carbamazepine in neuropathic pain has stood the test of time in the clinic, but carbamazepine usually does not now feature in treatment algorithms, other than for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Current guidance in the UK states 'Despite the lack of trial evidence, it is perceived by clinicians to be efficacious. Further research should be conducted as described in the table below.' (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>)</P><P>Medical students are often taught that a positive response to carbamazepine is 'diagnostic' for trigeminal neuralgia. Even the suspect evidence we have indicates that this is not the case, with perhaps just over half of participants with trigeminal neuralgia having a good response to carbamazepine. Clinically it appears that trigeminal neuralgia can become refractory to carbamazepine.</P><P>The usual clinical decision for chronic neuropathic pain is a choice between antidepressant and antiepileptic as first-line treatment, and there is insufficient evidence to support the use of carbamazepine as first line. In addition the need for laboratory monitoring and significant drug interactions with the use of carbamazepine have discouraged the use of carbamazepine with the emergence of newer antiepileptic drugs, such as gabapentin and pregabalin.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:45:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review shows that there is still a need for large, high quality, long duration studies using sensible outcomes to establish relative effectiveness of different antiepileptics in chronic pain syndromes, and for comparisons of other treatments such as antidepressants with antiepileptics; appropriate trial designs have been suggested for this (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009c</LINK>).

For this condition, for all interventions, there have been only a handful of good quality studies reported.

We also considered the implications of incomplete outcome assessment, and have analysed results according to the strength of the evidence (in three tiers).</P><P>The small amount of information relating to acute pain from the earlier review has been moved to <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2018-02-27 11:26:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry L D Harding"><P>Review methods been substantially amended following a search for new trials up to June 2010. Methods used have been further amended in 2013 to bring it in line with current standards of evidence in chronic pain, and following new searches to bring the evidence up to date.</P><P>A restricted search in February 2018 did not identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. The authors and editors are confident that further research will not change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. If appropriate, we will update the review if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.</P></PUBLIC_NOTES></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-02-28 13:34:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry Harding">

how efficacy of both conventional and unconventional treatments is assessed in chronic painful conditions. The outcomes used today are better defined, particularly with new criteria of what constitutes moderate or substantial benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>); older trials may only report participants with 'any improvement'. Newer trials tend to be larger, avoiding problems from the random play of chance. Newer trials also tend to be longer, up to 12 weeks, and longer trials provide a more rigorous and valid assessment of efficacy in chronic conditions. New standards have evolved for assessing efficacy in neuropathic pain, we are now applying stricter criteria for inclusion of trials and assessment of outcomes, and we are more aware of problems that may affect our overall assessment.</P><P>To summarise, some of the recent insights into studies in neuropathic pain and chronic pain more generally that make a new review necessary, over and above including more trials are:</P><OL><LI>Pain relief results tend to have a U-shaped distribution rather than a bell-shaped distribution, with participants either achieving very good levels of pain relief, or little or none. This is the case for acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>), fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2010</LINK>), and arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009b</LINK>); in all cases average results usually describe the actual experience of almost no-one in the trial. Continuous data expressed as averages should be regarded as potentially misleading, unless it can be proved to be suitable. Systematic reviews now frequently report results for responders (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>).</LI><LI>This means we have to depend on dichotomous results usually from pain changes or patient global assessments. The IMMPACT group has helped with their definitions of minimal, moderate, and substantial improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). In arthritis, trials shorter than 12 weeks, and especially those shorter than eight weeks, overestimate the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009b</LINK>); the effect is particularly strong for less effective analgesics. What is not always clear is how withdrawals are reported. Withdrawals can be high in some chronic pain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010b</LINK>).</LI><LI>The proportion with at least moderate benefit can be small, falling from 60% with an effective medicine in arthritis, to 30% in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane Review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009a</LINK>). This indicates that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so.</LI><LI>Finally, individual patient analyses indicate that patients who get clinically useful pain relief (moderate or better) have major benefits in many other outcomes, affecting quality of life in a major way (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010c</LINK>). Good response to pain predicts good effects for other troublesome symptoms like sleep, fatigue and depression.</LI></OL><P>These are by no means the only issues of trial validity that have been raised recently. A summary of what constitutes evidence in trials and reviews in chronic pain has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>). This review has attempted to address all of them, so that the review is consistent with current best practice.</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-02" MODIFIED="2013-08-29 09:46:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2013-08-06 08:52:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Acute pain</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-29 09:46:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Acute pain</HEADING><P>A single study in acute herpes zoster examined whether carbamazepine reduced later development of postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Keczkes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Keczkes 1980</LINK>).</P><P>Comparing carbamazepine 400 mg daily with prednisolone (40 mg daily for 10 days reducing to zero over three subsequent weeks) in the management of acute herpes zoster, participants treated with prednisolone reported less pain and faster skin healing on average (3.7 weeks compared to 5.3 weeks) than those treated with carbamazepine.
