<P>Taking zinc during pregnancy helps to slightly reduce preterm births, but does not prevent other problems such as low birthweight babies.</P>
<P>Many women of childbearing age may have mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc concentrations may cause preterm birth or they may even prolong labour. It is also possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well. This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, involving over 17,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementation has a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does not help to prevent low birthweight babies compared with not giving zinc supplements before 27 weeks of pregnancy. One trial did not contribute data. The overall risk of bias was unclear in half of the studies. No clear differences were seen for development of pregnancy hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials of women with low incomes. In some trials all women were also given iron, folate or vitamins or combinations of these. UNICEF is already promoting antenatal use of multiple-micronutrient supplementation, including zinc, to all pregnant women in developing countries. Finding ways to improve women's overall nutritional status, particularly in low-income areas, will do more to improve the health of mothers and babies than supplementing pregnant women with zinc alone. In low- to middle- income countries, addressing anaemia and infections, such as malaria and hookworm, is also necessary.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-01-16 17:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It has been suggested that low serum zinc levels may be associated with suboptimal outcomes of pregnancy such as prolonged labour, atonic postpartum haemorrhage, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labour and post-term pregnancies, although many of these associations have not yet been established. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-16 17:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported in 54 papers involving over 17,000 women and their babies. One trial did not contribute data. Trials were generally at low risk of bias. Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials of 7637 women). This was not accompanied by a similar reduction in numbers of babies with low birthweight (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 14 trials of 5643 women). No clear differences were seen between the zinc and no zinc groups for any of the other primary maternal or neonatal outcomes, except for induction of labour in a single trial. No differing patterns were evident in the subgroups of women with low versus normal zinc and nutrition levels or in women who complied with their treatment versus those who did not. The GRADE quality of the evidence was moderate for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, and low birthweight, and low for stillbirth or neonatal death and birthweight.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-14 11:44:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for a 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials involving women of low income and this has some relevance in areas of high perinatal mortality. There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits. Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations in impoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrient and or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be an urgent priority.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-17 14:19:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall nutritional status of the mother during pregnancy is a significant contributor to both maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Koblinsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koblinsky 1995</LINK>). This is likely to be even more crucial in developing countries where anaemia and infections, such as malaria and hookworm, compound the issue even further.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-17 14:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Zinc is known to play an important role in many biological functions, including protein synthesis and nucleic acid metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Valee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valee 1993</LINK>). Although severe zinc deficiency is now considered rare, mild to moderate deficiency may be relatively common throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Sanstead-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanstead 1991</LINK>). In a review of literature published between 1970 and 1991, <LINK REF="REF-Parr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parr 1996</LINK> noted that, on average, pregnant and lactating women worldwide consumed 9.6 mg zinc per day, well below the recommended 15 mg daily, during the last two trimesters of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Sanstead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanstead 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). In animal studies, zinc deficiency during the early stages of pregnancy is associated with reduced fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Apgar-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apgar 1970</LINK>), fetal neurological malformations and growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1975</LINK>), and deficiency in later stages of pregnancy negatively affects neuronal growth and may also be associated with impaired brain function and behavioural abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Golub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golub 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-15 11:32:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In humans, pregnant women with acrodermatitis enteropathica (an inherited defect in zinc absorption from the bowel) show association with increased risk of congenital malformations and pregnancy losses (<LINK REF="REF-Verburg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verburg 1974</LINK>). Numerous reports have noted low serum zinc levels to be linked with abnormalities of labour such as prolonged labour and atonic postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Prema-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prema 1980</LINK>), pregnancy-induced hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Jameson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jameson 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jameson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jameson 1993</LINK>), preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1981</LINK>) and post-term pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Simmer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 1985</LINK>). Others (<LINK REF="REF-Cherry-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chesters-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesters 1982</LINK>) have failed to show any such association.</P>
<P>Some researchers have also reported an association between low zinc and small-for-gestational age babies, and poor perinatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Kiilholma-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiilholma 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiilholma-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiilholma 1984b</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kirksey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirksey 1994</LINK> reported low maternal serum zinc levels during pregnancy to be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight and preterm birth. Low birthweight babies have higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to infectious disease and impaired immunity and, thus, it is possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth and well being too.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-17 14:20:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies of the effects of zinc supplementation have differed in their findings. These inconsistencies in study findings could be due to lack of consensus on accurate assessment of zinc status (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 1991</LINK>) and to differences in the populations studied. Randomised controlled trials of zinc supplementation in pregnancy would help to address the association, if any, between zinc deficiency and pregnancy outcome and neonatal and infant health and well being.</P>
<P>The fetal nervous system also develops progressively during pregnancy influencing motor and autonomic functions. Change in the pattern of fetal heart rate and movements monitored electronically have been related to fetal neuro behavioural development (<LINK REF="REF-DiPietro-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiPietro 1996</LINK>) and atypical neurodevelopment has been shown in fetuses that exhibit other indicators of neurologic compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Hepper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hepper 1995</LINK>). In a publication from Egypt, <LINK REF="REF-Kirskey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirskey 1991</LINK> also reported a positive association between maternal zinc status during the second trimester of pregnancy and newborn behaviour.</P>
<P>It is plausible that the effect of zinc supplementation would vary among different population groups depending on their nutritional status, with any effect likely to be more apparent in women from the developing world. Currently, UNICEF is already promoting antenatal use of multiple-micronutrient supplementation, including zinc, to all pregnant women in developing countries (<LINK REF="STD-Nepal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nepal 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to systematically review all randomised controlled trials of zinc supplementation in pregnancy and to evaluate the role of zinc as it relates to pregnancy, labour and birth as well as to maternal and infant health and well being.</P>

PM and RM independently re-assessed risk of bias using the updated format newly required for all the studies already included in the previous version due to changes in methods (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following primary outcomes for the main comparisons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Preterm labour or birth (less than 37 weeks), or both.</LI>
<LI>Stillbirth or neonatal death.</LI>
<LI>Birthweight.</LI>
<LI>Small-for-gestational age (birthweight less than 10th centile for gestational age).</LI>
<LI>Low birthweight (less than 2.5 kg).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create 'Summary of findings' tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We would have adjusted their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook </I>using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. Had we used ICCs from other sources, we would have reported this and conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. We included one cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nepal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nepal 2003</LINK>) - analyses adjusted for clustering were presented in study reports and so we did not need to perform the above additional calculations for these study results</P>
<P>We synthesised the relevant information from <LINK REF="STD-Nepal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nepal 2003</LINK> and the individually-randomised trials. We considered it reasonable to combine the results from both as there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they had been allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary when an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful we did not combine trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants and settings</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen studies included women from low- and middle-income settings. One of the four studies in the higher-income or mixed-income settings only recruited women at risk of giving birth to small-for-gestational age babies (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1991a</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Baseline zinc concentrations and nutritional status</HEADING>
<P>Women in most of the studies had, or were likely to have low zinc concentrations and low nutritional status. It is difficult to assess zinc status and most studies have assumed that pregnant women from low-income groups would be low in zinc as part of their overall poor nutritional status. Where studied, the improvement in serum zinc concentrations in the supplemented group supports this assumption (<LINK REF="STD-Bangladesh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bangladesh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peru-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peru 1999</LINK>). The only studies likely to have included women with normal zinc concentrations were <LINK REF="STD-UK-1989" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1991b</LINK>.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-14 02:59:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many studies have demonstrated some positive response on biochemical parameters such as serum zinc status of mother or baby, or both, with supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Bangladesh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bangladesh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peru-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peru 1999</LINK>) as have studies of iron supplementation in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Pena_x002d_Rosas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pena-Rosas 2006</LINK>). It is now crucial to focus on the impact of any intervention on outcomes that are of clinical significance and particularly those that may be related to maternal, fetal, neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity. This is relevant because of the limited resources, both financial and human, currently available worldwide but in particular to the developing countries where such morbidity and mortality is high.</P>
<P>This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, including over 17,000 women and their babies, has not provided compelling evidence for routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy, although the finding of a reduction in preterm births warrants further investigation, as does the suggestion of reporting bias from the funnel plot on small-for-gestational age. Subgroup analysis of the 17 studies involving women who are or are likely to be zinc deficient, such as populations from developing countries or from low socioeconomic groups from western countries, also did not make a case for zinc supplementation in those groups of women. This is consistent with a review of maternal zinc supplementation in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Osendarp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osendarp 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-16 17:17:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The small but significant reduction in preterm birth in the zinc group deserves further attention; is it possible that improving nutrition would cause an even greater reduction? The Cochrane review on micronutrient supplementation did not show any significance in reduction of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2012</LINK>). Although dosage of zinc may play a role, no dose-response pattern was evident in this review (with the possible exception of pre-eclampsia). It is possible that zinc used in conjunction with iron may dilute the effect of supplementation. The intrauterine growth effect seen in <LINK REF="STD-UK-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1991a</LINK>, where women were selected on the basis of being at risk for giving birth to a small-for-gestational age baby, has not been replicated. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bangladesh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bangladesh 2000</LINK> study, where the incidence of small-for-gestational age was 75% and low birthweight was 43%, supplementation with 30 mg zinc daily did not improve pregnancy outcomes. This is most likely due to the presence of other concurrent nutrient deficiencies. <LINK REF="STD-Peru-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peru 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bangladesh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bangladesh 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-USA-1995" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1995</LINK> studies attempted to assess the neurodevelopmental effect of zinc supplementation on infants. The inconsistencies in their results probably reflect the dependence of such outcomes on many variables.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-16 17:17:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The overall risk of bias was unclear in the half of the studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing the effects of zinc supplementation versus placebo/no intervention during pregnancy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The GRADE quality of the evidence was moderate for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, and low birthweight, downgraded by one level due to the fact that most studies had design limitations. Stillbirth or neonatal death, and birthweight were considered to be low quality of evidence, downgraded by two levels because of the design limitations and wide 95% CIs crossing the line of no effect.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-16 17:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Zinc is likely to be only one micronutrient in the overall picture of maternal nutrition prior to and during the course of pregnancy. Although the Cochrane review on micronutrient supplementation concludes that there is a reduction for low birthweight and small-for-gestational age with multiple-micronutrient supplements compared with iron folic acid supplementation, but there is no added benefit for preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2012</LINK>). In order to make any significant impact on morbidity and mortality, we really need to address the underlying problem of poor nutrition, due to low socioeconomic status (<LINK REF="STD-Peru-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Peru 1999</LINK>). Villar and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2003</LINK>) indicated that while zinc supplementation may be promising, they go on to say that "it is unlikely that any specific nutrient on its own ... will prevent .... preterm delivery or death during pregnancy".</P>
<P>Although improving birthweight, particularly in women from low-income countries is desirable, data from <LINK REF="STD-Nepal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nepal 2003</LINK> imply a degree of caution. In the overall <LINK REF="STD-Nepal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nepal 2003</LINK> study, multiple-micronutrient supplementation (but not other combinations of micronutrients) compared with controls was associated with more babies with a birthweight greater than 3.3 kg; and this high birthweight was associated with an increased risk of symptoms of birth asphyxia (risk ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.13).</P>
<P>Despite uncertainty about the effects of maternal zinc supplementation, many pharmaceutical companies have added zinc to their multivitamin preparations. <I>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>
</I>
<BR/>Lack of any significant benefit from zinc supplementation of mothers suggests that we should now not waste valuable resources looking at zinc in isolation. In addition, infant micronutrient supplementation (including zinc) may be more effective than maternal supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Lassi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shrimpton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrimpton 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Any future research aimed at improving outcomes related to maternal nutrition should address ways of modifying the overall nutritional status of pregnant women particularly in developing countries. This may not come from the scientific but from the political community where more resources need to be put into improving the overall socioeconomic status of impoverished populations and also to improve the status of the women in such populations. Future research should also address other interventions such as work reduction in populations of pregnant women at high risk of nutritional deficiency.</P>

<P>The 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily in studies of women of low income and this has some relevance in areas of high perinatal mortality. Some trials showed inconsistent findings, but overall, there is not enough evidence to show that routine zinc supplementation in women results in other clinically relevant outcomes.<BR/>

<P>There appeared to be inconsistency between trials regarding some pregnancy outcomes. The reduction in preterm birth needs further assessment probably in association with protein-calorie nutrition. Future research aimed at improving outcomes related to maternal nutrition should address ways of modifying the overall nutritional status of pregnant women particularly in low-income regions, but avoid looking at zinc in isolation. Future research should also address other interventions such as work reduction in populations of pregnant women at high risk of nutritional deficiency.</P>

Free transportation was provided daily to the clinic. At entry, each woman had a detailed medical and socioeconomic history, physical examination, assessment of the week of pregnancy by date of LMP and ultrasonic measurements. Serum levels of proteins, cholesterol, triglyceride, carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, calcium and magnesium were also measured. An experienced dietitian calculated dietary intake before starting the supplements from a 24-hour, quantitative, dietary recall history.
