<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The methodology has been updated to include risk of bias and summary of findings tables. The exercise interventions have been re-categorised which included reclassification of interventions from the original studies. The search was updated to include vibrations plates and included all studies up to Jan 2011. Of the 43 included studies 27 are new studies; and on further scrutiny of the included studies from the original version one was excluded and a further study was actually follow-up data for another included study. New comparisons are based on the reclassification of exercise categories. All analyses are new, based on the new categories of exercise interventions and the conclusions have changed.</P>

<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of exercise on bone mass in postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>
<B>The review shows that</B> <B>for postmenopausal women</B>

<B>What is osteoporosis and exercise</B>
</P>
<P>Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall.</P>
<P>Exercise interventions are typically those that stress or mechanically load bones (when bones support the weight of the body or when movement is resisted for example when using weights) and include aerobics, strength training, walking and tai chi.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-16 20:11:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Treatment of osteoporosis typically involves the use of pharmacological agents. In general it is thought that disuse (prolonged periods of inactivity) and unloading of the skeleton promotes reduced bone mass, whereas mechanical loading through exercise increases bone mass.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-03-23 06:01:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>To examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions in preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:25:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During the update of this review we updated the original search strategy by searching up to December 2010 the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> 2010 Issue 12); MEDLINE; EMBASE; HealthSTAR; Sports Discus; CINAHL; PEDro; Web of Science; Controlled Clinical Trials; and AMED. We attempted to identify other studies by contacting experts, searching reference lists and searching trial registers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:51:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our predetermined inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:54:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Pairs of members of the review team extracted the data and assessed trial quality using predetermined forms. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) of the percentage change from baseline. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic), we used a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-07 14:35:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Forty-three RCTs (27 new in this update) with 4320 participants met the inclusion criteria. The most effective type of exercise intervention on bone mineral density (BMD) for the neck of femur appears to be non-weight bearing high force exercise such as progressive resistance strength training for the lower limbs (MD 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.82). The most effective intervention for BMD at the spine was combination exercise programmes (MD 3.22; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.64) compared with control groups. Fractures and falls were reported as adverse events in some studies. There was no effect on numbers of fractures (odds ratio (OR) 0.61; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64). Overall, the quality of the reporting of studies in the meta-analyses was low, in particular in the areas of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-16 08:19:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Our results suggest a relatively small statistically significant, but possibly important, effect of exercise on bone density compared with control groups. Exercise has the potential to be a safe and effective way to avert bone loss in postmenopausal women.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-09 14:01:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:26:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:26:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1991</LINK>). The most common clinical manifestations of osteoporosis are fractures of the hip, vertebrae or wrist. Osteoporotic-related fractures are responsible for excess mortality, morbidity, chronic pain, reduction in quality of life, admission to long-term care and health and social care costs (<LINK REF="REF-Papaioannou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papaioannou 2010</LINK>). For women at the age of 50 years in developed countries, the remaining lifetime possibility of osteoporotic fractures exceeds 40%; the remaining lifetime probability for hip fracture alone exceeds 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Bessette-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bessette 2008</LINK>). The excess mortality associated with a hip fracture has been estimated to be 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1993</LINK>). The number of osteoporotic-related fractures is certain to increase as a result of the ageing population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevention of osteoporotic-related fractures is based on the ability to estimate fracture probability by means of risk factor assessment. The quality of bone, (the total characteristics of the bone that influence the bone&#8217;s resistance to fracture), is determined by a number of factors including bone geometry, cortical thickness and porosity, trabecular bone morphology and intrinsic properties of bony tissue.  Low bone mass, detected by bone densitometry, is one of the most important risk factors. Bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is reported to account for 60% to 70% of the variation in bone strength (<LINK REF="REF-Ammann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammann 2003</LINK>), and prospective studies have documented that the lifetime risk of an osteoporotic-related fracture increases 1.5 to 3 times with each standard deviation (SD) decrease in bone density (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1993</LINK>). However <LINK REF="REF-Zebaze-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zebaze 2010</LINK> reported that most bone loss is cortical, not trabecular, and occurs after the age of 65 years; and that the resulting structural decay, including the magnitude of intracortical remodelling and intracortical porosity, are poorly captured by current measurement methods. Although measurements of BMD contribute to the prediction of fracture risk they cannot identify individuals who will have a fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1996</LINK>) as many fractures, particularly in older populations, are results of falls which are influenced by environmental and other medical causes, e.g. impaired visual function, muscle strength and balance (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of hip fracture and the hospitalisation required following all types of fracture account for most of the economic costs associated with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1993</LINK>). Therefore, the prevention of fractures is the primary goal of intervention. See other Cochrane systematic reviews for pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis: alendronate (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008a</LINK>); etidronate (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008b</LINK>); fluoride (<LINK REF="REF-Haguenauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haguenauer 2004</LINK>); risedronate (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008c</LINK>); and strontium renalate (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:02:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Various exercise interventions, designed to stimulate bone growth and preserve bone mass have been described and evaluated. Interventions are typically those that stress or mechanically load bones (when bones support the weight of the body or when movement is resisted, for example when using weights) and include aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:02:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>In general, it is thought that disuse (not using the limbs or prolonged periods of inactivity) and unloading of the skeleton promotes reduced bone mass (<LINK REF="REF-Zerwekh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerwekh 1998</LINK>), whereas loading promotes increased bone mass. The effects of mechanical loading have been demonstrated in athletes undertaking high-impact exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Taaffe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taaffe 1997</LINK>) and in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Robling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robling 2002</LINK>). Mechanical loading through exercise has the potential to be a safe and effective way to avert or delay the onset of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Bonaiuti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonaiuti 2002</LINK>) concluded that exercise has beneficial effects on bone density of the hip and spine, although long term-studies including fracture data are rare. In addition, strength and balance exercises contribute to fracture risk reduction through their efficacy in reducing falls risk (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>The high prevalence and staggering costs (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2007</LINK>) of osteoporotic-related fractures in postmenopausal women means prevention and management of this disease is important. There continues to be much interest in the effects of exercise on bone as a nonpharmacological intervention. A systematic review is required to identify the number of new trials in this area and summarise the evidence for healthcare professionals, policy makers, researchers and others with an interest in this area.</P>

<P>Following an <I>a priori</I> protocol, at least two review authors (BS, TH, LD and FD) independently reviewed the eligibility criteria for abstracts for inclusion in this review. We screened all titles and/or abstracts generated by the searches for potentially relevant studies based on the following criteria: the type of study; type of participants; type of intervention; and type of outcome measurements. We assessed the full-length articles of the selected titles and/or abstracts for eligibility (for a full description see <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>).

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-06-07 14:47:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Pairs of members of the review team used a customised data extraction tool, tested prior to use, to independently extract data. We resolved disagreements by consensus or third-party adjudication. We attempted to contact authors of studies where there was inadequate reporting of data, to enable clarification and where appropriate, to allow pooling. Where available and appropriate, we presented quantitative data for the outcomes listed in the inclusion criteria in the analyses. Where studies reported standard errors (SEs) of the means, we obtained SDs by multiplying SEs of means by the square root of the sample size.</P>
<P>In order to assess efficacy, we extracted raw data for outcomes of interest (means and SDs for continuous outcomes and number of events for dichotomous outcomes) where available in the published reports. Wherever we converted or imputed reported data, we recorded this in the notes section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.

<P>We assessed risk of bias for each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Pairs of members of the review team reported the following six key domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and "other bias" (comparability of treatment and control group at entry, and appropriateness of duration of surveillance). In cases of disagreement between the review authors, we used consensus to make a decision. The final assessments for all included studies are presented in a 'risk of bias' table (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-09 13:32:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have summarised the data from 43 RCTs comparing exercise with usual activity and exercise plus pharmacological products versus pharmacological products. We also separately examined the effect of different categories of exercise.</P>
<P>Our results suggest a relatively small statistically significant, but possibly important, effect of exercise on bone density in postmenopausal women compared with control groups. The risk of fracture in exercise groups was not significantly different than that in controls (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64). Our inference is strengthened by the consistency of significant findings in favour of exercise for percentage change in BMD across three sites; spine (MD 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07); total hip (MD 0.41; 95% CI -0.64 to 1.45); and trochanter (MD 1.03; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49). This inference is, however, weakened by methodological limitations such as small sample sizes, loss to follow-up in most studies and by the unexplained heterogeneity of results across studies. Few studies provided follow-up data to determine the effect of exercise beyond the end of the intervention. Falls were reported as adverse events as numbers of falls rather than number of fallers; one study reported more events than people, indicating repeat falls. Other adverse events were reported for participants mainly in intervention groups and included muscle soreness, joint pain, headache and itching. There was generally no mention of event monitoring in control groups.</P>
<P>COMB exercise programmes (comprising more than one exercise type) had a significant effect on BMD at three sites: neck of femur; spine; and trochanter. The risk of fracture in exercise groups was lower than that of controls. However there was a significant difference in BMD in total hip measurement in favour of the control group.</P>
<P>DWBHF exercise (jogging, jumping and vibration platforms) had a significant effect on BMD at two sites; total hip and trochanter, compared to the control groups, but no effect at any other site (neck of femur, spine, mid femur, tibia, trunk and thighs, or BMC at neck of femur and spine).</P>
<P>DWBLF exercise (walking or Tai chi) had a significant effect on BMD at two sites; spine and wrist compared to the control groups.</P>
<P>NWBHF exercise (progressive resistance exercise) had a significant effect on BMD at two sites; neck of femur and spine compared to the control groups.</P>
<P>SWB exercise (e.g. single leg standing) had a significant effect on BMD at the hip.</P>
<P>NWBLF exercise (low load high repetition strength training) had no significant difference on any outcomes reported.</P>
<P>On the whole, comparisons of exercise plus pharmacological products versus pharmacological products were small single studies and thus conclusions on their findings are limited.</P>
<P>The population included in these studies was heterogeneous but results should be reviewed with caution due to differences in ethnicity. However, the lack of reporting of exercise characteristics (type, intensity, frequency, duration and mode) of the study exercise interventions also limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-07 15:13:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>It is important for future research in this area to have standardised recommendations for conducting exercise interventions and reporting of exercise outcomes. We cannot currently determine if the effect of the varied exercises was different in the first and in the second period of the postmenopausal time period. The short time of the follow-up of all the studies limits our ability to predict the long-term effects exercise may or may not have on bone loss.</P>

<P>The 43 studies (27 new studies in this update) included in this review were predominantly in the English language and originate mainly from North America and Europe (n = 32). Whilst this may be seen to limit the applicability of the evidence to these healthcare systems and social environments the evidence has potential generalisability; the majority of participants were healthy community-dwelling women.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the included studies was variable and should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this review. The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' for only 13 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergstrom-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bergstrom 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chilibeck-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chilibeck 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chubak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chubak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebrahim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ebrahim 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karinkanta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Karinkanta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korpelainen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Korpelainen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusi_x002d_Rasi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uusi-Rasi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verschueren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Verschueren 2004</LINK>). Only one study included in this review blinded the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2004</LINK>) and few blinded the assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Bocalini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bocalini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chilibeck-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chilibeck 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chubak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chubak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hatori-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hatori 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korpelainen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Korpelainen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preisinger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Preisinger 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinaki-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sinaki 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusi_x002d_Rasi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uusi-Rasi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verschueren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Verschueren 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is very difficult and maybe impossible to blind patients and care providers in exercise therapy. Nevertheless, this bias is unlikely to have influenced the BMD measurements.</P>

<P>The review was restricted to RCTs; we excluded clinical controlled trials CCTs) thus limiting the potential for bias. All studies described themselves as randomised mostly without giving details of how the randomisation sequence was generated and what precautions were taken in relation to concealment of allocation. Only eight studies adequately deal with incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Englund-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Englund 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karinkanta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Karinkanta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korpelainen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Korpelainen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metcalfe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Metcalfe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preisinger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Preisinger 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prince-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Prince 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusi_x002d_Rasi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uusi-Rasi 2003</LINK>) the remainder reporting the results for only those participants who completed all post-treatment assessments.

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-06-07 15:14:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>Few meta-analyses have been published in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hind-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hind 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 1999</LINK>). These meta-analyses included RCTs and CCTs, one (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 1999</LINK>) also included studies on premenopausal women. All authors subdivided the studies depending on the exercise characteristics and meta-analysed all exercise programmes together. While <LINK REF="REF-Wolff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 1999</LINK> concluded that exercises prevent femoral and lumbar bone loss, <LINK REF="REF-Berard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1997</LINK> concluded that weight bearing exercises are effective mainly on the spine, but there may be some evidence of efficacy on femoral bone and forearm bone. Weight bearing exercise also appears to enhance bone mineral accrual in children, particularly during early puberty (<LINK REF="REF-Hind-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hind 2007</LINK>). The results of a meta-analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Nikander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikander 2010</LINK> indicate that exercise can significantly enhance bone strength at loaded sites in children but not in adults.</P>
<P>Other reviews with limited quality evidence suggest that Tai chi (<LINK REF="REF-Wayne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wayne 2007</LINK>) and physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2009</LINK>) may be effective and safe methods of maintaining BMD in postmenopausal women. Furthermore an overview of the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Winett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winett 2001</LINK>) purports the benefits of resistance training on BMD. The results of this current review suggest that high force resistance training increases BMD whereas low force does not, indicating the importance of intensity of exercise.</P>
<P>This current review reported on bone mass as an outcome of effectiveness and included BMC, CaBI and BMD. <LINK REF="REF-Zebaze-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zebaze 2010</LINK> reported that most bone loss is cortical, not trabecular, and occurs after 65 years of age, and the resulting structural decay, including the magnitude of intracortical remodelling and intracortical porosity are poorly captured by current measurement methods. <LINK REF="REF-Nikander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikander 2010</LINK> recommends that further research is required to quantify the effects of exercise on whole bone strength and its structural determinants throughout life.</P>

<P>Our results suggest a relatively small statistically significant, but possibly important, effect of exercise on bone density in postmenopausal women compared with control groups. The most effective type of exercise intervention on BMD for the neck of femur appears to be NWBHF exercise such as progressive resistance strength training for the lower limbs. The most effective intervention for BMD at the spine was COMB exercise programmes (comprising more than one exercise type) (MD 3.22; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.64), with a change of over 3% compared with control groups. However the risk of fracture across all exercise groups was not significantly different than that in controls with 4 more women out of 100 who did not exercise sustaining a fracture (absolute difference 4%).</P>
<P>These exercise types should be considered as preferred interventions in clinical practice, however, it remains unclear as to what constitutes an optimal exercise programme.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-07 15:21:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey E Howe">
<P>On the whole the quality of the reporting of studies in the meta-analyses in this review was low, in particular in the areas of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up. Future research needs to focus on standardised outcome measures and exercise programmes, better reporting of all the parameters of exercise programmes and, the accuracy of measurements. Fracture and fall data, and adverse event reporting for all participants regardless of group allocation should be included for all future studies. Measuring the BMD changes for both the hip (particularly neck of femur) and spine is important as fractures at these sites result in high mortality and morbidity. Adequate follow-up of participants is required to determine long-term effects of exercise.</P>

<P>No HRT Exercise group <B>(DWBHF)</B> (n = 20): 5 circuit-training periods, each lasting 8 &#8211;10 weeks. These periods were interrupted by three high-impact aerobic dance periods, each of 2 week duration, and a summer pause for 5 weeks. Each session commenced with a 10 min warm-up period and concluded with stretching activities. During the first two circuit training periods, three rotations were performed of skipping (30 sec), bounding over soft hurdles (13&#8211;16 cm), drop jumping (10&#8211;15 cm), and hopping (on one leg 10 times, added during the second training period). The following three periods comprised four rotations of bounding (19&#8211;25 cm), drop jumping (20&#8211;25 cm), hopping (10 times per leg) and leaping (10 times). In addition, all circuit training sessions included 3 or 4 of the following resistance exercises for the upper body: chest fly, latissimus pull down, military press, seated row and biceps curl. The home exercise programme was also designed as a circuit training routine comprising three rotations of skipping (30 sec), hopping (10 times per leg) and drop jumping (15 cm). In addition, exercises to strengthen the abdominal and lower back region were included. Average GRF was 4.3 times body weight (BW) for drop-landing from a 10 cm height, and 5.2 times BW from 20 and 25 cm heights; bounding over the hurdles 4.9&#8211;5.1 BW, skipping, hopping, and leaping 3.8, 3.4, and 4.8 BW, respectively.</P>
