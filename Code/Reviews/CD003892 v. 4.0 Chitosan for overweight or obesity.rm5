<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-10 22:46:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Overweight and obesity are common health conditions worldwide but there are few effective treatments. Chitosan is a widely available dietary supplement that claims to aid weight loss and blood cholesterol levels. Fifteen studies which lasted between 4 to 24 weeks including a total of 1219 participants were analysed. Trials of chitosan to date have varied considerably in terms of quality. The review suggests that chitosan may have a small effect on body weight but results from high quality trials indicate that this effect is likely to be minimal.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:18:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chitosan, a deacetylated chitin, is a dietary supplement reported to decrease body weight. It is widely available over the counter worldwide and although evaluated in a number of trials its efficacy remains in dispute.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of chitosan as a treatment for overweight and obesity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-10 21:07:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, <I>The Cochrane Library)</I>, specialised web sites (Controlled Trials, IBIDS, SIGLE, Reuter's Health Service, Natural Alternatives International, Pharmanutrients), bibliographies of relevant journal articles, and contacted relevant authors and manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-10 21:26:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Trials were included in the review if they were randomised controlled trials of chitosan for a minimum of four weeks duration in adults who were overweight or obese. Authors of included studies were contacted for additional information where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Details from eligible trials were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardised data extraction form. Differences in data extraction were resolved by consensus. Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences and standard deviations. The pooled effect size was computed by using the inverse variance weighted method. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:18:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Fifteen trials including a total of 1219 participants met the inclusion criteria. No trial to date has measured the effect of chitosan on mortality or morbidity. Analyses indicated that chitosan preparations result in a significantly greater weight loss (weighted mean difference -1.7 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -1.3 kg, P &lt; 0.00001), decrease in total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/L [95% CI -0.3 to -0.1], P &lt; 0.00001), and a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo. There were no clear differences between intervention and control groups in terms of frequency of adverse events or in faecal fat excretion. However, the quality of many studies was sub-optimal and analyses restricted to studies that met allocation concealment criteria, were larger, or of longer duration showed that such trials produced substantially smaller decreases in weight and total cholesterol.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some evidence that chitosan is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of overweight and obesity. However, many trials to date have been of poor quality and results have been variable. Results obtained from high quality trials indicate that the effect of chitosan on body weight is minimal and unlikely to be of clinical significance. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-10 22:44:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-11 12:59:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Overweight and obesity are increasingly common health conditions globally. Obesity may be defined as the degree of fat storage associated with clearly elevated health risks. However, because fat mass is difficult to measure, the pragmatic definition of obesity is based upon body mass index (BMI). The World Health Organisation guidelines define a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> as normal, 25 to 29.9 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> as grade 1 overweight and greater than 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> as grade 2 overweight (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002c_-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO, 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overweight is increasingly prevalent in developed and developing populations (<LINK REF="REF-Flegal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flegal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>) and is an important contributor to cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rimm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimm 1995</LINK>) operating in part through effects of weight gain on blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1994</LINK>), blood lipids (<LINK REF="REF-Denke-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denke 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denke 1994</LINK>) and blood glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Grinker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grinker 2000</LINK>). Excess body weight is also associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1995</LINK>), osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Must--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Must 1999</LINK>) and several common cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Calle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 2001</LINK>), and in addition, it impairs health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 2001</LINK>). The non-fatal health problems associated with overweight include respiratory difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Naimark-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naimark 1960</LINK>), chronic musculoskeletal problems (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1992</LINK>), skin problems (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1997</LINK>) and infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Kirschner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirschner 1982</LINK>). Estimations of the burden of disease attributable to excess weight indicate that high body mass index (BMI) is a leading cause of loss of healthy life leading to 33 million disability adjusted life years (DALY) worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzati-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzati 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-11 12:58:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Intentional weight loss can reduce the mortality of overweight and obese people (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1999</LINK>), reduce the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sjostrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjostrom 1999</LINK>), serum total cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Poobalan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poobalan 2004</LINK>), and lead to improvements in health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1999</LINK>). Traditional methods of weight loss focus on reducing energy intake through reduced fat or calorie-controlled diets, increasing energy expenditure via an increase in physical activity, and behaviour modification. The effectiveness of these weight reduction methods is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Glenny-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douketis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douketis 1999</LINK>) with an overall pattern of moderate weight loss, followed by gradual weight regain. Numerous other weight management interventions are available, including surgery (for example liposuction, gastroplasty), vitamin and mineral supplements, meal replacements and pharmacological therapies. However, other than in the case of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sjostrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjostrom 1999</LINK>) the long term effectiveness of many of these interventions is unproven.</P>
<P>Pharmacological therapy as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle changes may improve long term weight loss. Pharmacological therapies currently approved for weight loss fall into two broad categories: those that decrease food intake by reducing appetite or increasing satiety (appetite suppressants) and those that decrease nutrient absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Yanovski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanovski 2002</LINK>). Examples of such treatments include sibutramine and orlistat. Sibutramine is a centrally acting re-uptake inhibitor of both norepinephrine and serotonin and results in decreased appetite, earlier satiety and a slight increase in energy expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Aronne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronne 1998</LINK>) while orlistat inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipases and thus decreases gastrointestinal uptake of dietary fat (<LINK REF="REF-Sjostrom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjostrom 1998</LINK>). However, both medications are expensive, have side effects (for example, dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, and headaches with sibutramine, and faecal urgency, flatulence and reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins with orlistat) and are contraindicated in many people.</P>
<P>Unlike pharmacological therapies, dietary supplements are not required to provide proof of safety or efficacy. A US survey estimated that 7% of the population use non-prescription weight loss supplements and such use is particularly common among young obese women (28%) (<LINK REF="REF-Blanck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanck 2001</LINK>). One such over-the-counter dietary supplement is chitosan, which is advertised and sold as a food supplement that lowers blood cholesterol concentration and aids weight loss. This supplement believed to reduce fat absorption is widely available and relatively inexpensive, and hence would offer many advantages if its effectiveness as a weight loss treatment were proven.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-10 22:45:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Chitosan, a partially deacetylated polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine derived from the polysaccharide chitin (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1997</LINK>) appears to bind to negatively charged lipids in animal trials, hence reducing their gastrointestinal uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Deuchi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deuchi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugano-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugano 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zacour-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacour 1992</LINK>) and lowering serum cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Nagyvary-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagyvary 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ormrod-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormrod 1998</LINK>). Some human trials have suggested that chitosan may decrease body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Schiller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schiller 2001</LINK>) and a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>) suggested a 3.3 kg greater weight loss with chitosan compared with placebo. However, other studies have found no effect of chitosan on body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pittler 1999</LINK>). Several chitosan studies have been published since the 1998 meta-analysis, the results of which have been variable with some indicating a positive effect on weight and some demonstrating no effect. In order resolve the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of this dietary supplement (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1999</LINK>) this Cochrane review aims to summarise systematically all of the available evidence on the effectiveness of chitosan as a weight loss treatment.</P>

<P>Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD) and standard deviations (SD) where possible and summarised statistically. The pooled effect size was computed by using the inverse variance weighted method.</P>
<P>Where there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity the results were pooled statistically using a fixed-effects approach. Otherwise a random-effects approach was also used as a sensitivity analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was tested for using the Q statistic devised by Cochran with significance being set at P &lt; 0.10, because tests of statistical heterogeneity are known to have low power. Quantification of the effect of heterogeneity was assessed by means of I<SUP>2</SUP>, which ranges from 0% to 100%, and has associated 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).

All 15 studies included body weight as an outcome measure but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wuolijoki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wuolijoki 1999</LINK>) did not report the results except in the form of a figure, which meant the mean weight change and the associated standard deviation over time could not be derived. Ten studies reported results for total blood cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girola-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Girola 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaats-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaats 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ni-Mhurchu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ni Mhurchu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pittler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veneroni-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veneroni 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wuolijoki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wuolijoki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zahorska_x002d_Markiewicz" TYPE="STUDY">Zahorska-Markiewicz</LINK>) with a slightly smaller number reporting results for the lipid sub fractions LDL cholesterol (8), HDL cholesterol (8), and triglycerides (8). Seven studies reported results for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Giustina-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giustina 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ni-Mhurchu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ni Mhurchu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pittler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sciutto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sciutto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodgate-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodgate 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zahorska_x002d_Markiewicz" TYPE="STUDY">Zahorska-Markiewicz</LINK>). Fourteen trials measured and reported adverse events (side effects and/or fat-soluble vitamin levels and/or blood chemistry) but one did not provide any quantitative data (<LINK REF="STD-Sciutto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sciutto 1995</LINK>). One trial did not report adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Kaats-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaats 2006</LINK>). Two studies examined treatment effects on faecal fat (<LINK REF="STD-Ni-Mhurchu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ni Mhurchu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schiller 2001</LINK>) but both used different units of measurement (mmol versus grams). No studies measured effects on HbA1 or on costs. All studies measured outcomes post-intervention only, i.e. without extended follow-up beyond the end of the intervention periods.</P>
<P>For one study endpoint data were provided only in the form of mean difference between baseline and endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-Kaats-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaats 2006</LINK>). Additional data for abstraction were provided by the author (personal communication, Gilbert Kaats). For several of the studies, additional calculations were necessary in order to transform the available data into a format suitable for inclusion in the review. Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giustina-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giustina 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pittler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schiller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veneroni-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veneroni 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodgate-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodgate 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zahorska_x002d_Markiewicz" TYPE="STUDY">Zahorska-Markiewicz</LINK>) presented results at baseline and follow-up but did not present change over time so we used the baseline mean and standard deviation (SD) and the follow-up mean and SD to compute change over time. The mean change was computed as the (follow-up mean - baseline mean) within the study and the SD for change was found from sqrt (((nb-1) sd^2(b) - (nf-1) sd^2(f))/(N-2)) where nb is the number of participants at baseline, nf is the number of participants at follow-up, sd(b) is the sd at baseline, sd(f) is the sd at follow-up, and N= nf+nb. Unpublished data were provided by one author (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2001</LINK>) enabling the necessary calculations since the published results were only reported stratified by sex (see<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details). Mean change over time and SD were calculated from published individual patient data in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Macchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macchi 1996</LINK>), and although data were available for three intervention groups (chitosan alone versus chitosan plus diet versus placebo plus diet) only data from two intervention groups (chitosan plus diet versus placebo plus diet) were included in the review. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sciutto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sciutto 1995</LINK>) published cumulative changes over a period of four weeks so these were summed to estimate overall change over time and SD. One study did not provide data in a form suitable for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Girola-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Girola 1996</LINK>) because results were reported as percentage change over time so a standard deviation could not be calculated. Repeated attempts were made to contact Girola et al but were unsuccessful.</P>
<P>Since none of the studies reported primary outcomes (mortality, morbidity, quality of life) it was decided it would be inappropriate to do sub-group analyses since the chance of obtaining a spurious result was high. Sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the overall findings were performed.<BR/>

<P>The process of concealing randomised study assignments is known as allocation concealment and when studies do not report any concealment approach, adequacy is considered unclear. Studies reporting appropriate methods of allocation concealment are considered "A grade" trials. Studies where the method of allocation concealment is unclear are considered "B grade". Using an appropriate method to prevent foreknowledge of treatment assignment is crucially important in preventing bias and distorting treatment comparisons and, as such, it is recommended that allocation concealment is used as a key method of measuring study quality (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). Although all studies included in the review were randomised the method of allocation concealment was unclear for all but three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ni-Mhurchu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ni Mhurchu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pittler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pittler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schiller 2001</LINK>), meaning that the quality of the remaining 12 studies could not be determined satisfactorily.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-11 12:26:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>This review examined the efficacy of chitosan as a weight loss treatment. Combining data from all trials that provided data on body weight suggests that chitosan may be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because the results were sensitive to several indicators of study quality including allocation concealment, study duration, study size, and the use of treatments that included active agents other than chitosan.</P>
<P>Limitation of analyses to those trials that met the allocation concealment criteria suggested an estimated mean weight difference of -0.6 kg (95% CI -1.3 to 0.10) between people taking chitosan verus placebo (P = 0.09). This mean weight difference of approximately half a kilogram achieved over trial periods ranging from four weeks to six months is minimal and therefore unlikely to be of clinical significance. The effect of chitosan on total cholesterol levels was similarly reduced when analyses were restricted to studies that met the allocation concealment criteria (-0.15 mmol/L (95% CI -0.23 to -0.07)) but remained statistically significant (P = 0.0004) although its clinical significance is also questionable. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that trials of longer duration and larger size produced smaller effects, as did trials where the intervention treatment was limited to chitosan alone (i.e. unadulterated with other active weight loss agents).</P>
<P>Several small studies reported surprisingly small standard deviations associated with changes in outcomes. Three studies in particular had sample sizes of only 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Macchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macchi 1996</LINK>), 27 (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1998</LINK>), and 88 (<LINK REF="STD-Sciutto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sciutto 1995</LINK>) and yet reported standard deviations for weight change that were less than those reported in a trial involving 250 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ni-Mhurchu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ni Mhurchu 2004</LINK>). This suggests either remarkably homogeneous sample populations or a data error. As the weight allocated to each study is inversely proportional to their precision these small trials (with apparent high precision) were awarded more weight in the summary analyses and thus had a large influence on the combined estimate.</P>
<P>A previous meta-analysis of chitosan as a treatment for body weight reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>) found a mean difference in terms of weight reduction between chitosan and placebo groups of 3.3 kg (95% CI 1.5 to 5.1), which is considerably greater than that found in this review. However, the meta-analysis by Ernst and Pittler (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>) was based on only five Italian studies published in 1995 and 1996 (<LINK REF="STD-Giustina-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Giustina 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sciutto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sciutto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macchi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macchi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veneroni-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veneroni 1996</LINK>) and since then many additional studies of chitosan have been published, ten of which have been included in this review. Ernst and Pittler expressed concerns about the possibility of a systematic bias in the studies included in their meta-analysis because they were all supplied by one manufacturer, were similar in design, and appeared in the same Italian journal. It is worth noting that these five studies consistently demonstrated the greatest effects in this review, did not meet the allocation concealment criteria, were all of short duration, and four of them also included other agents in their chitosan preparations. As a result, these studies were excluded from many of the sensitivity analyses, thus partly explaining the smaller effects seen in the restricted analyses. Correspondence with the authors of these studies was unsuccessful and therefore, these issues remain unresolved.</P>
<P>Limitations of the review include the exclusion of some potentially informative trials where trial participants were selected for criteria other than being overweight or obese (<LINK REF="STD-Ausar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ausar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bokura" TYPE="STUDY">Bokura</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guha-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Guha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaats-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kaats 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 2000</LINK>) and thus did not meet the criteria for this review. In addition, the small number of studies included in the review and the sensitivity of results to several indicators of study quality suggest that the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In summary, this review has indicated that chitosan may be an effective aid to weight loss but many of the included trials have been limited by poor methodology and reporting. Therefore, caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings of the review and further high quality trials are required in order to evaluate appropriately its effectiveness as a weight loss agent.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-08 12:21:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that chitosan is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of overweight and obesity. However, many of the included trials to date have been of poor quality. Results obtained from high quality trials indicate that the effect of chitosan on body weight is minimal and unlikely to be of clinical significance.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-11 12:28:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The quality of trials of chitosan and reporting of trial methodology has been generally poor. Recommendations for future studies of chitosan are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>To conduct longer term trials: 24 weeks should be the minimum duration for a weight loss trial.</LI>
<LI>To measure important outcomes including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life.</LI>
<LI>To describe in detail the composition and dose of chitosan used.</LI>
<LI>To report trial methodology more comprehensively, particularly in relation to methods of randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>To conduct intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses in order to account for any loss to follow-up following randomisation.</LI>
<LI>To incorporate economic evaluations into future trials.</LI>
