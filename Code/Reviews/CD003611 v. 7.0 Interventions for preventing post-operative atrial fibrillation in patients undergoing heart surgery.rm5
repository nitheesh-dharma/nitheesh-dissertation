<P>Increased evidence has lead to an improved estimated efficacy for both amiodarone and atrial pacing in preventing atrial fibrillation. Though the summary estimate for all interventions in relation to stroke still did not reach statistical significance, it is clearer from this updated review that there is a trend towards the protective effects of prophylaxis. Finally, additional evidence allowed this review to confirm the hypothesis of the previous version's authors that intervention in this setting leads to a decreased cost of hospital stay.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:47:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atrial fibrillation after heart surgery is a common complication that has been associated with poor outcomes. We reviewed the literature to better understand the role of preventative interventions for this condition. By combining the results of 118 studies with 17,364 participants, we are able to gain a better understanding of the evidence behind each of these interventions. All of the interventions studied were effective in reducing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, length of hospital stay, cost of hospital treatment and may be effective in reducing the risk of stroke. The interventions did not have an effect on death after heart surgery. It was not possible to analyze the adverse events associated with the medications studied in this review, but these should be considered by clinicians when choosing an appropriate intervention for their patients. Furthermore, differences in the design between the studies combined in this review may complicate interpretation of these results.</P>

<P>Atrial fibrillation is a common post-operative complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of post-operative stroke, increased length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, healthcare costs and mortality. Numerous trials have evaluated various pharmacological and non-pharmacological prophylactic interventions for their efficacy in preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation. We conducted an update to a 2004 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-10-25 21:15:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to assess the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia after cardiac surgery. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects on post-operative stroke or cerebrovascular accident, mortality, cardiovascular mortality, length of hospital stay and cost of treatment during the hospital stay.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:47:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One hundred and eighteen studies with 138 treatment groups and 17,364 participants were included in this review. Fifty-seven of these studies were included in the original version of this review while 61 were added, including 27 on interventions that were not considered in the original version. Interventions included amiodarone, beta-blockers, sotalol, magnesium, atrial pacing and posterior pericardiotomy. Each of the studied interventions significantly reduced the rate of post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery compared with a control. Beta-blockers (odds ratio (OR) 0.33; 95% confidence interval) CI 0.26 to 0.43; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 55%) and sotalol (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.43; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 3%) appear to have similar efficacy while magnesium's efficacy (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 51%) may be slightly less. Amiodarone (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63%), atrial pacing (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 50%) and posterior pericardiotomy (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.67; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66%) were all found to be effective. Prophylactic intervention decreased the hospital length of stay by approximately two-thirds of a day and decreased the cost of hospital treatment by roughly $1250 US. Intervention was also found to reduce the odds of post-operative stroke, though this reduction did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). No significant effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality was demonstrated.</P>

<P>Prophylaxis to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery with any of the studied pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions may be favored because of its reduction in the rate of atrial fibrillation, decrease in the length of stay and cost of hospital treatment and a possible decrease in the rate of stroke. However, this review is limited by the quality of the available data and heterogeneity between the included studies. Selection of appropriate interventions may depend on the individual patient situation and should take into consideration adverse effects and the cost associated with each approach.</P>

<P>Atrial fibrillation is a common post-operative complication of cardiac surgery, occurring in 17% to 47% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Almassi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almassi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frost-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frost 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leitch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitch 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1996</LINK>) with the incidence being greater in older patients (<LINK REF="REF-Leitch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leitch 1990</LINK>). Besides directly causing patient discomfort and leading to hemodynamic compromise, several studies have demonstrated that post-operative atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of post-operative stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Almassi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almassi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creswell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reed-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1998</LINK>) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Almassi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almassi 1997</LINK>), longer intensive care unit and hospital stays (<LINK REF="REF-Almassi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almassi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aranki-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aranki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creswell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loubani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loubani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1996</LINK>) and greater costs of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kowey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kowey 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1990</LINK>). Atrial fibrillation, both paroxysmal and chronic, has been shown to significantly increase the risk of stroke, especially in older patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1991</LINK>).The main mechanism of stroke in atrial fibrillation is believed to be intracardiac embolism. Blood stasis within the atrial chamber likely plays a role, but continuing research has identified multiple other factors that lead to thrombus formation (<LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 2009</LINK>), including: atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-SPAF-Investigators-Committee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF Investigators Committee 1998</LINK>), a pro-inflammatory state, and endothelial dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Guazzi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guazzi 2009</LINK>), as well as platelet activation (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 2002</LINK>) that leads to a hypercoagulable state (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2009</LINK>). With the low rate and multifactorial etiology of post-operative stroke after cardiac surgery, it is difficult for any single trial to definitively demonstrate a benefit from atrial fibrillation prevention. Prophylaxis for post-operative atrial fibrillation is a common practice in the cardiac surgery population and aims to prevent the complications and outcomes discussed above.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:47:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous trials have studied various interventions for their efficacy in preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2000b</LINK>). These interventions fall into one of two categories: pharmacological or non-pharmacological. The most commonly studied prophylactic interventions to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery are beta-blockers, including atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and timolol, among others. This class of drugs works by blocking the effects of catecholamines on &#946;<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenergic receptors, thus decreasing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart. Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic, has also been studied extensively in this setting. This agent primarily prolongs the repolarization phase of the cardiac cycle by blocking potassium channels. However, it also has other effect similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Sotalol demonstrates properties of both Class III antiarrhythmics and beta-blockers. Finally, magnesium has been proposed as a prophylactic measure for atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery and is thought to work through its effects on transmembrane ion gradients and catecholamines. Studies investigating non-pharmacological interventions for preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation have largely concentrated on atrial pacing, which controls the heart rate via electrical stimulation. However, posterior pericardiotomy, an intraoperative procedure that involves a 4 cm longitudinal incision in the pericardium posterior and parallel to the phrenic nerve, has also been evaluated. This technique is thought to work by allowing post-operative drainage of fluid and blood out of the pericardium, thereby preventing pericardial effusion, a condition known to be associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-Angelini-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelini 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bryan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 1990</LINK>). Each of these interventions are associated with adverse effects that range from abnormal laboratory tests to hemodynamic instability. Knowledge of these possible adverse effects and the methods to address them are important skills for the clinician offering post-operative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis, as they may have important clinical consequences for this vulnerable patient population. While an in-depth discussion of the safety and monitoring of each of these interventions is beyond the scope of this review, the most common and most serious potential adverse events for each of these interventions are outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:47:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many studies have investigated various proposed prophylactic interventions for their efficacy in preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. However, few of these trials have been sufficiently powered to definitively determine the usefulness of these treatments in preventing this arrhythmia. Furthermore, no studies have had sufficient power to reliably estimate the effects of these treatments on the rates of clinically relevant outcomes such as stroke, mortality and the length and cost of hospital stay. This is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Crystal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crystal 2004</LINK>). Since that date, a number of studies have been published that further evaluate the major interventions considered and re-explore interventions that were not included in the original review. We updated this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of various interventions for preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery and for their effects on stroke, mortality, cardiovascular mortality, length of hospital stay and cost of treatment.</P>

<P>Any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention aimed at preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation except digoxin, potassium (K<SUP>+</SUP>), or steroids. Digoxin is mainly used for its rate-control properties and therefore was not deemed to be important in this analysis of rhythm-control prophylaxis. While hypokalemia is an important factor in the generation of atrial fibrillation, its use is guided mainly by plasma levels and clinical decision-making rather than specific use for post-operative prophylaxis. Interest in steroids in the cardiac surgery setting has increased in recent years. We decided not to include steroids in this review because there have been several extensive reviews of this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Cappabianca-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappabianca 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marik-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marik 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 2008</LINK>) and our literature search did not reveal any studies that would significantly add to the established review literature.

<P>Thirty-three of the studies included in this review, with a total of 5402 participants, evaluated the effect of amiodarone on post-operative atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia. Dosing regimens, including loading doses and infusion rates, varied between studies and were delivered both orally and intravenously. Approximately half of the studies began amiodarone administration pre-operatively and half post-operatively. <LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_rge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dörge 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK> each contained two separate treatment groups. The former utilized a high- and a low-dose group while the groups in the latter differed by the rate of the loading dose. Amiodarone was associated with a significant reduction in post-operative atrial fibrillation in the treatment group (19.4%) compared with the control group (33.3%) (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 63%; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>)</P>

Each of these groups were based on an alternate pacing location except for those in <LINK REF="STD-Hakala-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hakala 2005</LINK>, which were both right atrial pacing but differed in the target heart rate algorithms. There were 32 treatment groups in total, including three Bachmann's bundle pacing, 13 biatrial pacing, four left atrial pacing, 10 right atrial pacing, one triple-site atrial pacing and one not specified. The incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation across all studies was 18.7% in the treatment group and 32.8% in the control group, a difference that was statistically significant (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 50%; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">The effect of interventions on post-operative stroke and cerebrovascular accident</HEADING>
<P>To determine if prophylactic treatment to prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation has a substantial effect on post-operative stroke, we collected all available data regarding this outcome from the studies included in this review. Twenty-eight studies with 34 treatment groups and 6361 participants provided data on the number of strokes. No patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1987</LINK> study suffered a stroke and therefore this study did not contribute to the overall pooled summary estimate. Follow-up for stroke was identical to follow-up for atrial fibrillation in all studies. Only <LINK REF="STD-Auer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Auer 2004</LINK> specifically defined this outcome and required confirmation by brain computed tomography. Considering all interventions together, prophylactic treatment was associated with a borderline significant reduction in post-operative atrial fibrillation in the treatment group (1.5%) compared to the control group (2.3%) (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).

Interventions were associated with a significant reduction in length of stay in the treatment group, demonstrated by a mean difference of -0.69 days (95% CI -0.95 to -0.43). All individual interventions were associated with similar significant or borderline significant reductions except for magnesium.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Considerable heterogeneity was found in the primary outcome analyses for each of the reviewed interventions, except for sotalol (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 3%). However, much of this heterogeneity may be explained by primary trial characteristics.</P>
<P>In the amiodarone analysis, difference in treatment regimens between the studies, including dosages and timing of initial administration, likely contributed substantially to the heterogeneity. When considering only studies that began administration of amiodarone post-operatively, heterogeneity was numerically decreased (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 37%).</P>
<P>A source of heterogeneity in the beta-blocker analysis may have been the type of beta-blocker used. When considering only studies evaluating the effects of propranolol, only 18% of the variation between studies was found to be due to heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The pooled analysis of trials studying the efficacy of magnesium demonstrate borderline significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 51%). Treatment regimens varied from small doses added to the cardioplegia solution to continuous infusions over several days and possibly accounted for a large part of this variance.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity in the atrial pacing analysis may have been due to the pooling of studies utilizing different pacing methods, including Bachmann's bundle pacing, left atrial pacing, right atrial pacing and biatrial pacing.</P>
<P>Due to the small number of trials contained in the analysis of posterior pericardiotomy for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation, much of the heterogeneity found in this analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66%) was due to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Asimakopoulos-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asimakopoulos 1997</LINK>). This study differed from the others investigating this intervention in its definition of the primary outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Asimakopoulos-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asimakopoulos 1997</LINK> considered all instances of supraventricular tachycardia while the other studies in this analysis specified the primary outcome as incidence of atrial fibrillation or set a minimum duration required for the event to be considered.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:50:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This meta-analysis demonstrated that each of the studied interventions significantly reduced the rate of post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery compared with a placebo control. Beta-blockers and sotalol appeared to have similar efficacy. Amiodarone, atrial pacing and posterior pericardiotomy were found to be effective. However, the summary estimate for the latter was based on only six trials. The ability of magnesium to prevent atrial fibrillation may be slightly less than that of the other pharmacological agents.</P>
<P>Prophylactic intervention of any kind in this setting appeared to reduce the odds of post-operative stroke, though this reduction did not reach statistical significance. Intervention also decreased the hospital length of stay by approximately two-thirds of a day and decreased the cost of hospital treatment by roughly $1250 US. There was insufficient evidence to appropriately compare the efficacy of the individual interventions for these secondary outcomes. However, it is important to note that magnesium and posterior pericardiotomy were not associated with a decreased length of hospital stay. With regards to the latter, this can possibly be explained by other positive effects of alternate interventions, including influencing hemodynamic stability, that are not benefits of posterior pericardiotomy. Atrial pacing was not associated with a decrease in the cost of hospital treatment, possibly due to the equipment costs associated with this intervention.</P>
<P>None of the interventions demonstrated a significant protective effect against post-operative all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis was primarily limited by the lack of availability of relevant secondary outcome data. The incidence of stroke, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, as well as length of hospital stay and cost of hospital treatment were not collected in many of the included studies. Further, this review is limited by the quality of the available studies. Improper allocation concealment, lack of blinding within pharmacological trials, selective reporting and failure to utilize an intention-to-treat analysis were all associated with variation in the pooled summary estimates for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation. Although the results of sensitivity analyses based on the level of risk demonstrated some numerical differences, these adjusted results would not influence the overall implications of this review. Though many of the analyses in this review demonstrated significant heterogeneity, much of this variance may be explained by individual study characteristics that can be taken into account when applying the results of this review in the clinical setting. This review was not designed or powered to evaluate drug dosage or timing of interventions, which varied considerably between studies. Consensus on these factors through further research or more detailed analysis of data specific to these questions is warranted.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:50:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review sought to update the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Crystal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crystal 2004</LINK>) with the available evidence from the seven years since its publication. In addition, the interventions of magnesium and posterior pericardiotomy were included due to their significant presence within the literature. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis are largely similar to those of the previous version. Increased evidence has lead to an improved estimated efficacy for both amiodarone and atrial pacing in preventing atrial fibrillation. Though the summary estimate for all interventions in relation to stroke still did not reach statistical significance, it is clearer from this updated review that there is a trend towards the protective effects of prophylaxis. The estimated reduction in hospital length of stay due to preventative intervention was nearly identical in the two versions of this review. Finally, additional evidence allowed this review to confirm the hypothesis of the previous version's authors that intervention in this setting leads to a decreased cost of hospital stay.</P>
<P>Since the publication of the previous version of this meta-analysis, a number of studies have reviewed the state of the literature surrounding this topic. However, few have done so in a systematic fashion. The most recent complete systematic review of this literature evaluated each of the pharmacological interventions we considered in this paper, as well as atrial pacing, digoxin and calcium-channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2006</LINK>). Our updated results are in agreement with those presented in this previous review.</P>
<P>A more recent analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2008</LINK>) summarized the efficacy of magnesium for preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation after CABG. The authors reported a pooled odds ratio in a random-effects model of 14 studies of 0.61 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.90). Our summary estimate was similar.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of posterior pericardiotomy in this setting retrieved the same six studies identified in our search and presented a nearly identical pooled summary estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Biancari-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biancari 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical research has also focused on the use of steroids to decrease post-operative mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery, including for prevention of atrial fibrillation. This class of drugs was not studied within this meta-analysis because several recent extensive reviews are readily available. <LINK REF="REF-Cappabianca-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappabianca 2011</LINK> reported in a review of 31 randomized trials that steroids were associated with a pooled odds ratio of 0.56 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.72) for atrial fibrillation, a result comparable to those of the interventions studied in this review.</P>

<P>Recent guidelines from both Canadian (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2011</LINK>) and American (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2005</LINK>) expert groups have suggested that beta-blockers be adopted for routine prophylactic use following cardiac surgery to prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation in both patients regularly taking this type of medication at home and those not. In patients where the use of beta-blockers is contraindicated, amiodarone is considered to be the second choice. Due largely to possible adverse effects, sotalol is only recommended by these guidelines in patients at high risk of atrial fibrillation (e.g. the elderly, valvular surgery patients or those with congestive heart disease) (<LINK REF="REF-Shirzad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shirzad 2010</LINK>). The more recent Canadian guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2011</LINK>) state that magnesium and atrial pacing may be beneficial, but are only recommended if the patient has contraindications for both beta-blockers and amiodarone. This review largely supports these guidelines. Each of these interventions demonstrated strong efficacy in preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation. The selection of prophylaxis should reflect the individual patient's condition and take into account the risks and adverse events associated with each intervention. While the studies analyzed in this review were generally not powered to evaluate the adverse effects of each of the interventions and there was no standardized method of reporting these events, the known risks associated with each of the interventions are outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. These interventions should be administered by health professionals familiar with their use and with the assessment for and treatment of potential complications. The evidence presented in this review on posterior pericardiotomy is based on only a few randomized trials. Therefore, although it demonstrated promising results, we cannot recommend use of this surgical prophylactic intervention at this time.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-05 14:50:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review presents evidence that post-operative atrial fibrillation can be reduced by several interventions with different mechanism of actions, for example, beta-blockers via catecholamine pathways and posterior pericardiotomy through diminution of cardiac irritation by blood. Further research should consider examining synergism between interventions for greater efficacy.</P>
<P>This review also demonstrates that intervention for preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation leads to a decreased hospital length of stay, lower costs of hospital treatment and a trend towards decreased risk of post-operative stroke. However, these data were unavailable from a number of the trials included in this review. Future studies should make note to properly collect and present these data as conclusive evidence of the beneficial effects of prophylactic intervention beyond the direct prevention of atrial fibrillation would be beneficial.</P>
<P>Finally, continued investigation into the physiological mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and especially the circumstances that lead to thrombus formation during this arrhythmia would benefit future research and lead to greater understanding of how to prevent this outcome.</P>
