Upon further review, 24 were excluded as patients were either not randomized to treatment or the studies included patients who were not incontinent . Of the remaining 18 reports, 6 were additional publications of already included studies (Milani 85, Demirci 2001, Ward 2002), 6 were follow up reports of previously included studies (Sand 2000, Mak 2000, Corcos 2001, Ward 2002), and 6 were citations of protocols of ongoing randomized trials (Boyd 1996; Brubaker 2003; Bump 2002; MRC Colpo Trial; Tincello 2004). Six new trials were identified for inclusion into this review update (Ankardal 2001, Koelbl 2002, Liapis 2002, O'Sullivan 2000, Osman 2003, Wang 2003).<BR/>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified 123 reports of 69 studies that used open retropubic colposuspension in at least one arm and apparently met the review criteria. Of the 69 studies, 33 were included, 25 were excluded and 11 are awaiting assessment, pending confirmation from the authors on the random allocation of the participants. Of the 25 trials that were excluded, the majority were either not randomised trials or had participants that were not incontinent at the beginning of the trial. Two references were studies done comparing one sling technique with another (Debodinance 1993; Debodinance 1994). One trial (Baessler 1998) was excluded because it compared one technique of open retropubic colposuspension (Burch) with the same technique in combination with another (paravaginal repair). Hence, the review includes 33 trials.<BR/>

<U>Importance of the Review / Background</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence is losing urine when coughing, laughing, sneezing or exercising. It can be caused by changes to muscles and ligaments holding up the bladder. Mixed urinary incontinence is also losing urine when there is an urge to void as well as when coughing and laughing. Muscle-strengthening exercises can help, and there are surgical procedures to improve support or correct problems. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence. Open retropubic colposuspension is an operation which involves lifting the tissues around the junction between the bladder and the urethra.</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Main Findings</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>The review of trials found that this is an effective surgical technique for stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women, resulting in long-term cure for most women. It provides better cure rates compared to anterior colporrhaphy a (suturing of the top wall of the vagina) and needle suspension surgery (passing a needle with sutures at the sides of the urethra to lift up the tissues beside it).New techniques, particularly sling operations (including the use of tapes to lift up the urethra)and keyhole (laparoscopic) colposuspension, look promising but need further research particularly on long-term performance. Procedures involving surgery to insert a tape under the urethra showed better cure rates in the medium and long term, compared to open colposuspension. In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that open retropubic colposuspension would be cheaper than laparoscopic colposuspension, but more expensive than tension-free vaginal tape (TVT).</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Adverse Events</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>Laparoscopic colposuspension allows for faster recovery compared to open colposuspension. Studies did not reveal a higher complication rate with open colposuspension compared with the other surgical techniques, although pelvic organ prolapse was found to be more common. Abnormal voiding was less common after open colposuspension compared to sling surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Limitations</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>Limited information was available on the long term adverse events of open colposuspension and its effect on the quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is a common and potentially debilitating problem. Stress urinary, incontinence as the most common type of incontinence, imposes significant health and economic burdens on society and the women affected. Open retropubic colposuspension is a surgical treatment which involves lifting the tissues near the bladder neck and proximal urethra in the area behind the anterior pubic bones to correct deficient urethral closure to correct stress urinary incontinence.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-12 10:26:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 55 trials involving a total of 5417 women.</P>
<P>Overall cure rates were 68.9% to 88.0% for open retropubic colposuspension. Two small studies suggested lower incontinence rates after open retropubic colposuspension compared with conservative treatment. Similarly, one trial suggested lower incontinence rates after open retropubic colposuspension compared to anticholinergic treatment. Evidence from six trials showed a lower incontinence rate after open retropubic colposuspension than after anterior colporrhaphy. Such benefit was maintained over time (risk ratio (RR) for incontinence 0.46; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72 before the first year, RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.51 at one to five years, RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.75 in periods beyond five years).</P>
<P>Evidence from 22 trials in comparison with suburethral slings (traditional slings or trans-vaginal tape or transobturator tape) found no overall significant difference in incontinence rates in all time periods evaluated (as assessed subjectively RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.18, within one year of treatment, RR 1.18; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.39 between one and five years, RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27 at five years and more, and as assessed objectively RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67 within one year of treatment, RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54 for one to five years follow up, RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.64 at more than five years). However, subgroup analysis of studies comparing traditional slings and open colposuspension showed better effectiveness with traditional slings in the medium and long term (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64 from one to five years follow up, RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37).</P>
<P>In comparison with needle suspension, there was a lower incontinence rate after colposuspension in the first year after surgery (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03), after the first year (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81), and beyond five years (RR 0.32; 95% CI 15 to 0.71).</P>
<P>Patient-reported incontinence rates at short, medium and long-term follow-up showed no significant differences between open and laparoscopic retropubic colposuspension, but with wide confidence intervals. In two trials incontinence was less common after the Burch (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76) than after the Marshall Marchetti Krantz procedure at one to five year follow-up. There were few data at any other follow-up times.</P>
<P>In general, the evidence available does not show a higher morbidity or complication rate with open retropubic colposuspension compared to the other open surgical techniques, although pelvic organ prolapse is more common than after anterior colporrhaphy and sling procedures. Voiding problems are also more common after sling procedures compared to open colposuspension.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:46:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Open retropubic colposuspension is an effective treatment modality for stress urinary incontinence especially in the long term. Within the first year of treatment, the overall continence rate is approximately 85% to 90%. After five years, approximately 70% of women can expect to be dry. Newer minimal access sling procedures look promising in comparison with open colposuspension but their long-term performance is limited and closer monitoring of their adverse event profile must be carried out. Open colposuspension is associated with a higher risk of pelvic organ prolapse compared to sling operations and anterior colporrhaphy, but with a lower risk of voiding dysfunction compared to traditional sling surgery. Laparoscopic colposuspension should allow speedier recovery but its relative safety and long-term effectiveness is not yet known. A Brief Economic Commentary (BEC) identified five studies suggesting that tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and laparoscopic colposuspension may be more cost-effective compared with open retropubic colposuspension.</P>

<P>Urinary incontinence has been identified by the World Health Organization as an important global health issue. It is a common and potentially debilitating problem. The overall prevalence of incontinence is reported to be between 10% to 40% of adult women, and is considered severe in about 3% to 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2002</LINK>). The wide range of prevalence estimates is due to variations in the definition of incontinence used, populations sampled, and study methods (<LINK REF="REF-Herzog-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herzog 1990</LINK>). It is believed that the true magnitude of the problem is still unknown due to under-reporting.</P>
<P>Continence is achieved through an interplay of the normal anatomical and physiological properties of the bladder, urethra and sphincter, pelvic floor, and the nervous system co-ordinating these organs. The active relaxation of the bladder, coupled by the ability of the urethra and sphincter to contain urine within the bladder by acting as a closure mechanism during filling, allow storage of urine until an appropriate time and place to void is reached. The role of the pelvic floor in providing support to the bladder and urethra, and allowing normal abdominal pressure transmission to the proximal urethra, is also considered essential in the maintenance of continence. Crucial to the healthy functioning of the bladder, urethra, sphincter and pelvic floor is co-ordination between them, facilitated by an intact nervous system control.</P>
<P>Incontinence occurs when this normal relationship between the lower urinary tract components is disrupted, resulting from nerve damage or direct mechanical trauma to the pelvic organs. Advancing age, higher parity, vaginal delivery, obesity and menopause are associated with an increase in risk (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are different types of urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence is the symptom of involuntary loss of urine during situations of increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or sneezing. The International Continence Society defines 'urodynamic stress incontinence' as the involuntary loss of urine with increased intra-abdominal pressure during filling cystometry, in the absence of detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). Thus, urodynamic evaluation is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence. It is not clear, however, especially from the clinical management standpoint, whether urodynamic diagnosis is imperative for successful treatment of stress incontinence. Therefore, this review included women diagnosed with either stress urinary incontinence (symptom alone) or urodynamic stress incontinence.</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) constitutes a huge financial economic burden to society. In the USA, the annual total direct costs of urinary incontinence in both men and women is over USD 16 billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>), with societal costs of USD 26.2 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1998</LINK>). Approximately, USD 13.12 billion of the total direct costs of urinary incontinence is spent on SUI (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>About 70% of this USD 13.12 billion is borne by the patients, mainly through routine care (purchasing pads and disposable underwear (diapers), laundry and dry cleaning). This constitutes a significant individual financial burden. Of the remaining 30% of costs, 14% is spent on nursing home admission, 9% on treatment, 6% on addressing complications and 1% on diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study in the USA reported that about 1% of the median annual household income (USD 50,000 to USD 59,999 in 2006) was spent by women on incontinence management. This study estimated that women spent an annual mean cost of USD 751 to USD 1277 (2006 USD) on incontinence. This cost increases with the severity of the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Subak-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subak 2008a</LINK>). The indirect cost associated exerts a social and psychological burden which is unquantifiable. (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, <LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2004</LINK> estimated that the annual average direct medical costs of SUI for one year (1998 USD) was USD 5642 and USD 4208 for indirect workplace costs. The cost of management and treatment of SUI appears to have increased over time, due to increasing prevalence and increased desire for improved quality of life (QOL). This in turn has resulted from improved recognition of the condition, as well as increased use of surgical and non-surgical managements.</P>
<P>Two types of stress incontinence are recognised, one from a hypermobile but otherwise healthy urethra and one from deficiency of the sphincter itself (<LINK REF="REF-Blaivas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaivas 1988</LINK>). Urethral hypermobility is a manifestation of weakened support of the proximal urethra while sphincter deficiency is an indication of compromised ability of the urethra to act as a watertight outlet. Both types were considered together for this review for three reasons. Firstly, few studies have distinguished between them; secondly, a standardised test is not available to differentiate between them accurately; and lastly, there is increasing belief that both types are present most of the time although to differing degrees.</P>
<P>Urge incontinence is the symptom of involuntary loss of urine associated with a sudden, strong desire to void (urgency). It is usually a manifestation of uncontrolled bladder wall contraction (detrusor overactivity). Bladder overactivity may be suspected clinically from symptoms of frequency and urgency. When detected urodynamically, bladder overactivity is termed either as 'neurogenic detrusor overactivity' if there is an underlying neurologic pathology associated with it, or 'idiopathic detrusor overactivity' when there is none. Women with urge incontinence alone were not included in this review.</P>
<P>Mixed incontinence is the condition of urine leakage with features of both stress and urgency. Women with mixed incontinence were included in this review. They could either have stress incontinence with symptoms of frequency and urgency, stress and urge incontinence (either diagnosed by symptom alone or by urodynamics), or stress incontinence with detrusor overactivity, or urodynamic stress incontinence with detrusor overactivity.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-02 09:47:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment for urinary incontinence includes 'conservative', pharmacological and surgical interventions. Conservative management includes physical therapies (for example pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, biofeedback and vaginal weighted cones), lifestyle modification (for example weight loss, regulation of fluid intake), behavioural interventions (for example bladder retraining, timed voiding) and mechanical devices (for example urethral plugs and inserts to prevent or reduce urine leakage). Drug therapies include alpha-adrenergic agents and duloxetine (mainly for stress urinary incontinence), anticholinergics and antispasmodics (for urge incontinence) and estrogens. Conservative therapy, with or without the use of medications, is generally undertaken before resorting to surgery. These interventions are the subject of separate Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>Surgical procedures to treat stress urinary incontinence generally aim to improve the support to the urethro-vesical junction and correct deficient urethral closure. There is disagreement, however, regarding the precise mechanism by which continence is achieved with surgical manipulation. The surgeon's preference, co-existing pelvic floor problems, and the anatomical features of the patient and her general health condition often influence the choice of procedure. Numerous surgical methods have been described but essentially they fall into seven categories, with one category subdivided into three.</P>

<P>This review focused on the first of these.

There is also a Cochrane review which looks at treatment of recurrent stress urinary incontinence after failed minimally invasive synthetic suburethral tape surgery in women (<LINK REF="REF-Bakali-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakali 2013</LINK>). There is as yet no Cochrane review of artificial urethral sphincters.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-02 09:47:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retropubic colposuspension is the surgical approach of lifting the tissues near the bladder neck and proximal urethra in the area of the pelvis behind the anterior pubic bones. When it is an 'open' procedure, the approach is through an incision over the lower abdomen. There are generally three variations of open retropubic colposuspension:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Burch;</LI>
<LI>Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK);</LI>
<LI>Paravaginal defect repair or vagina-obturator shelf repair.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The Burch colposuspension is the elevation of the anterior vaginal wall and paravesical tissues towards the ileopectineal line of the pelvic side wall using two to four sutures on either side (<LINK REF="REF-Burch-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burch 1961</LINK>). The Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure is the suspension of the vesico-urethral junction (bladder neck) onto the periosteum of the symphysis pubis (<LINK REF="REF-Mainprize-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainprize 1988</LINK>). The paravaginal defect repair, or the vagina-obturator shelf repair, is a modification of the Burch with placement of the sutures extended laterally and anchored at the obturator shelf rather than the ileopectineal line (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1976</LINK>). It aims to close the fascial defect rather than elevate the tissues at the paravesical area.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:46:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The wide variety of treatment options for stress incontinence indicates the lack of a clear consensus as to which procedure is the most effective. Several organisations have produced guidelines for provision of good healthcare service (<LINK REF="REF-Fantl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fantl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1997</LINK>). However, these reports were based on studies of mixed quality and consequently some recommendations were based on consensus rather than reliable evidence. The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI), now in its fourth iteration, is another similar initiative which uses evidence of mixed quality (<A HREF="http://www.congress-urology.org/">www.congress-urology.org</A>). Systematic and methodical analyses of well-designed randomised controlled trials have also been performed (for example <LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novara 2008</LINK>) but each has its own limitations in terms of database, methodology and, more importantly, updating in the event of new evidence.</P>
<P>While stress urinary incontinence is now generally managed surgically with minimally invasive procedures, particularly with the use of mid-urethral slings, such procedures are not readily available in many countries. This is partly because of the limitations of expertise but also, more importantly, because of the difficulty in acquiring the slings, either because of their unavailability or their prohibitive cost.</P>

These are: selection bias from insecure random allocation of treatments; attrition bias from dropouts or losses to follow-up, particularly if there was a differential dropout rate between groups; and biased ascertainment (detection bias) of outcome where knowledge of the allocation might have influenced the measurement of outcome.

When we identified more than one eligible study, we carried out quantitative synthesis. Where appropriate, we calculated a combined estimate of treatment effect across similar studies for each pre-specified outcome. For categorical (dichotomous) outcomes we related the numbers reporting an outcome to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR). For continuous variables, we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference (MD), and generated 95% confidence intervals (CI), where possible.</P>
<P>Where statistical synthesis of data from more than one study was not possible or not considered appropriate, we undertook a narrative review of eligible studies. We sought data on the number of women with each outcome event by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up, to allow an intention-to-treat analysis when possible. For trials with missing data, we based the primary analysis upon the observed data, as reported, without imputation for missing data. We carried out sensitivity analyses using different assumptions about missing data.</P>

In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McCrery-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McCrery 2005</LINK>) there were more women lost to follow up in the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure group compared to the Burch colposuspension group.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>) reported its five year follow up data as a long-term observational study wherein not all women initially enrolled in the trial were included.

<P>A form of intention-to-treat analysis was done in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>) wherein different assumptions and scenarios were described and corresponding results calculated. We opted to report the actual data, making no assumptions about these women. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>) stated that analysis of data was done on an intention-to-treat basis although the particulars were not provided. One trial deliberately did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK>). The rest of the trials did not explicitly state if intention-to-treat analysis was performed or if an attempt was made to do so. Details on how women crossing over between treatment groups were handled, and if outcomes among the withdrawals and dropouts were sought, were either not provided or were insufficient to allow the review authors to execute an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK> did not attain the projected sample size judged necessary to detect a pre-determined difference in the primary outcome. The sample size of <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK> was based on detecting a difference in the obstructive effect of the two interventions studied rather than cure rates. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liapis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 2002</LINK>) attempted to perform a back calculation of the study sample's power, suggesting a marginally underpowered trial.</P>
<P>In general, the trial sample sizes were small, with each arm usually having a population of less than 40. The largest trial was a two-armed trial on open colposuspension versus a sling procedure, enrolling more than 200 women per treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>). Five larger studies (sample size more than 100) were three-armed trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>). However, we had to convert three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>) into two-armed trials since the review authors assessed two of the three interventions to be of the same category. In <LINK REF="STD-Gilja-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gilja 1998</LINK> the data of the Raz procedure and the trans-vaginal Burch and Gilja groups were combined, since the latter was assessed to be a needle procedure as well. The Burch and Marshall-Marchetti groups in <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK> were combined as the open colposuspension group in comparison with the anterior colporrhaphy group. In Arkandal 2001, the two laparoscopic colposuspension arms were combined as one comparator group against open colposuspension.</P>

The methodological quality of both studies was poor.

<P>The studies showed consistency of results favouring surgery for open colposuspension versus PFMT in the short term:</P>
<OL>
<LI>in subjective incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Klarskov-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klarskov 1986</LINK>), 3/16 versus 10/13 (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.71, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>); and</LI>

</OL>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Klarskov-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klarskov 1986</LINK>, incontinence did improve in the majority of women, but the numbers were too small to test the difference between surgery and conservative treatment (number of women failing to improve 2/16 versus 2/13 (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.13 to 5.01, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>)). Long-term results (up to eight years) were available for <LINK REF="STD-Klarskov-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klarskov 1986</LINK> but the data could not be used as the results in the surgery group were not reported separately according to type of surgical procedure (Burch or anterior repair or both procedures).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: open retropubic colposuspension versus drug therapy</HEADING>
<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2003</LINK>) compared open retropubic colposuspension with anticholinergic treatment in a subset of 44 women, of whom 21 received oxybutynin 5 mg twice daily with titration and 23 underwent Burch colposuspension (the remaining 24 women of the total study population underwent a pubovaginal sling procedure). The methodological quality of the trial was poor. A mixed surgical approach was taken and although the two groups were originally randomised, participants were then selected for colposuspension or sling procedure on the basis of the Valsalva leak point pressure. The estimation of effect size for this study may have been biased in favour of the drug therapy because those who failed to complete the anticholinergic treatment were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>The only useable outcome measures for this review were the subjective cure rates and a quantitative symptom scoring system as means of assessing improvement. One hundred per cent failed subjectively after drug therapy compared with three out of 23 after colposuspension (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The subjective symptom scores showed improvement in both treatment groups, with the colposuspension group having a greater degree of improvement compared to the drug therapy group (P &lt; 0.05). Post-treatment subjective and objective symptom scores after open retropubic colposuspension showed significantly lower (better) scores compared with oxybutynin treatment. Women undergoing colposuspension scored a mean 3.3 points lower (95% CI -3.96 to -2.64) and a mean 3.8 points lower (95% CI -4.59 to -3.01, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) on subjective and objective scoring, respectively, than those scores of women receiving oxybutynin.</P>

<P>A total of nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Din-Shawki-2012" TYPE="STUDY">El-Din Shawki 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerer_x002d_Doak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerer-Doak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1985</LINK>) compared open retropubic colposuspension with anterior colporrhaphy. These trials involved 627 women with 353 randomised to undergo retropubic colposuspension (note: these totals do not include the women from <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Din-Shawki-2012" TYPE="STUDY">El-Din Shawki 2012</LINK> because the distribution of the study population into the treatment groups was not reported). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>) had moderate rather than small sample sizes (200 and 155 participants, respectively) although both were three-armed trials.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was generally satisfactory. However, there was a lack of detail on blinding and concealment of allocation. Most trials had co-interventions (mostly addressing prolapse when present) and there was some variation in the study populations across the trials in terms of inclusion of recurrent cases and presence of significant prolapse at study entry. Two out of the nine trials included recurrent incontinence cases (<LINK REF="STD-Kammerer_x002d_Doak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerer-Doak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1985</LINK>). Six trials included women with prolapse (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerer_x002d_Doak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerer-Doak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1985</LINK>). Estimates of effect derived from these six were similar to those derived from the two trials that excluded women with prolapse.</P>
<P>For this section, the results for Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK) were considered with those for Burch colposuspension. <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK> described the technique used for open colposuspension, termed in the report as "retropubic urethropexy" as that of the MMK while <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK> had three treatment arms, wherein one arm underwent the Burch procedure, another had the MMK procedure, and anterior repair was performed on the third group. When the results of the Burch and the MMK groups were considered together in <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>, the estimates of effects were consistent with those from the other trials which performed only the Burch procedure, and no statistical heterogeneity was noted during the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>However, there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results of the studies for the three different outcomes examined, that is, long-term objective cure rate, length of hospital stay and occurrence of new prolapse, which appeared to reflect <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK>. We performed sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK> from the meta-analysis, and another excluding the MMK arm in <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>, to explore any difference in the results for outcomes which included data from these trials. We also carried out a subgroup analysis reporting the results from these two different operations separately (Burch versus anterior repair and MMK versus anterior repair)(<LINK REF="CMP-004.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.19</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.20</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Women's observations (outcomes 4.1 to 4.3)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from seven trials evaluating a total of 695 women (with assessments available at different time periods) showed a lower incontinence rate for subjective cure after open retropubic colposuspension than after anterior colporrhaphy. Such benefit was maintained over time:</P>
<OL>
<LI>incontinence rates 9% versus 19% (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72) before the first year (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>);</LI>

</OL>
<P>A sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK> (because the operation tested was MMK rather than Burch) removed the heterogeneity and strengthened the long-term result in favour of the Burch procedure (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quantification of symptoms (outcome 4.12)</HEADING>
<P>Data from one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK>) showed no difference in the two-hour pad test results but with a wide confidence interval (MD 1.1 gm; 95% CI -4.41 to 6.61, <LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinician's observations (outcomes 4.9 to 4.11)</HEADING>
<P>Consistent with the results for subjective cure, there was also evidence that open retropubic colposuspension was more effective than anterior colporrhaphy for objective cure rates. The benefit was maintained over time:</P>
<OL>
<LI>incontinence rates 9% versus 25% (RR 0.36; 95% CI 95% 0.22 to 0.58) within one year (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>16% versus 44% (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.47) at one year but before five years (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>26% versus 54% (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73) after five years (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>As would be expected, sensitivity analyses excluding <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK> removed the heterogeneity. There was some indirect evidence that the Burch procedure was more effective than the MMK procedure (<LINK REF="CMP-004.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.19</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, the risk of failing to cure urinary incontinence through open retropubic colposuspension was only half that of anterior repair, with an estimated absolute risk difference (ARR) of around 20% (ARR 0.21; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.27). To put this another way, for every five women treated, one extra was cured after open retropubic colposuspension.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life measures (outcome 4.14)</HEADING>
<P>There was only one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kammerer_x002d_Doak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerer-Doak 1999</LINK>) that investigated the impact of both types of surgery on the quality of life through an incontinence rating score. Scores improved in both treatment groups. There was a small (less than 1 point) but statistically significantly better improvement in the quality of life scores in the open retropubic colposuspension group compared to the anterior colporrhaphy group (MD -0.59; 95% CI -1.11 to -0.07, <LINK REF="CMP-004.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.8</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical outcome measures (outcomes 4.16 to 4.19)</HEADING>
<P>Data from one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>) showed a longer operating time for colposuspension (MD 14.40 minutes, 95% CI 5.43 to 23.37, <LINK REF="CMP-004.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pattern of results for length of hospital stay differed between the two trials with data. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK>), women had an average three fewer days in hospital after open retropubic colposuspension compared with anterior repair, whereas the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>) showed no difference. Because of the heterogeneity no attempt was made to derive an estimate from combined data (<LINK REF="CMP-004.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>The estimates for the time to catheter removal post-operatively, available from three trials (outcome 4.19) (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>) were not statistically significantly different (MD -0.28 days, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.27, <LINK REF="CMP-004.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.11</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events (outcomes 4.20 to 4.26)</HEADING>
<P>The included trials reported adverse events in different ways, with only one or two providing data for a particular event. Thus, there were limited data to draw conclusions confidently for each adverse event. Based on two trials with data, the number of perioperative complications was significantly lower with open retropubic colposuspension (outcome 4.20: RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.83, <LINK REF="CMP-004.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.12</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK> reported more wound infections in the retropubic colposuspension group, but more haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>) and more positive urine cultures (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 1996</LINK>) in the anterior repair group. <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989a</LINK> reported no difference in post-operative complications between the treatment groups, although specific data were not provided.</P>
<P>Estimates of the risk for de novo urge symptoms and urge incontinence, and risk for detrusor were inconclusive as the data were not statistically significant and had wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerer_x002d_Doak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerer-Doak 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>). In three trials with data, there were fewer women with de novo urge symptoms or incontinence after open retropubic colposuspension but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14, <LINK REF="CMP-004.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.13</LINK>). In four small trials with data there was no statistically significant difference in the risk for developing urodynamically demonstrable de novo detrusor overactivity post-operatively (event rates: 8% versus 6% (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.94, <LINK REF="CMP-004.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.14</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Four trials evaluated the risk for voiding difficulty after open retropubic colposuspension and anterior repair. Across the four trials there were only three events of voiding difficulty, all occurring in the open colposuspension group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.15</LINK>). For this reason no combined estimate was derived.</P>
<P>Data on the risk of recurrent or new prolapse were available from five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1985</LINK>). It is of note that all trials had an adequate mean follow up of at least one year at the time of assessment of the prolapse. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the results between the trials and the groups were statistically different in only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1985</LINK>). Although there were more women with prolapse in the open colposuspension groups (16% versus 5%), this did not reach statistical significance when a random-effects model was used (RR 2.51; 95% CI 0.62 to 10.10, <LINK REF="CMP-004.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.16</LINK>). Examination of study design and population characteristics across the trials did not reveal any possible source of difference that could explain the heterogeneity. The largest difference in post-operative prolapse rates was demonstrated in <LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2000</LINK>, which had a very long follow-up of at least eight years and showed a risk difference of over 50% in favour of anterior repair.</P>
<P>Consistent with the findings on cure, fewer women in the colposuspension group had repeat anti-incontinence surgery (6.3% versus 23.4% (RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30, <LINK REF="CMP-004.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.17</LINK>); estimated absolute difference 21% from the three trials with data).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data issues</HEADING>
<P>We distributed data on the subjective cure rates of the Burch colposuspension group from <LINK REF="STD-Bai-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2005</LINK> between the subcategories of open colposuspension versus traditional sling procedures and open colposuspension versus self-fixing sling procedures to avoid double counting for the meta-analysis. For <LINK REF="STD-Elshawaf-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Elshawaf 2009</LINK>, we planned to combine the data for the TOT and TVT groups. However, we could not extract any usable data from the report as the results were limited to a narrative description.</P>
<P>We could not enter data from <LINK REF="STD-Halaska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Halaska 2001</LINK> into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) as the results of a visual analogue scale were presented in a graph and it was not clear how the figures were derived. A conference abstract on a subset of women from that trial reported that the results in two- and six-month follow-up revealed no difference in the clinical outcomes between TVT and Burch. It was also reported that TVT was superior to the Burch procedure in terms of restoring normal sexual activity. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Henriksson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksson 1978</LINK>) reported equivalent results in both treatment groups but no data were provided. Outcomes studied in <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2000</LINK>, which were based on tissue collagen analysis results, were not used in this review. We used data from the longest follow-up from trials which reported the event rates at different time periods In the analysis of the risk for prolapse.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007 </LINK>used various criteria to define success. We selected symptoms as the criterion to define subjective cure (using self-reported incontinence using a questionnaire) and the pad test results to define objective cure because the other trials in this comparison used these parameters to define subjective and objective cure.</P>
<P>Only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>) had long-term results (at and after five years). However, the extension study of <LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK> only included a proportion of the initially enrolled study population (482/665) and incontinent women were more likely to enrol in the follow up study (P &lt;0.0001). The numbers used in the analysis for the number of incontinent women, based on self-reported incontinence questionnaires, were difficult to determine, as the paper stated the number of women who completed the study at five years but data for more women were available for different outcomes. Hence, the denominators for the continence rates used in this review were only derived values based on reported percentages and counts in the paper. The inclusion of this long-term outcomes data, being part of an observational study, rather than part of the randomized trial, was subjected to sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>While <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Din-Shawki-2012" TYPE="STUDY">El-Din Shawki 2012</LINK> reported outcomes, we were not able to include the data in the review because it did not specify how the participants were allocated across the three treatment groups.</P>

<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-El-Barky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">El Barky 2005</LINK>) was too small to provide evidence of any difference in subjective improvement rates within one year between open colposuspension and sling procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Medium-term cure</HEADING>
<P>Data for incontinence rates at one- to five-year follow-up were available from six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Enzelsberger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Enzelsberger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivaslioglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sivaslioglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tellez-Martinez_x002d_Fornes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tellez Martinez-Fornes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>).

Data from studies using traditional slings alone showed lower incontinence rates with traditional slings (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical outcomes (outcomes 5.16 to 5.19)</HEADING>

<P>The four trials (; <LINK REF="STD-Sivaslioglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sivaslioglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tellez-Martinez_x002d_Fornes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tellez Martinez-Fornes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>) that compared the operative times between colposuspension and sling procedure showed conflicting results (<LINK REF="CMP-005.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.10</LINK>). This discrepancy is likely to be due to the different types of sling operations performed. <LINK REF="STD-Demirci-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Demirci 2001</LINK>, which used a free rectus fascial sling through a combined abdominoperineal approach, showed a longer operative time while the self-fixing sling trials using TVT had a significantly shorter operative time when compared to open colposuspension.</P>
<P>Hospital stay was reported by eight trials. Two trials showed similar lengths of stay for both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Demirci-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Demirci 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Enzelsberger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Enzelsberger 1996</LINK>) reported that women stayed in hospital eight fewer days in the colposuspension group compared to the traditional sling group. The six trials that compared open colposuspension with TVT (<LINK REF="STD-Bandarian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bandarian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El-Barky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">El Barky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koelbl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koelbl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivaslioglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sivaslioglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>) consistently showed shorter hospital stays with the self-fixing (TVT) group.

While the different types of sling procedures used and the different method of diagnosis of incontinence may explain the disparity in the results between <LINK REF="STD-Koelbl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koelbl 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Enzelsberger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Enzelsberger 1996</LINK>, they do not explain the difference between the results of <LINK REF="STD-Koelbl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koelbl 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK>. Different policies in the removal of catheters post-operation that was adopted in the different trials could explain the diversity of results.

<P>Based on evidence from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Demirci-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Demirci 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Enzelsberger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Enzelsberger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>) women undergoing open retropubic colposuspension were nearly twice at risk of developing new or recurrent prolapse compared to those undergoing sling procedures (33.9% versus 20.1% (RR 1.85; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.75, <LINK REF="CMP-005.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.17</LINK>)). <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK> trial reported a significant reduction in objective cystocoele but more enterocoele and vault or cervical prolapse cases in the colposuspension group compared with the TVT group, both at six months, two years and five years after surgery. However, if only symptomatic prolapse was considered, there were no significant differences between the two groups. This trial also reported on the need for repeat continence surgery, but the numbers were too few for reliable analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-005.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.18</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nine trials reported data on bladder perforation (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bandarian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bandarian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El-Barky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">El Barky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koelbl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koelbl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivaslioglu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sivaslioglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tellez-Martinez_x002d_Fornes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tellez Martinez-Fornes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>). Results from the lone trial using the traditional sling differed from those trials using the TVT (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>). Data from this trial showed that there was a five-fold higher risk of having sutures pass through the bladder during open colposuspension compared to during the pubovaginal sling procedure (perforation rates: 3% versus 0.06% (RR 4.95; 95% CI 1.09 to 22.44, <LINK REF="CMP-005.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.20</LINK>.)). In contrast, data from the TVT trials consistently showed a trend towards lesser risk for bladder perforation during open colposuspension (perforation rate: 0.9% versus 6.3% (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49, <LINK REF="CMP-005.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.20</LINK>)).</P>
<P>There was also a significant vascular injury during TVT. None of these complications had serious consequences. <LINK REF="STD-Sand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sand 2000</LINK> reported that one woman required urethrolysis for persistent urinary retention and two women suffered from partial erosions after the TVT procedure in the long-term follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK> reported that the long term outcome involving the TVT procedure showed tape complications in a total of six women out of 170 at five-year follow-up.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2001</LINK> had three citations, two of which referred to a multi-centre trial on open versus laparoscopic colposuspension using mesh and staples, while the third was on a single institution, three-armed trial on open versus laparoscopic colposuspension using mesh and staples versus laparoscopic colposuspension using sutures.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Women's observations</HEADING>
<P>Although data on patient-reported incontinence rates were available from all 12 trials, they related to differing lengths of follow-up. Furthermore, there appeared to be some heterogeneity between studies and the estimates from the meta-analyses depended on which trials were used to contribute data.</P>
<P>In the short-term, the combined estimate showed a wide confidence interval, consistent with as much as 20% favouring of either intervention (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). In the medium-term (between one and five years), the combined estimate favoured open surgery (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>) but this was not statistically significant and there was significant heterogeneity. This was due to <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2001</LINK> which used both sutures and mesh and staples (and where mesh and staples were used in the majority of patients) during the laparoscopic colposuspension (rather than sutures as in the other trials) and its removal eliminated the heterogeneity. Without the Ankardal data (which reported highly significantly better results with open colposuspension and was given a considerable weight in the meta-analysis), no difference in the cure rates between the open and laparoscopic colposuspension could be demonstrated (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11). In the long term, the single small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>) with 64 participants tended to favour laparoscopic repair (RR 1.89; 95% CI 0.99 to 3.59, <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>), however the result did not quite reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mak-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mak 2000</LINK>) reported on improvement rates: three women in total failed to improve (out of 90) in the medium term (<LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>); the confidence interval was very wide.</P>

<P>To a large extent, the same issues applied to objective measures of incontinence. The meta-analyses of data (six trials) available at less than one year (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21, <LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>) and between one and five years (seven trials) (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.19, <LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>) did not show any significant differences in objective incontinence rates between the two treatment groups. Again, there was heterogeneity in the medium-term results because of <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2001</LINK>. However, inclusion or exclusion of the data did not change the results of the meta-analysis. The single small trial of <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK> showed a statistically significant result favouring laparoscopic repair (<LINK REF="CMP-007.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.7</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:40:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous surgical methods have been described for managing urinary incontinence, yet the quest for the ideal procedure with the highest effectiveness, least morbidity, and highest cost effectiveness is still ongoing. Large numbers of studies have been conducted and the need to integrate the results from high quality research into a meaningful and clinically useful recommendation has become imperative. This systematic review aimed to address this in respect to open retropubic colposuspension.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:40:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, open retropubic colposuspension has been shown to provide significantly better cure rates, both subjectively and objectively, compared to most of the other management options. Of all the other methods studied, the sling procedures and the laparoscopic technique of performing colposuspension seem to most closely approximate the efficacy of open colposuspension.</P>
<P>Open retropubic colposuspension was regarded as the gold standard treatment for urinary incontinence in women before the advent of new, minimally invasive procedures such as TVT. However, in countries where minimally invasive suburethral tapes are not available or the cost is prohibitive, open colposuspension remains the treatment of choice with its high success rates and acceptable levels of associated morbidity. The results of this systematic review present the evidence supporting such a view. The results of the trials considered in this review have shown overall cure rates of 69% to 88% for open retropubic colposuspension. These figures are consistent with those reported in other reviews, such as those conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1994</LINK>. Women must be given a balanced view, however, of the likely benefits and possible risks to help them make informed decisions.</P>
<P>Two small trials showed a significant advantage of open retropubic colposuspension over conservative management, with effect differences of 60% to 70%. While it is instinctive among women to favour conservative treatment over surgery, the prospect of achieving dryness offered by open retropubic colposuspension compared to conservative measures may be enough to make a woman seriously consider undergoing the procedure, despite the risks of surgery, especially in cases of severe, incapacitating incontinence.</P>
<P>More important perhaps than its short- to medium-term performance is the durability of effectiveness several years after an open retropubic colposuspension operation. This is its main strength and has been the primary basis for considering it as the gold standard in the surgical treatment of urinary incontinence in women. Based on the results of this review, one can expect a decline in the cure rate of only 15% to 20% even beyond five years after open colposuspension. In contrast, anterior colporrhaphy and needle suspension procedures showed a decline of at least 40% and 30%, respectively, over a similar period of time.</P>
<P>The two interventions that compare most favourably with open colposuspension are the sling procedure and the laparoscopic technique of colposuspension. Long-term trial results, although small in number, seem to show a similar enduring effect on continence rates from these procedures, comparable with open colposuspension.</P>
<P>To supplement the main systematic review of effects, we sought economic evaluations which have compared open retropubic colposuspension with any of the other main categories of surgical procedures listed in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section. A supplementary search in NHS EED, MEDLINE and Embase identified four such economic evaluations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Colposuspension versus slings</HEADING>
<P>The comparison of open colposuspension with TVT is largely dependent on a single medium-sized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2002</LINK>). To an extent, the interpretation of this depends on what assumptions are made about the women who refused their allocated procedure, most of whom were allocated to the colposuspension group. It is plausible that they were women with milder incontinence at trial entry; assuming that they would all have been cured by colposuspension, this tilts the comparison in favour of colposuspension. Nevertheless, this trial does illustrate the substantial short-term advantages of TVT in terms of less post-operative morbidity and more rapid return to normal activities. The main perioperative complication of TVT is bladder perforation, although this does not appear to have longer-term implications.</P>
<P>With the inclusion of more data on traditional slings and TVT, a further examination of the effects of these two types of procedures and their comparison against open colposuspension was possible in this update. The inclusion of extra long-term data from a large trial of traditional slings (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>) demonstrated that the traditional slings had better long-term cure rates but a higher chance of post-operative voiding dysfunction rates compared to open colposuspension. On the other hand, the TVT trials have only shown non-inferiority in terms of cure rates when compared with open colposuspension. This possible difference in the effects of the traditional sling and the TVT should be explored and studied, and are the subjects of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehman 2011</LINK>). </P>
<P>Clinicians must therefore inform women of the differences in adverse event profiles for each technique. Open colposuspension has been shown to be associated with pelvic organ prolapse, particularly in the long term. On the other hand, sling operations put women at a higher risk for postoperative voiding dysfunction.</P>

<P>Four studies compared the use of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) with Burch colposuspension in the treatment of SUI in women (<LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>) using clinical data from our MEDLINE search of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>) or both RCTs and observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>) and from a prospective multicentre randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>) adopted the perspective of the US healthcare system with a time horizon of 10 years, while <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK> adopted the UK payer&#8217;s perspective (UK National Health Service) with up to 10 years and less than a year time horizon, respectively. The Burch colposuspension procedure was reported to be more expensive than TVT in all studies. <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK> reported an average cost in 2005 US Dollars of USD 9320 for Burch colposuspension and USD 8082 for TVT (P values and Cl not reported). <LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK> reported an average cost of USD 10,545 for Burch colposuspension and USD 8651 for TVT (price year and Cl not reported) While <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK> reported the cost (2001 GBP) of GBP 1345 and GBP 1588 (after 1 year from initial surgery) and GBP 1645 and GBP 1920 (after 10 years from initial surgery) for TVT and open colposuspension, respectively. <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK> reported the cost (1999 - 2000 GBP) of GBP 1058 for TVT and GBP 1301 for open colposuspension (Differential costs: -243 (-341 to -201)). </P>
<P>Burch colposuspension was on average slightly more effective, generating 0.01 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 10 years compared to TVT (7.26 QALYs versus 7.25 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 98,755 per QALY gained (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK>, however, reported that TVT generated on average 0.01 more QALYs at 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>) and six months (<LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK>) than the Burch procedure. The number of QALYs for each procedure and each study were; 5.79 QALYs for TVT versus 5.78 QALYs for Burch, 7.69 QALYs for TVT versus 7.68 QALYs for Burch and 0.397 QALYs for TVT versus 0.387 QALYs for Burch reported in <LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK>, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK> concluded that TVT was more cost-effective compared to Burch colposuspension based on the higher costs and minimal additional QALYs gained from the Burch colposuspension (probability not reported). <LINK REF="REF-Laudano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudano 2013</LINK> also concluded that TVT was cost-effective, with 90% probability that it was more cost-effective than Burch colposuspension in the treatment of SUI in women. Burch colposuspension was estimated to only be more cost-effective than TVT if the failure rate of TVT increases over time or when the cure rate was less than 42%. <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK> concluded that there was an 86% probability that TVT was cost-effective compared to open colposuspension with a willingness-to-pay of GBP 30,000. TVT was found to be slightly less effective than open colposuspension in terms of QALYs for the first four years; beyond five years TVT became effective. <LINK REF="REF-Manca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manca 2003</LINK> concluded that for a 12-month follow-up the probability that TVT was more cost-effective than colposuspension was 94.6% when the decision-maker is willing to pay at least GBP 30,000 per additional QALY.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open abdominal colposuspension versus laparoscopic colposuspension</HEADING>
<P>Shorter hospital stay was seen in trials that compared laparoscopic colposuspension with the open technique. However, failure to ensure blinding of the participants' care providers in the included trials may have introduced some bias towards earlier discharge from hospital for those undergoing laparoscopy. As noted in the results, for trials wherein blinding was employed, no significant difference in the length of hospitalisation was noted between women undergoing open and laparoscopic colposuspension. Also, hospital stay, particularly in elective surgical cases, is usually subject to institutional policies more than a reflection of actual patient needs. It is unclear from the reports if policies have been properly controlled or standardised in the conduct of the trials. There was not enough evidence in this review to judge whether laparoscopic colposuspension has an advantage or disadvantage compared to the open procedure in terms of subjective and objective cure rates, safety, longer-term complications and quality of life.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Economic evidence</HEADING>
<P>A cost-effectiveness analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2006</LINK> alongside a randomised controlled trial comparing open colposuspension with laparoscopic colposuspension in patients with SUI in the UK. The cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS. Healthcare resource use (2002 - 2003 GBP) relating to the surgery, associated hospital stay and first six months after hospital discharge were collected prospectively for each participant. The data required for the calculation of QALYs were collected prospectively using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.</P>
<P>The economic evaluation was for both a six-month and up to 24-month time horizons. Healthcare resource use over six-month follow-up resulted in costs of GBP 1805 for the laparoscopic arm and GBP 1433 for the open arm (differential mean cost GBP 372; 95% credibility interval [CrI]: 274 to 471). At six months, QALYs were slightly higher on average in the laparoscopic arm relative to the open arm (0.005, 95% CrI &#8211;0.012 to 0.023). On average the incremental cost per extra QALY provided by the laparoscopic approach was GBP 74,400 at six months. At 24 months, the laparoscopic arm again had a higher mean QALYs compared to the open surgery group (0.04, 95% CrI -0.009 to 0.086). If the laparoscopic colposuspension did not incur any significant additional costs after six months compared with open colposuspension, then the incremental cost per extra QALY reduced to GBP 9300 at 24 months. The probability that laparoscopic colposuspension is cost-effective was 86% when the decision-maker is willing to pay up to GBP 30,000 for an additional QALY. <LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2006</LINK> concluded that laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost-effective when compared with open colposuspension during the first six months, but the additional QALYs might be judged to be worth the additional cost after 24 months follow-up.</P>

<P>Despite the relatively small combined sample size of the trials comparing the Burch colposuspension and the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure, the pooled data provide enough evidence that the Burch technique results in higher cure rates. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the data limiting the trials to those which employed the Burch procedure in comparison with the other techniques showed greater benefits for open retropubic colposuspension Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the Burch technique should be regarded as the standard open retropubic colposuspension procedure.</P>

<P>Options for adrenergic drug treatment of stress urinary incontinence are limited (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane review of the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor duloxetine was published in 2005; it does not include trials comparing duloxetine with surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mariappan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariappan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>With respect to alternative approaches to surgery, some of the findings in this review may not be relevant to current practice. This is especially true with regard to the infrequent to almost non-existent use of anterior colporrhaphy and needle suspension procedures in the treatment of urinary incontinence, particularly in Western countries. However, it is believed that in certain Asian countries, anterior colporrhaphy is still widely offered as a first-line treatment for urinary incontinence. One of the main arguments for this practice is the perceived lower morbidity rates associated with vaginal surgery compared to the retropubic or abdominal approach. This review has not shown any significantly higher risk for perioperative complications and adverse effects for open colposuspension compared with the other surgical techniques. However, the combined trial populations included in this review may be too small in number, and thus lack the power, to detect such a difference. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that this review indicates higher post-operative morbidity rates associated with needle suspension procedures and anterior colporrhaphy when directly compared with open colposuspension. Such a finding seems to be in conflict with prevailing views and recommendations, which are mostly based on observational studies.</P>
<P>The evaluation provided by this review was limited by the fact that very few studies focused on the impact of the various treatment modalities on quality of life after treatment, long term outcomes on cosmesis, voiding dysfunction, sexual function and repeat incontinence surgery of alternative procedures. These parameters could be key determinants for decision making.</P>
<P>Estimates of outcomes in surgical trials may not reflect real life settings. The effect of the surgeon's skills on the outcome, when several surgeons are involved in the trial are not taken into account. Also, expertise of surgeons in trials may not necessarily be comparable to those in pure clinical practice.</P>
<P>We did intend to assess the impact of certain participant characteristics on the estimates of treatment effects. Among the factors were method of diagnosis of incontinence (symptom-based versus urodynamics), previous anti-incontinence surgery, presence of pre-operative prolapse, and presence of signs and symptoms of detrusor overactivity or mixed incontinence. As only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Albo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Albo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Enzelsberger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Enzelsberger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>) relied on symptoms as their main diagnostic criteria for inclusion, the influence of having a urodynamic diagnosis on the outcomes could not be ascertained in this review. It could not be determined whether urodynamics was used to confirm the diagnosis in a further four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Drahoradova-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Drahoradova 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palma-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quadri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Quadri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 2000</LINK>). Most studies did not describe their participants in sufficient detail, according to our pre-specified factors, and hence it was not possible to assess the influence of these factors on the outcomes.</P>
<P>Also, we did not subject these four identified economic evaluations to critical appraisal and we do not attempt to draw any firm or general conclusions about the relative costs or efficiency of open retropubic colposuspension in treatment of SUI<I>.</I> However, the economic evidence available indicates that open retropubic colposuspension is not cost-effective when compared with TVT, but is likely be cost-effective in the short term (i.e. first six months following surgery) when compared with laparoscopic colposuspension in the treatment of SUI.</P>

<P>1. The evidence available indicates that open retropubic colposuspension is an effective treatment for stress urinary incontinence, especially in the long term. Within the first year of treatment, the overall continence rate is approximately 85% to 90%. After five years, approximately 80% of women can expect to be dry. The review showed better cure and improvement rates after open retropubic colposuspension compared to conservative management, anterior colporrhaphy, and needle suspension surgery without any significant increase in morbidity. Therefore, retropubic colposuspension could be offered to women seeking open surgical treatment for urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>2. The minimally invasive sling procedures confer similar success rates in comparison to open colposuspension. However, traditional slings provide better cure rates at the expense of more voiding dysfunction in the short term. The long-term adverse event profile of the sling procedures, in particular with the use of the TVT, is still unclear.</P>
<P>3. Laparoscopic colposuspension should allow speedier recovery, and available evidence shows comparable effectiveness with open surgery.</P>
<P>4. In general, the evidence available does not show a higher morbidity or complication rate with open retropubic colposuspension compared to the other surgical techniques, as has often been claimed. However, we found greater risk for post-operative pelvic organ prolapse after open colposuspension, when compared with anterior colporrhaphy and sling procedures.</P>
<P>5. The available evidence suggests that the Burch procedure should be the preferred technique for open colposuspension. The Burch colposuspension provides better cure rates compared to the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure. There was no evidence on paravaginal repair.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-24 13:17:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. The methodology of the trials in the review could have been more scientifically valid. Future trials of incontinence surgery should have a well-described sequence generation and secure concealment of allocation, standardised procedures with minimal co-interventions and confounders, larger sample sizes to provide sufficiently precise estimates of effects, proper blinding, and longer follow-up of all women randomised irrespective of the treatment actually received, intention-to-treat analyses, and detailed accounts of dropouts and withdrawals with explicit description of handling attrition.</P>
<P>It was not clear whether the methodological limitations in the trials reviewed were actual study design errors or poor reporting. It is highly recommended that clinical trials should be reported following the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. There is an urgent need for further trials of adequate power to assess the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of open retropubic colposuspension in comparison with (a) suburethral slings, using both traditional and minimally invasive approaches, and (b) the laparoscopic technique. In addition, the long-term outcomes of existing trials could and should be reported: this would be a cost-effective way of providing the information that is most important to women, i.e. for how long the operations remain effective, and at what cost in terms of adverse effects or the need for further treatment for urinary incontinence, prolapse or adverse effects.</P>
<P>Future trials should be designed in ways that allow exploration of effects in specific subgroups of women characterised by prognostic factors, and potential confounding by these factors. These include previous anti-incontinence surgery, co-existing prolapse, mixed incontinence, and low maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) or leak point pressures, or suspicion of having a significant component of intrinsic sphincter deficiency.</P>
<P>3. Future research on surgical treatment of urinary incontinence must provide more information on long-term outcomes, particularly on adverse events and quality of life.</P>

<P>Marie Carmela Lapitan wrote the protocol and the text of the main review. She performed the initial screening of studies for inclusion into the review, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction, and analysis of results. She was also responsible for the clinical input for the review.</P>
<P>June Cody performed the second and confirmatory screening of studies for inclusion, assessment of methodological quality, and data extraction. Adrian Grant and June Cody assisted in the analysis and interpretation of the results. Adrian Grant made a significant input to the writing of the review.</P>
<P>For the July 2017 addition of the BECs to this review: Atefeh Mashayekhi was responsible for the entire BECs-related work on this review, i.e. she ran the search for studies, screened the search results, extracted data from relevant studies, revised any existing economics-related text, added the BECs-related text, and responded to any peer referee comments. All authors had the opportunity to comment on the revised review.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:41:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The comparison between open colposuspension and sling procedures was subdivided into three subcategories: (1) open colposuspension versus traditional slings, (2) open colposuspension versus self-fixing slings, and (3) open colposuspension versus single-incision slings because of the increase in the number of trials using minimally invasive sling procedures with its variations. This is also in keeping with the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group's move to have separate reviews for these different types of sling procedures.</P>
<P>July 2017 update: We have added Brief Economic Commentaries (BECs) to all of our 'Surgery for UI in women' Cochrane Reviews. The economic elements throughout the review have been revised; if incorrect, we have stripped them out. We have added new economics-related text. This involved revisions to the Background section, Methods section, e.g. search section referring to added Appendix, Discussion section, Abstract and Plain Language Summary. We have added an appendix with details of the economics searches. The Conclusions section of the review has not changed. The rest of the review has not changed. </P>
