<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Alcohol ignition interlocks may stop repeat drink driving offences, but only as long as they are still fitted</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Convicted drink drivers are sometimes offered the choice of a standard punishment, or for an alcohol ignition interlock to be fitted to their car for a fixed period. To operate a vehicle equipped with an interlock, the driver must first give a breath specimen. If the breath alcohol concentration of the specimen is too high, the vehicle will not start. A number of studies have been conducted to see whether the interlock stops drink drivers from offending again. Most of these studies have not been of high quality. The interlock seems to reduce re-offending as long as it is still fitted to the vehicle, but there is no long-term benefit after it has been removed. However, more studies of good quality are needed to confirm these findings. The low percentage of offenders who choose to have an interlock fitted also makes it difficult to reach firm conclusions about their effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>An ignition interlock device is part of a multi-dimensional programme aimed at reducing recidivism in convicted drink drivers. To operate a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device, the driver must first provide a breath specimen. If the breath alcohol concentration of the specimen exceeds the predetermined level, the vehicle will not start. As a measure to reduce circumvention of the device (i.e. someone else blows into the mouthpiece), random retests are required while the vehicle is running. Other components of the drink driving programme include information seminars for the driver and downloading data from the device's data logger, which logs all test attempts and records all passes, warnings and failures.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To systematically assess the effectiveness of ignition interlock programmes on recidivism rates of drink drivers, by examining rates of recidivism while the ignition interlock device was installed in the vehicle and after removal of the device.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-09 15:51:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised register (Sept 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2002), PubMed (to Aug 2002), EMBASE (1980 to Sept 2002), TRANSPORT (1988 to 2002 issue 06), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2002, Issue 3), The Science Citation Index (1980 to Sept 2002)<BR/>National Research Register (2002, issue 3). We also searched the Internet using various search engines.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Controlled trials in which offenders have been charged with drink driving and have either been sentenced to participate in an ignition interlock programme or the usual punishment (either licence suspension or some form of treatment programme). This study was not restricted by language or status of publication.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One randomised controlled trial (RCT) and ten controlled trials were identified, and also three ongoing trials. Data regarding recidivism while the interlock is installed in the vehicle; after the interlock has been removed from the vehicle and total recidivism during the study were extracted and entered into analyses using RevMan.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The RCT showed that the interlock programme was effective while the device was installed in the vehicle; relative risk 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.63). Controlled trials support this conclusion, with a general trend &#8722; in both first-time and repeat offenders &#8722; towards lower recidivism rates when the interlock device is installed. Neither the RCT nor the controlled trials provide evidence for any effectiveness of the programmes continuing once the device has been removed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In order to eliminate potential selection bias, more RCTs need to be conducted in this area so that effectiveness, as well as efficacy, can be ascertained. The interlock programme appears to be effective while the device is installed in the vehicle of the offender. Studies need to address ways of improving recidivism rates in the long term, as the major challenges are participation rates, compliance and durability.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-15 11:51:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Driving a car requires the interactions of a complex set of skills. <LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 1990</LINK> reviewed data relating to alcohol intake and the impairment of psychomotor, perception, tracking, attention, vision and information processing skills. The conclusion of the review was that there was no absolute threshold below which impairment did not occur, with some impairment occurring at even very low blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) (0.01 and 0.02% BAC).</P>
<P>Statistics on drink driving, and the increase in risk of injury to drivers and the public, are readily available; for example, from the web sites of state or national traffic governing bodies. 'Drink drivers' are not a homogeneous group. It would appear that multiple offenders are relatively resistant to rehabilitation. There may also be a subset of drivers with no prior drink driving conviction who are, nevertheless, habitual drink drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Collier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morse-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morse 1992</LINK>). Countermeasures available to dissuade persistent drink drivers include fines, incarceration, vehicle impoundment and licence revocation. Incarceration is costly, while the effect of vehicle impoundment is not limited to the drink driver (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1999</LINK>). Licence revocation has limitations, previous studies reporting that up to 75% of drivers with suspended licences continue to drive illegally (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaestner-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaestner 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staplin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staplin 1989</LINK>). It has also been noted that the probability of arrest while driving with a blood alcohol level over 0.10% is very low (about one in 200) (<LINK REF="REF-Beitel-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beitel 1975</LINK>). Although the study is old, the figure is one of the more conservative estimates. However, it has been shown that violators who receive licence revocation do modify their driving habits and drive fewer miles (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1988</LINK>). Such countermeasures rely on drink drivers choosing not to drive if they believe they will be caught and punished.</P>
<P>Improvements in alcohol-sensing technology, microprocessors and the development of relevant legislation have led to the development of alcohol ignition interlocks, which are now another tool in the drink driving countermeasures arsenal (<LINK REF="REF-Marques-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marques 2001b</LINK>). An ignition interlock device is part of a programme aimed to reduce recidivism in convicted drink drivers. To operate an ignition-interlocked vehicle, the driver must first provide a breath sample. The driver must present an alcohol concentration in the breath (BrAC) equivalent to the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that is lower than a preset threshold level, for it to be possible to start the vehicle. Drivers are randomly retested while the vehicle is running, to reduce circumvention of the device. Breath test attempts are logged into a data recorder. As the device does not allow the operation of the vehicle if the driver has consumed sufficient amounts of alcohol, the decision-making process of whether to drive is removed from the person under the influence of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The compliant offender retains driving privileges and may, therefore, continue to earn a livelihood and travel, while sober. The ignition interlock system is designed to affect the driver's behaviour by requiring a change in their habits related to drinking and driving, as it provides immediate feedback on inappropriate alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Weinrath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinrath 1997</LINK>). The complete programme often includes training in the use of the interlock and the return to an authorised service centre regularly for inspection, calibration checks, and downloading of the interlock data recorder. Usually the cost of installing and maintaining (including calibration of the machine) is borne by the driver.</P>
<P>Alcohol ignition interlocks are gaining acceptance, with legislation and programmes in countries such as America, Canada, Australia and feasibility studies currently under way in the European Union. Countries that offer an interlock programme have incentives such as reducing insurance premiums and reducing the time taken to get a licence reinstated. However, the literature suggests that less than 10% of convicted drink drivers choose to participate in the programme (<LINK REF="REF-Voas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 2002</LINK>). Those who opt for the interlock programme usually do so in exchange for shorter licence suspension time (<LINK REF="REF-Marques-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marques 2001a</LINK>). The low participation rates reduce the contribution of the ignition interlock in reducing drink driving in the recidivist population overall (<LINK REF="REF-Marques-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marques 2001b</LINK>).</P>

<P>One reviewer (CW) searched and located trials that were possibly relevant to the review. Two reviewers (CW and SL) independently applied the selection criteria. There was no disagreement regarding trials that were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two reviewers (CW and NB) then independently assessed the included trials for methodological quality. The RCT was assessed using Jadad's quality scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). There is no one best tool for assessing the quality of non-randomised controlled trials. For this review we needed a tool that was not based upon clinical trails (where a majority of the questions would be irrelevant). We decided that the tool would need to account for what we deemed were most important in the area of alcohol ignition interlocks:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>internal and external validity to be scored (i.e. the study is methodologically sound and the effects observed in the study are applicable outside of the study).</LI>
<LI>selection bias; were the groups similar at baseline</LI>
<LI>performance bias; is there a difference in care between the groups, other than that being evaluated</LI>
<LI>attrition bias; Intent to treat, describe those who did not complete the programme</LI>
<LI>level of study; RCT, cohort study, before-and-after</LI>
<LI>length of follow-up; was it the same for both groups, was it sufficiently long enough to show effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We then evaluated nine quality assessment tools against these criteria. Tools which would give no score to non-randomised trials (such as Jadad's) were excluded, as they would not produce meaningful results in this review. The tool that fulfilled the most requirements was <LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>. We then modified the tool to account for some specific areas of ignition interlocks. A copy of this quality assessment tool may be obtained from the Cochrane Injuries Group (cochrane_injuries@lshtm.ac.uk). The tool gave a rating score out of 27. All studies, including the RCT, were assessed for quality using this tool.</P>
<P>The following information was extracted (by CW and SL): recidivism while the interlock device is installed on the offender's vehicle, recidivism after the interlock device has been removed from the offender's vehicle, and total recidivism throughout the study period.</P>
<P>The primary analysis was based, for RCTs, on meta-analytic methods. Relative risk with random effects was calculated using RevMan 4.2.</P>
<P>Results from the non-RCTs have been considered in the discussion but have not formed a part of the meta-analysis, due to differences in methodology and potential biases. Results have been entered into RevMan Analyses only to aid in presenting the data; no totals are given.</P>

<P>HANCOCK COUNTY, Indiana (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-County" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock County</LINK>)<BR/>In 1992, legislation was passed in Hancock County that made ignition interlocks a part of sentencing for most multiple offenders.

Alcohol offenders who petitioned for, and were recommended for, relicensing and whose relicensing was approved were randomly assigned to the interlock or control programme. The interlock group were required to use the interlock for 12 months and were usually required to participate in mandatory treatment or support programmes. The control group were not allowed to drive after drinking any amount of alcohol and it was usually mandatory to participate in Maryland's Drinking Driving Monitoring programme. The control groups also had to report regularly to a court-approved probation monitor. Failure to comply for either group resulted in suspension of driving privileges. The arrest rates were compared between the two groups for one year, while the ignition interlock programme was in place, and for the year after unrestricted driving privileges were returned. The study design was intention-to-treat so that all participants randomised to the interlock programme were analysed as such, whether or not they had the device installed. If an interlock was not installed by 45 days after placement, the participant faced suspension for failure to comply.</P>

In Alberta, first-time offenders usually served three to six months of their suspension, then completed an eight-hour educational programme before being eligible for the interlock programme. Second-time offenders served at least two years of their suspension and completed a weekend intervention programme (IMPACT) before being eligible for the interlock programme. Participants had the interlock installed for six months, or until the end of their suspension. To be eligible for the interlock programme, drivers had to have no other DUI offences recorded against them (clean record) during their period of licence suspension. 8.9% of the offenders were eligible to participate in the interlock programme and of these, 6% were required to have the interlock installed.</P>
<P>CALIFORNIA (<LINK REF="STD-California" TYPE="STUDY">California</LINK>)<BR/>This study was the first interlock intervention study conducted in the US. The design was quasi-experimental with non-random assignment. The variable of principal interest was recidivism for DUI offenders. There was no set policy as to who would receive an interlock sentence (the interlock could be used at the discretion of local judges as an additional condition of probation); controls were drawn from the pool of DUI probationers who were convicted of the same primary charge. Controls had to match interlock participants on: date of conviction, age, gender, race, number of prior DUIs, and BAC level at arrest. Four counties in California participated, each with distinct local criminal justice systems. Only Santa Clara county used a device that produced a hard copy of the data log. Responsibility for compliance feedback was left to the manufacturers as DUI probation was not supervised. The manufacturer had to notify the courts to trigger the issuance of warrants for failure to comply. 62% of the devices were still installed in vehicles when the study ended.</P>
<P>COLORADO (<LINK REF="STD-Colorado" TYPE="STUDY">Colorado</LINK>)<BR/>In 1995, a voluntary alcohol ignition interlock pilot programme was authorized. In 1999, legislation mandated a one-year interlock installation for drivers with two or more alcohol offences, within a five-year period, at the time of licence reinstatement. To participate in the voluntary programme, offenders must have applied for an Interlock-Probationary Licence (I-PDL). To do so, they must have provided proof of insurance and have attended a hearing. The groups used in this trial were participants who had the interlock installed , applicants who went through the application procedure but decided not to install an interlock (who were followed for one year), and a random sample of offenders who did not apply for an I-PDL (who were followed for one year).</P>
<P>HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-County" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton County</LINK>)<BR/>This study comprises the data collected over the first 30 months of the quasi-experimental, longitudinal Hamilton County Drinking and Driving Study. Eligibility for the study was limited to: a) all first-time offenders with a BAC of 0.02 or higher at arrest, b) repeat offenders convicted of DUI two or more times within the last ten years, and c) offenders who refused a BAC test at the time of their arrest. Judges had the option of offering two sentences to eligible offenders. The first was a suspended licence with driving restricted to an interlock-equipped vehicle; the second was licence suspension sanctions and probation terms. Offenders offered the interlock option could accept, or refuse and serve out their original licence suspension and probation period.</P>
<P>ILLINOIS (<LINK REF="STD-Illinois" TYPE="STUDY">Illinois</LINK>)<BR/>The participants in the interlock programme were multiple DUI offenders who had obtained a Restricted Driving Permit (RDP). A legislative change which took place July 1 1994, required an ignition interlock for anyone who lost their licence for DUI and who subsequently applied for a RDP. The interlock group consisted of those who received a RDP from July 1 1994 through to June 30 1997, while the control group comprised those who received an RDP between 1st July 1991 through to 30th June 1994. The interlock device was installed for one year.</P>
<P>NORTH CAROLINA (<LINK REF="STD-North-Carolina" TYPE="STUDY">North Carolina</LINK>)<BR/>All drivers convicted for the second time of DWI received a four-year licence suspension. At the end of the second year, offenders were eligible to apply for a conditional licence. This was a quasi-experimental design of second-time DWI offenders to examine recidivism rates. Four groups of drivers convicted of their second offence were assigned: 1) non-application, 2) denied licence (including those offered the interlock but who declined), 3) interlock and 4) conditional licence. However, for this review, we chose to compare the following two groups; 407 interlock participants and 916 conditional licence controls.</P>
<P>OREGON (<LINK REF="STD-Oregon" TYPE="STUDY">Oregon</LINK>) 
<BR/>
Oregon usually waives prosecution for first-time offenders who enrol in an alcohol rehabilitation/treatment programme, and the first conviction is usually the second offence. The interlock group are nearly always repeat offenders or the interlock programme was a requirement for hardship licence applicants. At the end of the one to three year DWI suspension, offenders must use the ignition interlock device for six months or face an additional six months suspension. Eleven of 36 counties in Oregon use the interlock programme. Subjects were selected from driver record files. Results were for the six months when an interlock was required, and an average of 406 days after the requirement expired. As this study showed that reinstatement of a licence at the end of the suspension period was a cofactor that affected the results of the study, we chose to compare the ignition interlock device-installed group to the control group who later reinstated.</P>
<P>QUEBEC (<LINK REF="STD-Quebec" TYPE="STUDY">Quebec</LINK>)<BR/>An ignition interlock programme started in December 1997. For first-time offenders, the interlock reduced their suspension sentence by nine months (i.e. three months suspension plus nine months interlock) and (until July 1999) an 18-month reduction for second time offenders (i.e. six month suspension plus 18 months interlock). Second-time offenders (after July 1999) were no longer eligible for the interlock, as they were required to complete a minimum two-year suspension. This study is a cohort study comprised of a study group of convicted offenders who took part in the ignition interlock programme and a control group of convicted offenders who did not participate. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>WEST VIRGINIA (<LINK REF="STD-West-Virginia" TYPE="STUDY">West Virginia</LINK>)<BR/>Participants in this programme had to be enrolled in, or have completed the "Safety and Treatment Program" and could not have had a conviction recorded against them of driving while their licence was revoked or suspended in the previous two years. Controls were offenders who had elected not to participate. First-time offenders were required to have the interlock installed in the vehicle for five months, while second offenders were required to participate for 12 months. In June 1994, this requirement was increased to 18 months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ongoing programmes</HEADING>
<P>QUEENSLAND (<LINK REF="STD-Queensland" TYPE="STUDY">Queensland</LINK>)<BR/>This trial commenced in February 2001. The interlock programme is open to all types of offenders. Offenders have full licence disqualification, during which they complete a rehabilitation programme called 'Under The Limit'. The programme is run through the courts. Courts are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control arm. If assigned to the treatment, following suspension, offenders either are on probation or can install an interlock device for the remainder of the sanctioning period. Participation is to be voluntary. There are two control groups, one from the courts randomised to the control group and another control group formed by the people who decline the interlock. Offenders are monitored by a Community Corrections Officer. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, those who breach the conditions of probation will face actions such as receiving written censure, or being sent back to court to have their sentences re-evaluated. Analysis: survival analysis of rates of re-offence.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>SWEDEN (<LINK REF="STD-Sweden" TYPE="STUDY">Sweden</LINK>)<BR/>Three of Sweden's 21 counties are in the experiment programme. Sweden's first interlock was installed in March 1999. Offenders remain on the interlock programme for two years. After one year, biomedical indicators of alcohol use have to be consistent with those of a 'normal' person. The interlock recorder is checked every second month. The number of 'fails' on the device is limited. If a person does not have normal biomedical indicators or too many positive BACs recorded on the interlock device, the person will be removed from the programme and suspension ensues. There are two control groups comprising: 1) a group of those who did not participate in the interlock programme (called K2), 2) a group residing in counties not taking part in the programme (called K1). There were 285 interlock participants as at 2002; number of controls is not stated.</P>
<P>Concern: offenders who cannot maintain 'normal' biomedical indicators are removed from the programme. This means that those who remain on the programme are more motivated to succeed and may inflate the success rate of the programme, unless an 'intention-to-treat' analysis is used.</P>
<P>VICTORIA (<LINK REF="STD-Victoria" TYPE="STUDY">Victoria</LINK>)<BR/>This trial commenced in May 2003, one year after legislation was passed. Participation in the interlock programme is discretionary, through the courts, and is for two groups of offenders. In the first group are offenders who had a BAC of at least 0.15 or a non-BAC offence. These people have a licence suspension for a minimum of 15 months and then if required, an interlock for a minimum of six months. Repeat offenders who either had three or more offences OR multiple offences where the last offence was a BAC of at least 0.15 or a non-BAC offence. These people receive a 12 or 30 months minimum suspension and then a three-year minimum interlock requirement. If the offender had two prior offences and the last offence had a BAC of under 0.15, the offender receives a minimum 12 month suspension and six months minimum interlock requirement.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-08 22:00:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fourteen studies are included in this systematic review. See the notes section in the included studies table for concerns regarding specific studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomised controlled trial</HEADING>
<P>The study (<LINK REF="STD-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">Maryland</LINK>) is limited to those offenders who had demonstrated an ability to comply with prescribed treatments and were approved for relicensing by the state's Medical Advisory Board. Therefore, this study does not evaluate the effectiveness of the interlock on the less motivated repeat drink driver, as there is a selection bias towards those offenders who had overcome their drink driving habit. The authors were contacted for the randomisation procedure. A computer programme generated 1400 random assignment cards (700 that read "interlock" and 700 that read "control"). These cards were placed into separate envelopes consecutively numbered from one to 1400. Offenders granted approval for relicensing were assigned a case number and only then was the envelope opened. Analysis was "intention to treat".</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>The studies of this type have shown various methodological problems. Three of the controlled trials were administered through the courts. Without randomisation, this method can lead to judicial bias; i.e. judges may choose offenders with certain characteristics for the intervention group. Also, courts may not have the resources to screen drivers and monitor/enforce licence restrictions. However, involvement of the courts can produce a higher motivational factor, as not complying can lead to heavier penalties, whereas administrative departments can only determine whether or not a licence is reinstated.</P>
<P>Only one study had mandatory participation, despite which only 62% of the target population where recruited. Some programmes were 'semi-mandatory' (i.e. offenders had to install an interlock to regain their licence) but applying for an licence was voluntary. This gives rise to self-selection bias, whereby those who choose to participate in the programme may be more motivated to succeed. It also means that comparison groups are then usually made up of those people who refused to participate in the intervention.</P>
<P>Four of the studies had a control group in which people were legally allowed to drive and, therefore, would potentially have the same exposure 'on the road' as those who had an interlock installed. The other studies have control groups which were still suspended, potentially being more cautious and driving less miles, which would therefore limit the exposure to being caught.</P>
<P>The initial results from the quality assessment of trials was disappointing with an agreement rate of only 61%. However, upon examination of the disagreements it became obvious that part of the low agreement rate was due to interpretation differences in the wording used in the assessment tool. These interpretation differences were discussed and resolved. On removing those questions where there was 70% or higher disagreement (i.e. interpretation differences) the agreement rate rose to 80%. After discussing the remain areas of disagreement, CW and NB came to a 100% agreement rate and no arbitration was necessary. Final scores are given in the included studies table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In the RCT included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Maryland" TYPE="STUDY">Maryland</LINK>), recidivism was lower in the intervention group while the device was still installed in the vehicle; relative risk 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.63). The benefit disappeared once the device was removed; relative risk 1.33 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 2.46). The results from the post-interlock period severely effect the overall effectiveness of the interlock, when both the interlock and post-interlock periods are combined.</P>
<P>In all 13 non-randomised controlled trials, interlock participants again had lower recidivism than the controls. In nine of the trials, the difference between the groups would be regarded as statistically significant (i.e. the 95% CI does not include the value 1.0); see Analysis Figure 2. In repeat offenders, the evidence is stronger with six of the eight studies showing that the offenders have significantly lower recidivism rates while the device is installed in the vehicle. Once again, however, the favourable result does not extend to the time period after the interlock is removed.</P>
<P>The two controlled trials which reported an overall effect both showed that the interlock did not reduce recidivism in the drink driving population.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has found evidence that the ignition interlock has the ability to curb drinking and driving when it is installed in a vehicle but that the benefit disappears once the device is removed. The overall effectiveness of the device is, therefore, questionable from a traffic safety point of view.</P>
<P>However, the review also found that, while numerous trials have been conducted in the area of alcohol ignition interlock programmes, only one has been an RCT. An RCT limits various sources of potential bias in a study. As noted, the RCT in this review did not evaluate the effectiveness of the interlock on the less motivated repeat drink driver, as there was selection bias towards those offenders who had overcome their drink driving habit. </P>
<P>All non-randomised controlled trials are subject to bias and may limit the extrapolation that the intervention can work in the general population of offenders. The low participation rates in the non-randomised trials in this review are also of concern. Further concerns regarding individual trials have also been noted &#8722; see Table of included studies. In consequence, the strength of the review's findings are weakened. The question of the effectiveness of alcohol ignition interlock programmes has yet to be answered. One RCT, and the low participation rates, have not allowed the rigorous testing that this device requires. </P>
<P>For public safety, an effective sentence needs to be based on the merits and demerits of the defendant (<LINK REF="REF-Raub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raub 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Voas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voas 1999</LINK> used as a measure of programme effectiveness, the overall recidivism rates for participants and non-participants. However, the numbers of participants was so small as to have a negligible effect (6% decrease) on the overall recidivism rate. Voas et al state that, "unless a procedure is found to increase the offender participation rate, interlock programmes will have limited value as an overall control method for all DUIs." Other questions raised by this group are: the effect of mandatory versus voluntary participation (<LINK REF="REF-Beirness-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirness 2000a</LINK>), different support services provided with the interlock device (<LINK REF="REF-Marques-2000c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marques 2000c</LINK>), and whether using failed BAC tests recorded by the device can predict future recidivism rates (<LINK REF="REF-Marques-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marques 2000b</LINK>). Not withstanding methodological challenges and data limitations, alcohol ignition interlock programmes have the potential to reduce the frequency of DUI and may favourably influence the burden and costs of alcohol-related road traffic accidents. Strategies to improve participation rates, compliance and durability of effect are particularly challenging.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review confirms that the ignition interlock reduces recidivism, while installed in a vehicle. The majority of the evidence supports the conclusion that the interlock device has no long-term effects for reducing recidivism in the population of drivers that use them. Also, the percentage of drivers who have participated in these programmes is so low that the device has had little effect on the drink driving population as a whole. Most studies have concluded that participation rates need to be increased, in order for the ignition interlock programme to have effects on the drink driving population at large.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is some evidence that rehabilitation programmes coupled with the interlock device have positive effects for maintaining a reduced level of recidivism after the interlock has been removed. The emerging data for predicting repeat offenders from the interlock data logs is interesting and needs to be followed up. The population which is best affected by the interlock has yet to be defined. Also, further research needs to investigate whether increasing the length of time (perhaps indefinitely) the interlock device is installed in the drink driving recidivist vehicle will decrease recidivism.</P>
