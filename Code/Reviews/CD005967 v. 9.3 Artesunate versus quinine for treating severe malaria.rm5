<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-10 09:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Severe malaria occurs when infection with the malaria parasite is complicated by serious failure of the body's major organs, and results in over a million deaths every year. Sometimes severe malaria is associated with coma and is known as cerebral malaria. Following cerebral malaria a small proportion of children suffer with long-term neurological disability.</P>
<P>This review of trials assessed the effectiveness of artesunate compared with the standard treatment quinine. Eight trials involving 1664 adults and 5765 children were identified, from study sites in Asia and Africa.</P>
<P>Treating adults in Asia with artesunate instead of quinine would prevent an extra 94 deaths for every 1000 patients treated. In trials involving children, the proportion of deaths was lower than in the trials involving adults. This lower risk of death results in a smaller benefit in children than in adults, but would still save an extra 26 lives for every 1000 children treated.</P>
<P>In the children who survived their illness, there were more neurological problems at the time of hospital discharge in those treated with artesunate than those treated with quinine. However, the majority of these neurological problems had resolved when they were reviewed 28 days later, and at this timepoint there was no difference between the two treatment groups.</P>
<P>Artesunate should be the drug of choice for adults and children with severe malaria worldwide.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-09 12:00:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a febrile illness caused by infection with the <I>Plasmodium</I> parasite, which is transmitted from person to person by mosquitos. Five species of plasmodium are known to cause disease in humans: <I>P. falciparum</I>, <I>P. vivax</I>, <I>P. ovale</I>, <I>P. malariae</I>, and <I>P knowlesi </I>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). <I>P. falciparum </I>is the most common malaria parasite worldwide, and is responsible for almost all of the severe disease and deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Repeated exposure to malaria infection over 5 to 10 years can produce a naturally acquired immunity in humans, which is protective against the most severe forms of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Doolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doolan 2009</LINK>). Consequently, in high transmission settings as seen in large parts of Africa, young children are most at risk prior to the acquisition of effective immunity, whereas in low transmission settings, or in travellers from non-endemic areas, adults are often equally vulnerable to severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Severe malaria is diagnosed on the basis of a positive blood slide or antigen test for malaria, plus the presence of clinical or laboratory markers which indicate vital organ dysfunction. These markers include impaired consciousness, coma, convulsions, respiratory distress, shock (systolic blood pressure &lt; 70 mmHg in adults, &lt; 50 mmHg in children), jaundice, haemoglobinuria, or severe acidosis or anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Cerebral malaria is a specific type of severe malaria characterised by an unrousable coma. Even with correct treatment cerebral malaria can have a mortality rate approaching 20%, and persistent neurological sequelae are seen in a small proportion of survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffar 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard treatment for severe malaria has been an intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection of quinine (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). A loading dose of 20 mg/kg is recommended to reduce the time needed to reach effective concentrations in the blood, with subsequent dosing at 10 mg/kg at eight hourly intervals (<LINK REF="REF-White-1983b" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Der-Torn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Der Torn 1996</LINK>). A Cochrane Review found a significant reduction in fever clearance time and parasite clearance time with a loading dose compared with no loading dose but concluded that data were insufficient to demonstrate an impact on mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lesi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects resulting from quinine therapy are common. Cinchonism (symptoms of quinine overdose) often occurs with conventional dose regimens. This usually mild and reversible symptom complex consists of tinnitus, deafness, dizziness, and vomiting, and may affect adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Alkadi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alkadi 2007</LINK>). Hypoglycaemia is a less common but more serious adverse effect (<LINK REF="REF-White-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1983</LINK>). Toxic levels of quinine can occur following rapid intravenous administration and can result in heart rhythm disturbances, blindness, coma, and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Alkadi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alkadi 2007</LINK>). In addition, there is limited evidence that the efficacy of quinine in severe malaria may be declining in some parts of South-East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Wongsrichanalai-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wongsrichanalai 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-05-09 11:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Artesunate is one of a number of antimalarials derived from artemisinin, the active ingredient in a Chinese herbal remedy for fever, <I>Artemesia annua. </I>The artemisinin derivatives are now the recommended treatment for uncomplicated (less severe) malaria, when they are given orally in combination with a partner drug, as Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT), to delay or prevent the development of artemisinin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The artemisinin derivatives are generally regarded as safe in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alkadi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alkadi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2007</LINK>). Animal studies using very high doses of artemisinins have demonstrated focal brain stem lesions particularly affecting the auditory pathways (<LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nontprasert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nontprasert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Genovese-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genovese 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nontprasert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nontprasert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nontprasert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nontprasert 2002</LINK>), but studies of brain stem function in humans, including audiometry, have failed to show any abnormality following repeated courses (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kissinger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissinger 2000</LINK>). To date, only one nested case-control study has demonstrated a significant audiometric hearing loss in factory workers treated with artemether-lumefantrine for uncomplicated malaria compared with workers with no history of exposure to malaria infection or artemether-lumefantrine (<LINK REF="REF-Toovey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toovey 2004</LINK>). This result needs to be interpreted with caution due to a number of design limitations.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-05-09 12:00:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deaths from severe malaria often occur during the first 24 to 48 hours following hospital admission. Consequently, to be effective antimalarial drugs need to achieve rapid therapeutic blood concentrations following administration.</P>
<P>Compared to quinine, the artemisinin derivatives have been shown to clear malaria parasites from the blood faster, and to have a broader spectrum of activity (<LINK REF="REF-ter-Kuile-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Kuile 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adjuik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adjuik 2004</LINK>). Importantly they are effective against young ring forms of the parasite before they sequester in the microcirculation of vital organs, a major pathophysiological step in the development of severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-ter-Kuile-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Kuile 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Artesunate is the most studied artemisinin-derivative for the treatment of severe malaria and may be given by intramuscular or intravenous injection. It has been shown to reliably reach peak concentrations within one hour of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Nealon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nealon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hien-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hien 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the alternatives, artemether and arteether are available as oil-based, intramuscular formulations. Artemether is prone to erratic and partial absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Karbwang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karbwang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mithwani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mithwani 2003</LINK>), and arteether to low peak concentrations and slow absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2004</LINK>). Systematic reviews of artemether and arteether compared to quinine have so far failed to show a reduction in mortality compared to quinine therapy, although the data are limited (<LINK REF="REF-AQMSG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AQMSG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Afolabi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afolabi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kyu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyu 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-23 13:20:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane Review prepared in year 2000 assessed the effects of the artemisinin derivatives, including artesunate, for treating severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2000</LINK>). This review has since been superseded by a series of Cochrane Reviews examining the different artemisinin derivatives.</P>
<P>This review was first published in 2006 and demonstrated the superiority of artesunate for treating adults in Asia, but found insufficient data to make firm conclusions in children. This update includes two additional, recently completed trials, focusing on artesunate versus quinine in African children.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death</HEADING>
<P>Treatment with artesunate significantly reduced the risk of death both in adults (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75; 1664 participants, five trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and children (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90; 5765 participants, four trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). This reduction was consistent across all trials regardless of participant age or geographic region (I<SUP>2</SUP> test for statistical heterogeneity = 0%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality was lower in the trials recruiting children and consequently the absolute reduction in mortality is lower than that seen in adults (absolute risk reduction: adults: 94 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients, 95% CI 60 fewer to 120 fewer; children: 26 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients, 95% CI 11 fewer to 38 fewer; see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 1</LINK>). This age effect is confounded by region, with the majority of the data in children coming from Africa (where the trial mortality was relatively low), and all the data in adults coming from Asia (where the trial mortality was higher).</P>
<P>Three trials report a subgroup analyses of deaths occurring within the first 48 hours following admission (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Newton 2003</LINK>) and one trial reports the number of deaths occurring within the first 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>). Although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance during these early time periods there were consistently fewer deaths in the groups treated with artesunate (6163 participants, four trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the significant variation in trial design we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding trials with inadequate allocation concealment, trials only included patients with cerebral malaria, and those with no loading dose of quinine, but these did not alter the significance of the result.</P>
<P>The two large multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) conducted multiple subgroup analyses according to the presence or absence of coma, anaemia, shock, acidosis, respiratory distress, or hyperparasitaemia at the time of admission. Mortality was consistently lower with artesunate in all of these subgroups but some were underpowered to show statistically significant differences.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neurological sequelae</HEADING>

Of these three trials, only <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK> included adults, and the incidence of neurological sequelae seems to be very low in this group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial in children (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) followed participants up until day 28 to see if these sequelae resolved. Of the 170 children with sequelae at the time of discharge, 129 (75.9%) were available for assessment on day 28, and 68 of these (52.7%) had fully recovered. At this time point the difference between groups was not statistically significant (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.03; 4857 participants, one trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Coma recovery time</HEADING>
<P>Six trials report a measure of coma recovery time (<LINK REF="STD-Anh-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Anh 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Anh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cao-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltahir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Eltahir 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hien-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hien 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Newton 2003</LINK>). The frequency of clinical monitoring to assess coma recovery varied between these trials and is likely to have influenced the result (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported mean coma recovery time but the data from <LINK REF="STD-Eltahir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Eltahir 2010</LINK> were incompletely reported. There is no evidence of a difference between the groups, the data are skewed and the results inconsistent (231 participants, two trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Three trials reported median coma recovery time and again the results were inconsistent and no conclusions can be made (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition the two large multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) report median time to speak, and <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK> reports median time to localise pain (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK> found the time to speak and localise pain to be slightly prolonged in those treated with artesunate but the clinical significance of this is unclear (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<P>No trial reported discontinuation of medication. With the exception of hypoglycaemia and tinnitus, all adverse effects reported could be attributable to malaria.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential benefits of treating severe malaria with artesunate instead of quinine</HEADING>
<P>Treating severe malaria with artesunate instead of quinine reduces the risk of death by 39% in adults (95% CI 25% to 50%), and 24% in children (95% CI 10% to 35%).</P>
<P>Artesunate also reduces episodes of hypoglycaemia during treatment by 45% (95% CI 26% to 59%).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential harms of treating severe malaria with artesunate instead of quinine</HEADING>
<P>In adults neurological sequelae following treatment for severe malaria appears to be very low (&lt; 1 %) and no difference has been shown between artesunate and quinine.</P>
<P>In children, treatment with artesunate appears to increase the incidence of neurological sequelae at the time of hospital discharge but the majority of these sequelae seem to resolve with time, and there is no evidence of a difference between the two treatments 28 days later.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-05-09 15:36:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes trials from multiple countries within Africa and Asia where malaria is most prevalent. Although there are no trials from South America it would be reasonable to generalise these findings to all geographic regions.</P>
<P>There is now adequate evidence to be confident of the results in both adults and children. However, it should be noted that these trials did not include a significant number of pregnant women.</P>
<P>Based on this trial data the absolute benefit in children appears lower than that seen in adults, primarily due to the lower mortality seen in children. This observation may be related to regional differences rather than participant age as the majority of child data is from Africa, and all the adult data is from Asia. Potential reasons for the lower risk of mortality seen in children in <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK> include: inclusion of 'less severe' malaria, increased efficacy of quinine in Africa or true differences in the risk of death related to acquisition of partial immunity in Africa.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-05-09 15:31:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although several of the smaller trials suffer from methodological problems such as open randomization, unmatched additional oral antimalarials, or non-standard dosing, these do not affect the overall quality of the evidence as the majority of the data is from large multicentre trials which do not suffer the same problems.</P>
<P>We consider the evidence for a reduction in mortality with artesunate to be high quality, and further research to establish this is unnecessary (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The increase in neurological sequelae is of a smaller magnitude than the reduction in deaths and seems to be temporary. The balance of benefits and harms is in favour of benefit with artesunate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Economic commentary</HEADING>
<P>To supplement the main systematic review of the effects on artesunate in the management of severe malaria, we sought to identify economic evaluations which compared the use of artesunate with the use of quinine. Systematic supplementary searches of the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) identified four articles using the search terms outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The articles were then screened for inclusion and two were discarded as they evaluated the use of rectal artesunate.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Lubell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubell 2009</LINK> is a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the large multicentre trial of artesunate in Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>), and <LINK REF="REF-Lubell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubell 2011</LINK> is based on the large multicentre trial from sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>). Both studies take the service-provider&#8217;s perspective, calculating the total costs to the health service, and no estimate was made of the economical benefit to the individual or society.</P>
<P>In both studies, the total cost of care using artesunate was marginally higher per patient than using quinine (in Asia: US$43.0 vs. US$32.4; in Africa: US$66.5 vs. US$63.5). However, given the large treatment effect of artesunate, the incremental cost per additional death averted was less than US$140 in both studies. For a brief summary of these two studies see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>It is important to highlight that neither of the identified economic evaluations were subjected to any formal critical appraisal and we do not attempt to draw any firm or general conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of artesunate compared with quinine for the treatment of severe malaria. However, the available evidence indicates that, from an economic perspective, the use of artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria is a promising strategy when compared with quinine. Combined with the clinical data and the WHO treatment guidelines, this information may prove useful to those with responsibility for making local, regional, or national decisions regarding the management of individuals with severe malaria. However, end users of this review will need to assess the extent to which the economic evidence presented here may be applicable to their own setting.</P>

<P>Further research to examine the efficacy of artesunate versus quinine in children and adults is unnecessary. The safety of artesunate in pregnancy still needs to be determined, and trials are underway to examine the effects of artesunate when given repeatedly for multiple episodes of malaria. Toxicity from repeated dosing can not be ruled out on the basis of the evidence included in this review. Particular attention should be paid to the incidence of neurological sequelae.</P>

<P>We subgrouped "neurological sequelae" into "neurological sequelae at discharge" and "neurological sequelae at day 28".</P>
<P>We added a number of sensitivity analyses post-hoc after noting significant variation in study design across trials.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> One large multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) and two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eltahir-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Eltahir 2010</LINK>) have assessed artesunate vs quinine in children aged &lt; 15 years. In addition one large multicentre study included a subgroup of children in this age group (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>)<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> No serious study limitations: All the trials adequately concealed allocation to be considered at low risk of bias. The trials were unblinded but this is unlikely to bias this objective outcome<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious inconsistency: There was no statistical heterogeneity between the trials (I² = 0%).<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No serious indirectness: Most of the data is from <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK> which had centres in Mozambique, the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and used the established standard doses of artesunate and quinine (with loading dose). Of note the median age of children in this trial was 2.9 years in the quinine group and 2.8 in the artesunate group.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> No serious imprecision: Both limits of the 95% CI of the pooled effect imply an appreciable clinical benefit with artesunate. The Number Needed To Treat to prevent one childhood death is 38.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Only one large multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) reports this outcome.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> Serious study limitations: 41/170 (24%) patients with neurological sequelae at discharge were not available for assessment at day 28.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> No serious inconsistency: Not applicable as only one trial.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> No serious indirectness: This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>) had 11 centres throughout Africa and used the standard dosing of artesunate and quinine. The nature of the neurological sequelae is not described.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> No serious Imprecision: The 95% CI around the absolute effect is narrow. The worst case scenario is a 1.2% increase in neurological sequelae at day 28<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Cao-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1997</LINK>) report this outcome<SUP> </SUP>
<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP> Serious imprecision: The effect estimate is of a clinically important harm. However the 95% CI includes the possibility of no clinically important difference between the two interventions.<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP> No serious inconsistency: None of the trials found evidence of an important difference between the two treatment groups<BR/>
<SUP>14</SUP> Serious imprecision: We were unable to pool the data as they were only reported as medians and range/intra quartile range. There is no evidence of a clinically important benefit with artesunate on this outcome.<BR/>
<SUP>15</SUP> No serious imprecision: The result is statistically significant in favour of artesunate. The current sample size is adequately powered to detect a 40% risk reduction with 80% power and 95% confidence.</P>

However the majority of the data is from studies which did conceal allocation and the lack of blinding is unlikely to introduce bias for an objective outcome such as death.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious inconsistency: The point estimates of all five trials favoured artesunate. No significant statistical heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%).<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No serious indirectness: All five trials were from Asia, but from a variety of settings (Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand), and included age groups above 15/16 years. Of the four small trials; two did not give the loading dose of quinine, but there was no statistical heterogeneity between these two trials and the large multicentre trial which did give the loading dose.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> No serious imprecision: Both limits of the 95% CI imply a clinically important benefit with artesunate.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Only one trial reported the incidence of neurological sequelae in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK>). This is unpublished data received from the authors.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> No serious study limitations: This trial was unblinded but the nature of the sequelae makes an observer or reporting bias unlikely<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> No serious inconsistency: Not applicable as only one trial<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> No serious indirectness: This trial had sites in four different countries in Asia and used the established standard doses of artesunate and quinine (with loading dose). Of the 10 sequelae which occurred in this trial (the additional two were in children): Five were psychiatric sequelae, four were a persistent problem with balance, and two had a hemiparesis.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Serious imprecision: Neurological sequelae appear to be a rare event following severe malaria in adults. However the 95% CI includes the possibility of a clinically important harm with artesunate.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Newton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Newton 2003</LINK>) report this outcome.<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP> No serious study limitations: <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK> adequately concealed allocation to be considered at low risk of bias, <LINK REF="STD-Newton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Newton 2003</LINK> did not but is a much smaller trial. Neither trial was blinded<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP> No serious inconsistency: Neither trial found a statistically significant difference in time to hospital discharge<BR/>
<SUP>14</SUP> No serious indirectness: This evidence is from multiple sites within Asia (Bangladesh, India, Myanmarand Indonesia) and both trials used standard drug doses. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Dondorp-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dondorp 2005</LINK> does include some children.<BR/>
<SUP>15</SUP> Serious imprecision: We were unable to pool data due to the way data were presented but there is no evidence of a benefit on this outcome with artesunate.<BR/>
<SUP>16</SUP> No serious inconsistency: There was no statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0%)<BR/>
<SUP>17</SUP> No serious imprecision: This result is statistically significant in favour of artesunate. The current sample size is adequately powered to detect a 75% risk reduction with 80% power and 95% confidence.</P>
