<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of aspirin used with the aim of increasing the chance of live birth in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Aspirin has been commonly used in an attempt to increase the chance of live birth in women undergoing ART. However, there is contradictory evidence on the effectiveness of this treatment and on the appropriate time to commence treatment and its duration. Although physiologically aspirin exerts a beneficial effect on some aspects required for a successful pregnancy, aspirin intake has been also associated with miscarriage and vaginal bleeding. It was, therefore, important to evaluate current evidence on the effectiveness of this treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We found 13 randomised controlled trials with parallel groups, comparing aspirin with placebo or no treatment in a total of 2653 women undergoing ART. Studies were conducted in the USA and a variety of countries in Europe and Asia. One of the included trials was partly funded by a pharmaceutical company relevant to the intervention. In most of the studies, groups were comparable and the mean age of participants in both groups was 32 years. An identical dose of the intervention was administered in most of the studies and most reported a similar timing of the initiation of aspirin intake. The duration of trial varied across the studies, but was sufficient to provide data on the reported outcomes as respectively investigated by each group. The evidence is current to 9 May 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or vaginal bleeding. The number of studies was limited and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, while data on complication rates, either during the IVF/ICSI procedure or during pregnancy and childbirth were either very limited or missing. At this second update we were not able to add new data from additional studies, as we found no new RCTs reporting on these outcomes in the prespecified comparisons. Based on the available evidence, we reached the same conclusion as the initial version of the review: no single outcome measure demonstrated a benefit with the use of aspirin. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of aspirin treatment in order to improve pregnancy rates for a general IVF population.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The evidence was of moderate quality for live birth and of very low to moderate quality for other outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, publication bias and lack of studies investigating the desired outcomes.<BR/>

<P>Aspirin is used with the aim of optimising the chance of live birth in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), despite inconsistent evidence of its efficacy and safety (in terms of intraoperative bleeding during oocyte retrieval and risk of miscarriage). The most appropriate time to commence aspirin therapy and the length of treatment required are also still to be determined. This is the second update of the review first published in 2007.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched 9 May 2016); the databases MEDLINE (1946 to 9 May 2016) and Embase (1974 to 9 May 2016); and trial registers (<A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> and the <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal</A>). We also examined the reference lists of all known primary studies and review articles, citation lists of relevant publications and abstracts of major scientific meetings, combined with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's search strategy.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-19 08:53:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcome was live birth. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and other complications associated with IVF/ICSI or with pregnancy and birth. We combined data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) (for dichotomous data) and mean differences (MDs) (for continuous data) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-31 09:17:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search identified 13 trials as eligible for inclusion in the review, including a total of 2653 participants with a mean age of 35 years. Ten studies used a dose of 100 mg and three used 80 mg of aspirin per day. In most of them, aspirin was commenced immediately at the start of down-regulation, while the duration of treatment varied widely. Eight studies provided a placebo for the control group.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the aspirin group and the group receiving no treatment or placebo in rates of live birth (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15, 3 RCTs, n = 1053, I = 15%, moderate-quality evidence). In addition, clinical pregnancy rates were also similar for the two groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17, 10 RCTs, n = 2142, I = 27%, moderate-quality evidence); sensitivity analysis, excluding studies at high risk of bias, did not change the effect estimate. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of multiple pregnancy as confirmed by ultrasound (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.25, 2 RCTs, n = 656, I = 0%, low-quality evidence), miscarriage (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.77, 5 RCTs, n = 1497, I = 0%, low-quality evidence), ectopic pregnancy (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.63, 3 RCTs, n = 1135, I = 0%, very low quality evidence) or vaginal bleeding (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.13, 1 RCT, n = 487, very low quality evidence). Data were lacking on other adverse effects.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate; limitations were poor reporting of study methods and suspected publication bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-17 03:28:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently there is no evidence in favour of routine use of aspirin in order to improve pregnancy rates for a general IVF population. This is based on available data from randomised controlled trials, where there is currently no evidence of an effect of aspirin on women undergoing ART, as there is no single outcome measure demonstrating a benefit with its use. Furthermore, current evidence does not exclude the possibility of adverse effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-31 13:44:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-19 08:57:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assisted reproduction technologies (ART), and especially in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), have allowed a high degree of intervention in the physiological course of reproduction. The potential of pregnancy requires an embryo with increased implantation potential, a receptive endometrium and highly coordinated signalling and precise crosstalk between these interlinked sides. Unfortunately, success rates remain low. The majority of women undergoing IVF reach the transfer stage with good-quality embryos available for transfer, but only a small proportion of them ever achieve a live birth. More than 85% of the embryos placed into the uterine cavity fail to give a viable pregnancy. Different medical and non-medical strategies have been proposed to prevent this.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-19 08:57:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is widely known to reduce fever, pain and inflammation, but may cause stomach ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Flower-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flower 2003</LINK>). Long-term use of aspirin, even at low doses, is associated with bleeding in the digestive tract (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2000</LINK>). Its main method of action is the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin (a chemical in the body which promotes inflammation, fever and pain) by the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1971</LINK>); and subsequent reduction of platelet aggregation (making the blood less sticky and hence less likely to clot). There are two main types of cyclo-oxygenase: COX 1 and COX 2. COX 1-generated prostaglandins are required to maintain physiological functions (such as protection of the stomach lining, platelet aggregation) whereas COX 2 is involved in the production of an inflammatory response. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits both types, thus a single aspirin tablet can depress platelet aggregation for many days despite the short amount of time it takes for the body to break the drug down. Aspirin is broken down in the body by freeing the salicylate from the acetyl group, and salicylate may also inhibit cyclo-oxygenase.</P>
<P>As well as reducing fever or pain, aspirin has been used to treat or prevent other diseases including some forms of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bosetti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosetti 2002</LINK>). How these effects occur is unclear, though production of COX 2 is increased in many tumours and its suppression may restrict cancer cell growth or could activate the destruction of cancer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Thun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thun 2002</LINK>). Aspirin is widely used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-ISIS_x002d_3-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISIS-3 1992</LINK>); and its use has been linked to a reduction in Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1997</LINK>), again possibly by inhibiting COX 2.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-31 13:44:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Within the field of reproductive medicine, aspirin has been used to increase the weight of newborns in pregnant women with foetal growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Wallenburg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallenburg 1987</LINK>), to prevent recurrent unexplained foetal growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Yamaguchi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamaguchi 1985</LINK>), and to improve placental and foetal blood flow in women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Jouppilsa-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jouppilsa 1985</LINK>). Historically, aspirin has also been prescribed for women who had suffered recurrent miscarriages in the past, and for women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), in combination with heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Rai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rai 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of aspirin in women with infertility is controversial and the evidence is inconsistent (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2003</LINK>). Some papers have demonstrated a beneficial effect of aspirin in women undergoing assisted conception (<LINK REF="STD-Rubinstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rubinstein 1999</LINK>); whilst others have not (<LINK REF="STD-Urman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Urman 2000</LINK>). Proposed benefits of aspirin include improvement in uterine and ovarian blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Rubinstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rubinstein 1999</LINK>); and inhibition of platelet cyclo-oxygenase, thus inhibiting thromboxane synthesis and so preventing thrombosis in the placental vasculature. It may also be a potent stimulator of interleukin-3 (IL-3) in low doses through its ability to raise leukotriene production (proteins associated with pregnancy success) (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1995</LINK>). However, the pre-conceptual use of aspirin has been associated with increased miscarriage rates in retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>). As aspirin is thought to increase endometrial thickness, which is purported to increase implantation rates, aspirin therapy is often used to support intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment cycles in addition to traditional IVF.</P>
<P>The anti-platelet effect of aspirin lasts for about seven days after discontinuation and so consideration to excessive bleeding risk at the egg collection stage should be given, especially for empirical reasons. For women who are on anticoagulants for genuine reasons such as proven thrombophilias, previous thrombo-embolic events and cardiac patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2013</LINK>), a bridging plan should be established with their haematologist so as to minimise bleeding risk at egg collection versus thrombotic risk from their predisposed state and the hyperoestrogenic &#8212; and so hypercoagulable &#8212; state induced by the gonadotrophins used in assisted conception.</P>
<P>If indicated at all, when aspirin should be prescribed in an IVF treatment cycle is unclear. Possible times are: during down-regulation of the woman's own reproductive hormones; before administration of drugs to stimulate ovulation; after egg collection; or after confirmation of pregnancy either by a pregnancy test or when confirmed by ultrasound. Also unclear is when aspirin should be stopped, for example after 12 weeks gestation, at 34 weeks or at delivery.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-18 05:25:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Couples may feel desperate enough to try anything that may help in assisted conception. They may be aware of the use of aspirin in some assisted conception units but may also have heard of the association between aspirin use and risk of miscarriage and bleeding. It is essential that any medically prescribed drug is fully tested under rigorous trial conditions so that the potential benefits and risks are clear to both clinicians and the couples undergoing assisted conception treatment cycles. We updated a systematic review of the randomised controlled trial evidence on the use of aspirin in assisted conception. We intend that this will help guide both healthcare providers and consumers in their decision-making processes.</P>

<P>Aspirin, versus placebo, any other active intervention or no treatment, taken either pre-conceptually or at different stages of the treatment cycle (for example during down-regulation, during stimulation of ovulation, after oocyte collection or after confirmation of pregnancy by a pregnancy test or ultrasound). Aspirin treatment given for varying lengths of time was considered (for example up to different points in the treatment cycle; until confirmation of pregnancy; up to 12 weeks' gestation, 34 weeks' gestation or delivery). We defined low dose as a dose of 150 mg or less taken once per day. Trials reporting on the synchronous use of aspirin with any other treatment were excluded from the review.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-19 09:05:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During the update of this review, the search was largely supported by the Gynaecology and Fertility Group Information Specialist. C Siristatidis and P Vogiatzi independently selected trials among all potentially eligible studies and disagreements were resolved by discussion. The same two authors independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the update of the review. Further information was sought from the authors of studies where insufficient information was included in the papers to make a decision about eligibility; e-mails were sent seeking the necessary clarifications. In order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis for binary outcome measures, data were sought on the number of participants with each outcome event by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up.</P>
<P>During the initial version, from the trials identified by the above search strategies, V Poustie and A Drakeley independently selected trials which were eligible for inclusion based on the criteria for considering studies for the review (as detailed above). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or through arbitration by S Dodd. As a large number of studies were identified, V Poustie and A Drakeley independently screened the titles and discarded those studies that were clearly ineligible. The abstracts of the remaining studies were reviewed independently by V Poustie and A Drakeley. The full papers of any studies which appeared to be eligible, or for which we could not confirm eligibility, were obtained and reviewed independently. Further information was sought from the authors of studies where insufficient information was included in the papers to make a decision about eligibility. During the current update of the review, the same strategy was followed, performed by C Siristatidis and P Vogiatzi.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-10-19 09:05:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were extracted independently by C Siristatidis and P Vogiatzi using a data extraction form designed and pilot-tested by the authors and disagreements between the two aforementioned authors were resolved by consensus with G Basios. Where studies had multiple publications, the authors collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review, and such studies have a single study ID with multiple references. We sought additional information on trial methodology or actual original trial data from the principal author of trials which appeared to meet the eligibility criteria when aspects of methodology were unclear, or where the data were unpublished or in a form unsuitable for meta-analysis. The following quality criteria and methodological details are presented in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' and help provide a context for discussing the reliability of the results.</P>
<P>Analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5 software.</P>
<P>Where rates were reported, such that women may be counted more than once (for example 'per embryo transfer' or 'per cycle'), or reporting in percentages, rates 'per woman or couple' were calculated and reported if sufficient data were available, either extracted from papers or obtained from the trial authors. Binary outcome measures for each study were expressed and pooled using relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We presented relative risks in preference to odds ratios (OR) as they are more easily understood where event rates are high, as may have been the case in these studies.</P>

<P>The risk of bias of all studies that were deemed eligible for the review was assessed independently by C Siristatidis and G Basios.</P>
<P>The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<A HREF="http://handbook.cochrane.org">handbook.cochrane.org</A>) was used to assess: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. All judgements were fully described and presented in the conclusions through the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>

<P>For the assessment of the quality of evidence we prepared a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEpro and Cochrane methods. This table evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, vaginal bleeding and other adverse events) for the main review comparison. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. Two review authors (C Siristatidis and P Vogiatzi) independently conducted judgements about evidence quality, and resolved disagreements by discussion. Judgements were justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-19 11:24:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a total of 2653 participants that were recruited in randomised controlled trials assessing aspirin versus control (no intervention) in women undergoing ART. We found no evidence that aspirin had an effect on live birth rate in this population. We also found no evidence that aspirin intake can influence rates of clinical or ongoing or multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. However, the number of studies was limited and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Furthermore, data on complication rates, either during the IVF/ICSI procedure (intra-operative bleeding, vaginal/pelvic haematoma, blood transfusion, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, gastritis, haematemesis) or during pregnancy and childbirth (threatened miscarriage, antepartum haemorrhage, need for operative delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy) were either very limited or missing; therefore, to date, definitive conclusions are precluded.</P>
<P>Medical personnel involved in ART are mostly committed to offering couples adequate management towards achieving a successful clinical outcome: a pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby. It is imperative that before treatments become embedded in unit protocols they are subjected to rigorous, properly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled clinical trials. We must first do 'no harm', but it is also essential that purported treatments do actually convey benefit. Treatment with aspirin for IVF is one such treatment.</P>
<P>In an attempt to reassess whether aspirin administration is useful in increasing pregnancy rates in IVF and ICSI cycles, we performed a second update of a previously published Cochrane review on this issue. We were not able to add new data from additional studies, as we found no new RCTs reporting on these outcomes based on the desired comparisons. We have excluded 17 new studies. Based on the available evidence, we reached the same conclusion as the initial version of the review: no single outcome measure demonstrated a benefit with the use of aspirin.</P>
<P>Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of aspirin treatment in order to improve pregnancy rates for a general IVF population. Women undergoing IVF treatment are often prepared to undertake any number of measures to improve their chances of conceiving; therefore, recruitment targets in clinical trials of this treatment are likely to be achievable. Such women should be given the opportunity to participate in adequately powered, high-quality studies which aim to improve the evidence base for all couples requiring IVF treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-17 21:47:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The relevance of the evidence sourcing from the identified studies to the review question was borderline. Very few of them reported on all the objectives of the review question, especially live birth rate, which is ultimately the outcome all couples undergoing IVF are most interested in. The difficulty of collecting data at birth and the possible reporting bias of outcomes could justify such a lack. The small number of eligible studies identified and variations across studies in dose of treatment provided, stage of treatment in terms of commencement and cessation and use of placebo was not adequate. Lack of sufficient data on miscarriage rates associated with aspirin treatment is also a concern, particularly in light of evidence suggesting that higher doses of aspirin can result in increased miscarriage rates in pregnancy. Finally, a limitation of this second update of the review was the difficulty in identifying the full text of three new possibly eligible RCTs, while in two cases there was difficulty in assessing the risk of bias, whereas no new data were obtained in our correspondence effort.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-19 10:07:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the primary outcome, live birth, the evidence was of moderate quality. For clinical pregnancy, the evidence was of moderate quality: three studies failed to provide specifications on randomisation methods; two studies did not specify how allocation concealment was performed; one study was performed with inadequate blinding. In ongoing pregnancy the evidence was of low quality, as one study failed to provide specifications on the method of randomisation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>For other outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report study methods in sufficient detail and imprecision.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-19 10:07:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strength of the review in terms of preventing bias was maintained by having two independent review authors. The methods established to conduct the current review were agreed by all authors and any potential bias that could have been introduced was bypassed through independent screening, assessment, selection and data extraction with discrepancies resolved through team consensus. The search was supported by the CGFG Information Specialist. Importantly, relevant data were obtained by discussion between the three authors.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-19 10:07:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of the second update of this Cochrane review are in agreement with the current literature.</P>
<P>The first published systematic review and meta-analysis involved six trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gelbaya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelbaya 2007</LINK>). That review found no difference between patients who received aspirin and those who received placebo or no treatment in clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.29); and there were no differences in a variety of outcome measures studied, including live births. The authors concluded that aspirin had no substantial positive effect on likelihood of pregnancy and, therefore, it should not be routinely recommended for women undergoing IVF and ICSI.</P>
<P>Similarly, another meta-analysis of randomised trials evaluating the effects of aspirin in IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Ruopp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruopp 2008</LINK>), including 10 trials, found no difference between women taking aspirin and those who did not with regards to implantation and miscarriage rates but the clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was reported to be significantly higher in the aspirin group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). This study commented on the difference in findings on the clinical pregnancy rate, as compared with the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Gelbaya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelbaya 2007</LINK>), attributing the "divergent findings to different approaches to statistical modelling, study selection, and statistical inference" (<LINK REF="REF-Ruopp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruopp 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this second update of our review, we found two further systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Groeneveld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneveld 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dentali-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dentali 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first group of authors performed an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis; whereas the conventional meta-analysis limited to studies that could provide IPD showed an OR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.2), the conventional meta-analysis limited to the eight studies of which method of randomisation could be confirmed showed an OR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.17) and the conventional meta-analysis including all 10 eligible RCTs identified changed the OR to 1.07 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.41): authors concluded that aspirin does not improve pregnancy rates after IVF.</P>
<P>The second group of authors using pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), included 17 studies with 6403 patients: authors found that the use of aspirin did not improve live birth pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.29), but pregnancy rates were significantly increased in patients randomised to low-dose aspirin (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39), while miscarriage rates were not (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.68); on the contrary, results of sensitivity analyses including high-quality studies did not show statistically significant differences in all considered endpoints. The conclusion reached was that there was not a substantial efficacy of aspirin in women undergoing IVF/ICSI and does not support the use of low-dose aspirin to improve the success of IVF/ICSI in terms of pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-19 10:07:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently there is no evidence to support the routine use of aspirin in order to improve pregnancy rates for a general IVF population. This is based on available data from randomised controlled trials, where there is currently no evidence of an effect of aspirin on women undergoing ART, as there is no single outcome measure which demonstrated a benefit with its use: there is no evidence of a difference in live birth rates associated with use of aspirin compared to placebo or no treatment in women undergoing ART, nor is there evidence of any difference in rates of pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic or vaginal bleeding rates. Furthermore, the possibility of adverse events cannot be excluded as data in the field remain limited.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-19 11:23:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the largest studies included in this review reported on 298 women and showed some benefit in clinical pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="STD-Rubinstein-1997_x002d_1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rubinstein 1997-1999</LINK>). Twenty-eight per cent of the control population obtained a clinical pregnancy compared to 45% using aspirin, giving a 17% improvement. Using these data, an appropriately powered trial would need a similar sample size of 125 women in each group, at a 5% significance level and 80% power and assuming a similar control success rate in order to replicate this improvement. To demonstrate a 10% improvement, a sample size of 350 women in each group would be required.</P>
<P>A major drawback was that only three studies reported on live birth rate, which we consider to be the most important outcome measure.</P>
<P>Since the last update on aspirin for IVF (<LINK REF="REF-Siristatidis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siristatidis 2011</LINK>), no randomised trials have been published in the field. This contradicts current clinical practice, as many women that undergo IVF are treated with low-dose aspirin. Given the fact that, to date, aspirin has not proved to be beneficial, we urge researchers in the field of reproductive medicine to use this review and its outcome parameters to construct well-designed clinical trials that are adequately powered to the outcome measure of live birth rate.</P>
