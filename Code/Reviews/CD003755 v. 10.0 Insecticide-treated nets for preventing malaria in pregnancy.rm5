<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Insecticide-treated nets for preventing malaria in pregnancy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In endemic areas, malaria in pregnancy is a major public health problem. It contributes to severe anaemia in the mother and low birth weight for babies, which are associated with poor infant health and early infant death. Also the unborn child and the pregnant woman may die from malaria in pregnancy. Protection with insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) during pregnancy is widely advocated, but evidence of their benefit has been inconsistent. This review found five trials of ITNs in pregnant women. The four trials in sub-Saharan Africa compared ITNs with no nets and showed a benefit from ITNs in terms of fewer malaria infections, low birthweight babies, and fewer babies died before delivery. The effects on severe anaemia in the mothers were inconclusive. The one trial from Asia compared ITNs with untreated nets and showed a beneficial effect on anaemia in women and fewer babies died before delivery, but it had no impact on other outcomes. ITNs have been shown to be beneficial and should be included in strategies to try to reduce the adverse effects of malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas of the world.</P>

They also reduced low birthweight (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98) and fetal loss in the first to fourth pregnancy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97), but not in women with more than four previous pregnancies. For anaemia and clinical malaria, results tended to favour ITNs, but the effects were not significant. In Thailand, one trial randomizing individuals to ITNs or untreated nets showed a significant reduction in anaemia and fetal loss in all pregnancies but not for clinical malaria or low birthweight.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-11 17:44:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Approximately 50 million pregnant women are exposed to malaria each year. Women are more susceptible to malaria when they become pregnant, placing both the mother and fetus at risk of the adverse consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Brabin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 2001</LINK>). In areas of low and unstable malaria transmission, such as in many regions in Asia and the Americas, women do not acquire substantial antimalarial immunity and are susceptible to episodes of acute and sometimes severe malaria, and fetal and maternal death (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2004</LINK>). In areas with stable malaria transmission, such as in most of sub-Saharan Africa, infection with <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> during pregnancy is characterized by predominantly low-grade, sometimes sub-patent, persistent, or recurrent parasitaemia. These frequently do not result in acute symptoms but cause maternal anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2001a</LINK>) and contribute to low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Brabin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 2001</LINK>), and thus may contribute to early infant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Geertruyden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Geertruyden 2004</LINK>). Because most of these infections remain asymptomatic, and therefore undetected and untreated, prevention of malaria in pregnancy is viewed as being especially important in these settings. </P>
<P>The World Health Organization advocates a three-pronged approach to malaria control in pregnancy that includes the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and antimalarial drugs, either through intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) or case management (treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Another Cochrane Review concluded that the prevention of malaria in pregnancy through chemoprophylaxis or IPT is associated with reductions in placental malaria, low birthweight, severe maternal anaemia, and perinatal mortality in the first two pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2002</LINK>). In areas of stable malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, ITNs are highly effective in reducing childhood mortality and morbidity from malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Lengeler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lengeler 2004</LINK>). Although ITNs are being promoted as a major tool in the fight against malaria in pregnancy, the available evidence about their effect in pregnancy appears inconsistent. In this review, we summarize the available evidence to date from randomized controlled trials of the impact of ITNs on the health of pregnant women and the birth outcome. We do not cover the current debate on the mechanisms of delivering ITNs.</P>

<P>CG, PE, and Feiko ter Kuile (FK) independently assessed the risk of bias in the trials by describing the methods used to generate the allocation sequence and allocation concealment as adequate, inadequate, or unclear according to <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>. We considered blinding by recording whether the participants, investigators, or outcome assessors were aware of the treatment group allocation and recorded the studies description of blinding (open, single, or double) when provided. We considered inclusion of all randomized participants in the analysis as adequate (90% or more of the participants randomized included in the analysis), unclear (not reported), and inadequate (less than 90% participants randomized into the trial included in the analysis).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-14 16:14:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CG entered the data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK>. We anticipated four types of study design:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cluster randomized: villages randomized and nets intended for the whole community.</LI>
<LI>Cluster randomized: villages or antenatal clinics randomized, but only the pregnant women are allocated to nets or no nets.</LI>
<LI>Individually randomized: pregnant women randomized to nets or no nets.</LI>
<LI>Individually randomized: as 3. but pregnant women are a subgroup of all those randomized.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A mass effect related to the area-wide killing of the malaria transmitting mosquitoes is expected to exist with an intervention for the whole community (<LINK REF="REF-Hawley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawley 2003</LINK>), as in 1. Studies that randomized communities (villages or antenatal clinics) need to account for clustering in the analysis. Ignoring the clustering leads to too narrow confidence intervals and small P values, and is likely to produce wrong conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Kerry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerry 1998</LINK>). The decision was made a priori not to combine trials with different comparator groups (no nets or untreated nets).</P>
<P>All cluster randomized trials reported comparative outcome measures with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for clustering, unless otherwise stated. The chosen outcome measure varied between cluster randomized trials. It is not meaningful to combine hazard ratios with odds ratios or risk ratios. In trials that randomize individuals it is possible to convert odds ratios to risk ratios and vice versa if information is available about the probability of the event in each group (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). A similar approach was considered using average event rates across clusters, but this information was not available. Alternatively, odds ratios approximate risk ratios if the event is rare (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). Where event rates were presented with odds ratios, we considered them to approximate risk ratios if the event rate was less than 10%. Where meta-analysis was possible, we combined outcomes using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by inspecting the forest plots, using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity with a 10% level of statistical significance, and using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with a value of 50% representing moderate heterogeneity. We planned to perform subgroup analyses to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity although in most cases there were too few trials to permit this: inclusion of trials randomizing individuals or clusters (herd effect); women of different gravidity; use of co-interventions such as IPT; and differences in transmission intensity due to season and geographical location. In the presence of heterogeneity of trial effects, and where it remained clinically logical to combine trials we used the random-effects model; otherwise we used the fixed-effect model.<BR/>
<BR/>Because parity was considered the greatest potential modifier of the effect of ITNs (with the greatest effect of ITNs anticipated in women with fewer previous pregnancies), we aimed to stratify the analyses by groups according to the number of previous pregnancies (less than three, and three or more) whenever details were provided. One trial included women with no previous pregnancies only and one included no or one previous pregnancy only. Of the three trials that included women regardless of the number of previous pregnancies, <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> reported details of the magnitude of effect by two groups, one for women with in their first pregnancy with those with up to three previous pregnancies and one for women with at least four previous pregnancies. <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> provided subgroups by no, one, and two or more previous pregnancies for all continuous outcome measures (birthweight, haemoglobin, and parasite densities), but not for the dichotomous outcomes. Although <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> provided proportions grouped by the number of previous pregnancies, cluster-adjusted estimates of the precision of effect were only available for the overall effect and not by gravidity groups. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> only included women in their first pregnancy, and <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> included women in their first or second pregnancy. <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> did not provide estimates by the number of previous pregnancies, except for the effect on birthweight.</P>
<P>To consider the effect of ITNs and IPT alone and in combination, we conducted a secondary analysis that excluded those trials that also used IPT (analyses not shown).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Eligibility</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies of ITNs in pregnant women were identified, of which six were randomized controlled trials of ITNs in pregnancy that were potentially eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>). The other was a social marketing study (<LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Setting</HEADING>
<P>The included trials were conducted in Kenya (<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>), northern Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>), and in refugee camps for the Karen people on the Thai-Burmese border (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK>). Malaria transmission rates varied, as described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants and methods</HEADING>
<P>The trials included a total of 6759 pregnant women. Three trials recruited women of all parity groups (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>), one trial recruited women having their first or second baby (<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>), and one trial recruited women having their first baby (<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>). In the cluster randomized trials, <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> included 1961 women (96 clusters), <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> included 2991 pregnant women of all gravidity (79 clusters), and <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> included 503 women (56 clusters). In the individually randomized trials, <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> included 341 women and <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> included 963 women.</P>
<P>The trials distributed the nets at different times: one year before the start of the nested study in pregnant women in <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>; by the start of the trial, January 1997, in <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>; and as they randomized individuals at the time of recruitment in <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK>. As the distribution of nets was completed well in advance of the start of the trials in <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>, women at any stage of their pregnancy who attended the study clinic or hospital were included. <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> included women at any stage of pregnancy but excluded those with an expected delivery date before 12 July 1997 a priori from the analysis to allow sufficient time for the nets to impact on intrauterine growth and gestational age. <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> considered women eligible if the gestational age was estimated to be between 12 and 24 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> recruited women as soon as they attended the antenatal clinic and reported that this was usually at the end of the first trimester.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical management of anaemia and malaria during follow up</HEADING>
<P>The<B> </B>frequency of blood tests to detect parasitaemia and haemoglobin and/or haematocrit levels varied between the trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> provided weekly antenatal care during which blood films were taken for malaria and measured haematocrit levels fortnightly. <I>P. falciparum</I> infections were treated with oral quinine if uncomplicated or with intravenous quinine if severe. <I>P. vivax</I> infections were treated with chloroquine. Women with haematocrit levels below 30% received ferrous sulphate and folic acid until delivery.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>, a blood sample was taken in the third trimester (between 28 and 34 weeks) or at any time that a woman was suspected of being severely anaemic. All women with haemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL received haematinics, and those with parasitaemia were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Women found to be severely anaemic (haemoglobin &lt; 70 g/L) were also given sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> reported that the clinic visits followed the same pattern as routine antenatal care; further details are not provided.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> treated women with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine if they developed an episode of symptomatic malaria during pregnancy. All women received standard care during routine antenatal clinic visits plus routine iron and folic acid supplementation according to antenatal clinic guidelines. Women with haemoglobin levels less than 80.0 g/L were also given treatment doses of ferrous sulphate (6 mg/kg/day) and folic acid (0.5 mg/day) until delivery.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> was conducted in two contigenous areas: a 'non-cohort' area (60 villages) and a 'cohort' area (the remaining 19 villages) where a birth-cohort study was conducted. Birth outcomes were collected in all clusters, but only in the cohort area were women followed monthly throughout pregnancy to determine the incidence of malaria and anaemia. Women with clinical malaria were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Women with haemoglobin levels less than 80 g/L were given ferrous sulphate supplementation and those with levels less than 50 g/L were referred to hospital. Routine antenatal care was available in the noncohort villages.</P>
<P>IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine had not yet been introduced as policy for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in any of the study areas at the time of the trial, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>. This trial provided IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to half of the women as part of the study design, and the other half received placebo IPT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Timing of outcome collection</HEADING>
<P>In determining whether it is reasonable to combine data for particular outcomes the timing of the outcomes also needs to be considered. Malaria and anaemia outcome measures may be determined by blood tests during pregnancy or by blood tests taken at the time of delivery. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> reported haemoglobin and parasitaemia outcomes based on a blood test during the third trimester, while <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> took measurements at the time of delivery. We pooled the results of the peripheral malarial smears and the haematological assessment in the third trimester from <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> with the respective assessments conducted at the time of birth from <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> and reported these in the text only. <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> also took measurements throughout follow up and reported hazard ratios to account for participants lost during the follow-up period and those who were followed up for variable lengths of time. <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> took weekly blood films for malaria and conducted fortnightly tests for haematocrit levels, and reported their incidence during follow up and at the time of delivery.<B> </B>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sample size calculations</HEADING>
<P>The outcome measures used for the sample size calculations varied between the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> powered the study to detect a halving in the prevalence of severe anaemia, an increase in mean haemoglobin of 7.5 g/L, and a 30% reduction in the prevalence of placental anaemia with 80% power and 95% confidence. Full parameters required to replicate the sample size calculations are not provided.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> based the sample size on a 40% reduction in parasite prevalence, which was estimated at 50% in the no nets group. They used 90% power, 95% confidence, and inflated the sample size by 15% for clustering and 10% for losses to follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> powered the study to detect differences based on mean haemoglobin and birthweight. They considered an increase in haemoglobin of 5 g/L (from a 100 g/L mean with a standard deviation of 15 g/L) and an increase in birthweight of 150 g (from a mean of 3000 g standard deviation of 500 g) to signify an important difference. They used 80% power and 95% confidence, and inflated sample size calculations by 25% to allow for losses to follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> was designed to detect a 25% reduction in the prevalence of adverse birth outcomes, defined as low birthweight, preterm birth, or small for gestational age deliveries among women in their first or second pregnancy with 80% power and 95% confidence. This allows for a design effect (clustering) of 1.2 assuming that data would be collected on 80% of the deliveries within 96 hours of birth. The proportion used for adverse birth outcomes in the sample size calculations is not stated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> had 90% power and 95% confidence to detect a change in malaria incidence of 37% in the untreated nets groups to 15% in the treated nets group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All four trials conducted in Africa compared ITNs with no nets (<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>). The remaining trial, conducted in Thailand, compared ITNs with untreated nets (<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK>). All trials used the widely available insecticide permethrin (500 g/m<SUP>2</SUP>), except <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>, which used cyfluthrin.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> randomized individuals to receive either ITNs, untreated nets, or no nets. In the 'no-nets' arm, a large proportion of women received nets from another donor independent to the trial, and the researchers split the results in this control arm into women using donor nets and women not using donor nets. Because this compromised the validity of the control arm, we only present the comparison of ITNs versus untreated nets.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> used a factorial design comparing the effect of ITNs with IPT plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Women were allocated to four groups: nets plus IPT, IPT alone, ITNs alone plus placebo IPT, or placebo IPT alone (case management).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> all provided multiple bed nets to allow use by all members of the households. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> used nets that were 190 cm (width) by 180 cm (length) by 150 cm (height), while <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> provided four different sizes ranging from 100 cm to 190 cm in width. <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> did not provide the size of the nets other than that they were a large family size (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips_x002d_Howard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips-Howard 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> used single-sized nets that were relatively small in size, 70 cm (width) by 180 cm (length) by 150 cm (height). Thus while in both <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> pregnant women were provided with nets as part of antenatal care, only in <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> were they of a sufficient size to allow more than one person to sleep under them.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study subgroups</HEADING>
<P>Three trials presented the results in subgroups. <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> used six subgroups, each divided according to the number of pregnancies (one, two, and three or more) and season (wet or dry). <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> used subgroups based on the use of IPT. <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> used two subgroups based on the number of pregnancies, one to four, and five or more.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-25 10:50:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite over 80 studies of ITNs (reviewed in <LINK REF="REF-Lengeler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lengeler 2004</LINK>), only six were randomized controlled trials that addressed the effect on malaria in pregnancy, half of which were conducted in Kenya. All six trials used the widely available insecticide permethrin (500 g/m<SUP>2</SUP>), except one trial that used cyfluthrin (<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>). The first cluster randomized controlled trial in sub-Saharan Africa was conducted in The Gambia in the early 1990s (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1996</LINK>), but it was excluded from this review for reasons described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>Although the aim was to present meta-analysis results subgrouped by women in their first or second pregnancy and those in their third or greater pregnancy, this was not possible. <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> presented detailed results only by number of pregnancies for continuous outcome measures, and <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> presented results by number of previous pregnancies (none to three, and four or more). The results could be stratified by combining women with none to three previous pregnancies from <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> with the women in their first or second pregnancy in the other trials, and by combining the women in their third or greater pregnancy in the trial from Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK>) with the women in their fifth or greater pregnancy from the trial in western Kenya (<LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>). Despite these limitations, when we combined the results from the four trials in Africa, ITNs were associated with significant reductions in peripheral and placental malaria parasitaemia, low birthweight, and fetal loss. This effect was only evident in the subgroups of women with few previous pregnancies; there was no evidence for a statistically significant beneficial effect in women with at least two or more previous pregnancies.</P>
<P>
<B>Malaria infection: </B>ITNs reduced the frequency of placental malaria and peripheral parasitaemia at the time of delivery. The peripheral parasite densities among infected women were lower in those in their first or second pregnancy, but this was not seen in women with at least two previous pregnancies. There was no significant reduction in the occurrence of self reported or microscopically confirmed episodes of clinical malaria.</P>
<P>
<B>Birthweight and preterm delivery:</B> ITNs were associated with a mean increase of 50 grams (95% CI 20 to 90 grams) in birthweight in women with few previous pregnancies and a 23% reduction in low birthweight. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on low birthweight in women with at least two previous pregnancies or in women protected by IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. No significant decrease in the number of babies delivered prematurely was observed in the single trial that assessed this outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Fetal loss:</B> The risk of fetal loss decreased with the use of ITNs by women in their first or second pregnancy, but again this decrease was not seen in women with at least two previous pregnancies.</P>
<P>
<B>Anaemia:</B> The methodology used to determine and analyse the impact on haemoglobin and anaemia varied considerably between the trials, which limited the ability to combine the results. The overall impact of ITNs on haemoglobin levels or anaemia was inconclusive. There is some support from the two trials in western Kenya that ITNs provide beneficial effects on mean haemoglobin levels in women with few previous pregnancies at the time of delivery. However, no significant beneficial effect on severe anaemia was seen in the other two trials from Africa that assessed haemoglobin in the third trimester, although the effect estimate was in favour of ITNs.</P>
<P>The results from this review are consistent with a non-randomized study of the effect of socially marketed ITNs conducted in an area with intense perennial malaria transmission in southern Tanzania (<LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2002</LINK>), and with the excluded randomized controlled trial by <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1996" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1996</LINK> conducted in The Gambia, which has low and highly seasonal transmission malaria. This supports the current recommendations from the World Health Organization to provide ITNs for pregnant women in all regions with stable malaria transmission throughout sub-Saharan Africa regardless of the degree of malaria transmission intensity.</P>
<P>
<B>Mass effect versus individual barrier protection:</B> ITNs may be implemented as a community control measure, where they are distributed to the whole population, or as personal protection, where pregnant women are specifically targeted to use nets. Four of the five included trials were cluster randomized and used villages as the unit of randomization. The other trial assessed the effect of ITNs when distributed as part of antenatal care and thus randomized individual women. The effect of ITNs in the cluster randomized trials reflects the combined effects of personal protection (individual barrier protection) and area-wide reductions in malaria transmission (community or mass effect). It is possible that the mass killing effect on mosquito populations will have resulted in stronger treatment effects supporting ITNs in the three cluster randomized trials than would be seen in trials randomizing individuals, as women in villages randomized to receive ITNs may have benefited from the area wide reduction of the malaria vector. The KEMRI/CDC ITNs trial conducted in western Kenya suggested that the community effect can be substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Hawley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawley 2003</LINK>). Similar considerations apply to the <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> trial from the Thai-Burmese border. Although this trial randomized individual women rather than communities, all the women lived in the same densely populated refugee camps and some mass-effect by the treated nets cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>Extrapolation of results from cluster randomized trials to predict the impact in programmes that distribute ITNs to individual pregnant women, such as part of antenatal care, or vice versa without taking the effect of coverage into account should be done with care. The three community randomized trials and the two individually randomized trials also differed in the duration of protection during pregnancy. The community randomized trials distributed ITNs to all members of a community regardless of whether they were pregnant, while the individual randomized trials enrolled women when they were, on average, in their second trimester. Most women included in the community randomized trials became pregnant after the intervention was distributed and were as such protected throughout pregnancy, unlike those in individual randomized trials who would be protected only from the second trimester onwards. The risk of peripheral malaria parasitaemia is greatest in the first 20 weeks of gestation, with malaria infection rates at delivery approximating the levels in the postnatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Brabin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brabin 1983</LINK>). The most recent included trial from western Kenya, <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK>, is informative in this respect. This is the only trial that compared the effects of ITNs with no nets using simple randomization by individual allocated through antenatal clinics in an area with low ITN coverage (little or no mass effect). This trial was conducted in an area of western Kenya that was contiguous with the location of <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK>. They shared similar levels of malaria transmission, socioeconomic and educational status, and ethnicity of the population. They were also conducted at the same time period. The effect estimates in the two trials were remarkably similar, suggesting that ITNs may work equally well when provided to individuals as part of antenatal care in the second trimester as when provided to entire communities.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization recommends the use of IPT as well as ITNs for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in areas where malaria is endemic in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_AFRO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/AFRO 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> is also the only trial that simultaneously assessed the effect of ITNs and IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine using a factorial design that allows the comparison of the effects of each single intervention and the combined use of ITNs and IPT. The results suggest that the additional clinical benefits of combined approaches on birthweight and maternal anaemia are small, if any. ITNs provided no additional benefit to women also receiving the two-dose regimen of IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The benefit of ITNs in this group is likely to be restricted to the effects on the infants after birth with continued use of the net by mother and newborn. Additional studies are required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of programmes that use single interventions compared with those that use multipronged approaches to malaria control.</P>
<P>Four of the five trials were conducted in areas of African where malaria is endemic. The only trial conducted in Asia compared ITNs with untreated nets on the Thai-Burmese border. There was a statistically significant reduction in anaemia and fetal loss, but there was no evidence of a beneficial effect on birthweight or gestational age. Further efficacy studies are required before ITNs can be recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Asia and Latin America.</P>
<P>Several limitations should be taken in account when considering the results of the meta-analyses:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>For birth outcomes (haemoglobin, malaria, and birthweight), the results of the cluster-randomized <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> were based on women who delivered in hospital (75 used ITNs and 55 had no nets). As numbers were small the results were not adjusted for clustering and it is plausible that the women who delivered in hospital were different to those who delivered at home, which means they are unlikely to be representative of all those randomized.</LI>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> all women were visited at home at least four weeks (range four weeks to nine months) after their expected date of delivery to ascertain birth outcome in terms of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and maternal deaths. This range means that there maybe variability in the reliability of the data collected.</LI>
<LI>For birth outcomes, the results from <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> are based on 847/1961 (43%) participants in the study due to passive surveillance of birth outcomes.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> randomized individuals whereas the other trials were cluster randomized and may have a herd effect present.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> presented results for women with no to three previous pregnancies, and those with four or more previous pregnancies. The results for the first group were combined with subgroups considering women in their first or second pregnancy, while <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> did not present results grouped by gravidity for the dichotomous outcome measures. This means that stratification by gravidity could not always be presented as desired.</LI>
<LI>Detection and treatment of anaemia and parasitaemia during follow up varied between trials and is likely to have impacted on associated outcome measures. If the intensity of detection and treatment of haemoglobin levels and parasitaemia is greater within the clinical trial than in routine clinical practice, this could potentially reduce the effect of ITNs on these outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 1993</LINK> performed weekly blood tests and <LINK REF="STD-ter-Kuile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ter Kuile 2003</LINK> tested monthly, which would rarely be part of routine antenatal clinic care. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2002</LINK> tested and treated women only if they were suspected of being anaemic or of having malaria, while procedures in <LINK REF="STD-Browne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Browne 2001</LINK> are unclear.</LI>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-03 21:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of ITNs reduces peripheral and placental parasitaemia, increases maternal haemoglobin concentrations, increases mean birthweight, and decreases the risk of fetal loss in the women in their first to fourth pregnancies. The effects were apparent in the community (cluster) randomized trials in which women benefited from protection throughout pregnancy and from area-wide killing of malaria vectors (community effect), and in individual protection studies where ITNs were distributed to individuals as part of antenatal care in the latter half of pregnancy. ITNs should be an integral part of strategies to prevent malaria in pregnant women living in areas of Africa where malaria is endemic.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-03 21:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No further trials of ITNs in pregnancy are required in sub-Saharan Africa and research efforts should focus instead on improving their coverage in pregnant women. Further research is required of the benefits of combining IPT and ITNs in a multipronged approach to prevent malaria in pregnant women. Further research is also required before this recommendation can be extended to Asia and Latin America.</P>

<P>Malaria transmission: endemic and perennial with peaks in the 2 rainy seasons with individuals on average receiving 10 infective bites per person per year (ranging from 1 every 2 years to nearly 60 per person per year)</P>
<P>The trial recruited pregnant women who came from a rural population that had already been randomized to receiving or not receiving nets treated with permethrin (500 g/m<SUP>2</SUP>) as part of a trial assessing the effect of ITNs on childhood mortality and severe malaria in children; randomization and distribution of nets had been finished by August 1993, and this study was conducted between September 1994 and November 1995</P>

<P>Malarial transmission: intense perennial transmission with 60 to 300 infected bites per person annually with peaks in the 3 rainy seasons</P>
<P>Conducted within the context of a large community-based randomized controlled trial designed to assess the impact of ITNs on mortality in children &lt; 5 years of age. The mortality in children trial consisted of two main sites, Asebo and Gem, but the study on the impact of ITNs in pregnancy was conducted in Asebo area only (200 km<SUP>2</SUP>). The trial involved randomizing villages to the intervention group, in which all households received ITNs during the fourth quarter of 1996 or control group which received ITNs in April 1999 after the trial was completed</P>
