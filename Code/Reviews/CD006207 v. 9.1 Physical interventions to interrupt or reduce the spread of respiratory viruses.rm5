<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-03 14:08:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although respiratory viruses usually only cause minor disease, they can cause epidemics. Approximately 10% to 15% of people worldwide contract influenza annually, with attack rates as high as 50% during major epidemics. Global pandemic viral infections have been devastating. In 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected around 8000 people, killed 780 and caused an enormous social and economic crisis. In 2006 a new avian H5N1, and in 2009 a new H1N1 'swine' influenza pandemic threat, caused global anxiety. Single and potentially expensive measures (particularly the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs) may be insufficient to interrupt the spread. Therefore, we searched for evidence for the effectiveness of simple physical barriers (such as handwashing or wearing masks) in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses.</P>
<P>We included 67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a varied set of observations: participant people and observations on participants and countries (the object of some studies). Any total figure would therefore be misleading. Respiratory virus spread can be reduced by hygienic measures (such as handwashing), especially around younger children. Frequent handwashing can also reduce transmission from children to other household members. Implementing barriers to transmission, such as isolation, and hygienic measures (wearing masks, gloves and gowns) can be effective in containing respiratory virus epidemics or in hospital wards. We found no evidence that the more expensive, irritating and uncomfortable N95 respirators were superior to simple surgical masks. It is unclear if adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing with soap is more effective. There is insufficient evidence to support screening at entry ports and social distancing (spatial separation of at least one metre between those infected and those non-infected) as a method to reduce spread during epidemics.</P>

<P>In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 papers of 67 studies.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-03 14:08:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a heterogenous set of observations (participant people, observations on participants and countries (object of some studies)). The risk of bias for five RCTs and most cluster-RCTs was high. Observational studies were of mixed quality. Only case-control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta-analysis. The highest quality cluster-RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case-control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non-inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-25 18:39:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pandemic viral infections pose a serious threat to all nations. There have been several recently, including pandemic influenza (one of which has just occurred) (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>) and a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Shute-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shute 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Even non-epidemic acute respiratory infections (ARIs) place a serious burden on the health of nations. In total these cause much of the 7% of total deaths in the world that are attributed to lower respiratory tract infections (representing four million deaths worldwide, mostly occurring in low-income countries). In addition there is a huge burden from ARIs on morbidity and nations' healthcare systems (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html">www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html</A>).</P>
<P>High viral load and infectiousness probably increase the spread of acute respiratory infection outbreaks (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006207/bibliography.html#CD006207-bbs2-0158">Jefferson 2006a</A>). Stopping the spread of virus from person to person may be effective at preventing these outbreaks. This can be achieved in a number of ways. However, single interventions (such as vaccination or antiviral drugs) may be inadequate (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006207/bibliography.html#CD006207-bbs2-0154">Jefferson 2005a</A>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006207/bibliography.html#CD006207-bbs2-0155">Jefferson 2005b</A>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006207/bibliography.html#CD006207-bbs2-0156">Jefferson 2005c</A>; <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006207/bibliography.html#CD006207-bbs2-0158">Jefferson 2006a</A>).</P>

<P>There is increasing evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2005c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2010</LINK>) that single measures (such as the use of vaccines or antivirals) may be insufficient to interrupt the spread of influenza. However, a recent trial showed that handwashing may be effective in diminishing mortality due to respiratory disease (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>). The possible effectiveness of public health measures during the 'Spanish Flu' pandemic of 1918 to 1919 (<LINK REF="REF-Bootsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bootsma 2007</LINK>) in US cities led us to wonder what evidence exists on the effectiveness of combined public health measures such as isolation, distancing and barriers. We also considered the major social implications for any community adopting them (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Given the potential global importance of interrupting viral transmission, up-to-date, concise estimates of effectiveness are necessary to inform planning and decision-making. We could find no previous systematic review of such evidence.</P>

<P>Epidemics and pandemics are more likely during antigenic shift in the virus (especially influenza), when the viral genes sufficiently alter to create a new subtype against which there is little circulating natural immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>). This may happen when viruses cross from animal species such as ducks or pigs to infect humans (<LINK REF="REF-Bonn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonn 1997</LINK>).

<P>A common problem in these studies was a lack of reporting of viral circulation in the reference population, making interpretation and generalisability of their conclusions questionable.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomised studies</HEADING>
<P>Three RCTs were poorly reported with no description of randomisation sequence, concealment or allocation in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Satomura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Satomura 2005</LINK> reported the generation of randomisation but the very nature of the intervention (gargling with water with or without povidone iodine versus standard gargling with no attempt at masking the taste of iodine) made blinding impossible. The design of two trials was so artificial that their results cannot be generalised to everyday situations (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Satomura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Satomura 2005</LINK>) is linked to a subsequent brief report which provides contradictory information which is difficult to reconcile (<LINK REF="REF-Kitamura-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitamura 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the cluster-randomised trials varied. Only the best reported cluster coefficients and conducted analysis of data by unit of (cluster) allocation instead of by individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandora 2005</LINK>). Analysing cluster-randomised trials at the individual level leads to spuriously narrow confidence intervals around the estimates of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>). Other frequent problems were a lack of description of randomisation procedure, partial reporting of outcomes, unclear numerators or denominators and unexplained attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2001" TYPE="STUDY">White 2001</LINK>), and either complete failure of double-blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988b</LINK>) or inappropriate choice of placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Longini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Longini 1988</LINK>). Three cluster-randomised trials involving the use of face masks (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacIntyre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacIntyre 2009</LINK>) by influenza-like illness (ILI) contacts had poor compliance. This shows the difficulty of conducting clinical trials using bulky equipment in the absence of the perception of a real threat. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2008</LINK>) was also conducted in a period of low viral circulation and randomisation was carried out on the basis of two different sequences. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-MacIntyre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacIntyre 2009</LINK>) was underpowered to detect differences in effect between different types of masks.</P>
<P>The cluster-randomised trial by Sandora and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Sandora-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sandora 2008</LINK>) is at low risk of bias with careful evaluation of compliance in the intervention arm (hand sanitiser wipes and disinfection of surfaces).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-06-03 14:08:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three RCTs were poorly reported with no description of randomisation sequence, concealment or allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>). The design of two trials by one author means their results may not be generalised to everyday situations. This is due to the artefactual delivery of the interventions tested (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK> in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section) (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the cluster-randomised trials varied. Only the highest quality trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandora 2005</LINK>) reported cluster coefficients and conducted analysis of data by unit of (cluster) allocation instead of by individuals. Analysing cluster-randomised trials at the individual level leads to spuriously narrow CIs around the estimates of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>). Other common problems were a lack of description of randomisation procedure, partial reporting of outcomes, unclear numerators or denominators and unexplained attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2004</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-White-2001" TYPE="STUDY">White 2001</LINK>) and either complete failure of double-blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988b</LINK>) or inappropriate choice of placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Longini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Longini 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2009</LINK> is an underpowered individual randomised trial carried out in Japan. Its open design means that due to lack of accounting for drop outs and definitions of outcomes the trial is at high risk of bias. In addition, no guidance as to the generalisability of its results to other settings and countries is provided to readers.  </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aiello-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Aiello 2010a</LINK> is at medium risk of bias. Despite logistical and design problems the trial appears to show an effectiveness gradient of mask-wearing and hand sanitation combined versus instruction on hand sanitation and mask-wearing in student halls. The last cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2010</LINK>) compared the effects of education alone versus education plus the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser versus education plus the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser plus the use of medical face masks on the interruption of self-reported upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza or other viral pathogen by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in US immigrant Latino households. Due to design issues, difficulty interpreting whether there was an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and lack of sufficient details of dropouts and other reporting problems, we classified it at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Loeb-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 2009</LINK> is a low risk of bias non-inferiority trial directly comparing the effects of surgical mask wearing versus N95 fit-tested respirators in nurses in acute units in Ontario Canada. The outcomes measured range from symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza to physician visits and ILI caused by non-influenza agents. This is possibly the most reliable piece of evidence available for this 2010 update.</P>
<P>We classified five of the nine case-control studies as having medium risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2007</LINK>) and two as at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teleman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Teleman 2004</LINK>), mostly because of inconsistencies in the text and lack of adequate description of controls. Two case-control studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>) were at high risk of bias. Their interpretation is not straightforward. Both studies assess the effects of multiple factors as risk and protective measures for SARS during the epidemic in China. They appeared to be searching for associations and lacked precision with respect to conducting true matched blinded assessments.</P>
<P>Only live cases were considered when we know that between 10% to 20% of infected healthcare workers died in the first weeks of the epidemic (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK> mentions the high mortality rate in the Introduction). However, the studies did ascertain the cases and controls of SARS by performing confirmatory laboratory testing rather than relying on a clinical diagnosis. </P>
<P>Six of the 16 prospective cohort studies were classified as at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Agah-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Agah 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dick-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dick 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madge-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Madge 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somogyi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Somogyi 2004</LINK>), four as of medium risk (<LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kimel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>) and three as of high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Master-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Master 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niffenegger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Niffenegger 1997</LINK>). One was a very brief report of a small study (<LINK REF="STD-Derrick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Derrick 2005</LINK>) and two recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Broderick-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Broderick 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007</LINK>) report insufficient details to allow assessment.</P>
<P>Four retrospective cohort studies exploring the effect of barrier interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Doherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaacs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2006</LINK>) and one study reporting on adverse effects of barrier interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 2006</LINK>) had a high risk of bias. The other high risk of bias retrospective cohort study is <LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2010</LINK>, mainly due to the nature of its design, heavily dependent on web availability of information.</P>
<P>Six of the 13 controlled before-after studies were at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclair-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leclair 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macartney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macartney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2006</LINK>), two of medium risk (<LINK REF="STD-Krasinski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krasinski 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>) and five at high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Gala-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gala 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heymann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krilov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Krilov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snydman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common problem in all of these studies was a lack of reporting of viral circulation in the reference population, making interpretation and generalisability of their conclusions questionable.</P>
<P>The results of a GRADE evaluation (the GRADE Working Group available from <A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/index.htm">http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/index.htm</A>) of the case-control studies categorised them as providing low to very low quality evidence and categorised the updated RCTs as very low quality with the exception of two studies which were considered of moderate quality (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved the full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 papers of 67 studies. Four trials were listed in the <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> section. For one trial currently being submitted for publication we had insufficient information for assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Aiello-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Aiello 2010b</LINK>).

Another study was identified after our searches had been conducted (<LINK REF="STD-Raboud-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Raboud 2010</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported results from randomised studies</HEADING>
<P>Three studies tested the effects of hand-cleaning on inactivating the virus and preventing experimental rhinovirus colds. These resulted in either a reduction in the incidence of rhinovirus infection among volunteers treated using different combinations of the acids used for cleaning (P = 0.025) (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>) or did not reach statistical significance (13% versus 30% with combined denominator of only 60) (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>). Using iodine treatment of fingers, one out of 10 volunteers were infected compared to six out of 10 in the placebo preparation arm (P = 0.06 with Fisher's exact test) (<LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 1980</LINK>). One study found that gargling with water or povidone-iodine solution in addition to handwashing is effective in preventing URTIs, but not influenza-like illnesses (<LINK REF="STD-Satomura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Satomura 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three cluster-randomised studies tested the effects of virucidal cleaning disposable handkerchief wipes on the incidence and spread of ARIs. One reported a reduced incidence of ARIs in the household over 26 weeks, from 14% to 5% (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988a</LINK>). A similar study reported a small non-significant (5%) drop across families (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988b</LINK>). However, since the drop in incidence was confined to primary illness, unaffected by tissue use, we might assume they were ineffective. A community trial also reported a non-significant reduction in ARI secondary attack rates (18.7% versus 11.8%) during a time of high circulation of influenza H3N2 and rhinoviruses in the community (<LINK REF="STD-Longini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Longini 1988</LINK>). This result is likely to be an underestimate because of any barrier effect of the inert tissue wipes used in controls.</P>
<P>Eight cluster-randomised studies tested educational programmes to promote handwashing, with or without the adjunct of antiseptic agents, on the incidence of ARIs either in schools or in households. Because of different definitions, comparisons, lack of reporting of cluster coefficients and (in two cases) missing participant data (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1994</LINK>), we judged it improper to meta-analyse the data. Two of these trials reported a lack of effect: RR for the prevention of acute respiratory illness of 0.94 (95% CI -2.43 to 0.66) (<LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1994</LINK>); and 0.97 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.30) (<LINK REF="STD-Sandora-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sandora 2005</LINK>). Nevertheless, the highest quality trials reported a significant decrease in respiratory illness in children up to 24 months (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97), although the decrease was not significant in older children (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2000</LINK>); and a 50% (95% CI -65% to -34%) lower incidence of pneumonia in children aged less than five years of age in a low-income country (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>). Another study reported a decrease of 30% to 38% in respiratory infections with additional hand-rubbing (RR for illness absence incidence 0.69, RR for absence duration 0.71) (<LINK REF="STD-White-2001" TYPE="STUDY">White 2001</LINK>). One study reported decreased school absenteeism of 43% with the additional use of alcohol gel as well as handwashing (<LINK REF="STD-Morton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2004</LINK>). Two trials reported that repeated handwashing significantly reduced the incidence of colds by as much as 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladegaard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ladegaard 1999</LINK>). One study found that in households in which interventions (handwashing with or without wearing a facemask) were implemented<SUP> </SUP>within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, transmission<SUP> </SUP>of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed infection was reduced, an<SUP> </SUP>effect attributable to reductions in infection among participants<SUP> </SUP>using face masks plus hand hygiene (adjusted OR 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.87)) (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of the cluster-randomised trial by Aiello et al (<LINK REF="STD-Aiello-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Aiello 2010a</LINK>) suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic compared to no intervention or hand sanitiser and education. This conclusion is based on a significantly lower level of ILI incidence in the mask and hand sanitiser arm compared to the other two arms after adjustment for covariates (30% to 50% less in arm one compared to controls in the last two weeks of the study). However, influenza virus circulation was very low during the study period.</P>
<P>The authors of <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Jacobs-2009">Jacobs 2009</A> were unable to detect a difference in incidence of ILI of surgical mask wearing compared to no mask in healthcare workers in a Japanese hospital, possibly because of the study's lack of power.</P>
<P>The cluster-randomised trial by Larson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2010</LINK>) tested the addition of mask and hand sanitiser use to hand sanitiser use alone to nothing other than education which was common to all three arms. Given the many biases in the design and reporting the results are difficult to interpret: the hand sanitiser group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (P = 0.01) but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the hand sanitiser group (P = 0.0001).</P>
<P>The credible results of the individual trial by Loeb et al (<LINK REF="STD-Loeb-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 2009</LINK>) report that the use of surgical masks was not inferior to the use of N95 respirators against influenza.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported results from case-control studies</HEADING>
<P>Nine case-control studies assessed the impact of public health measures to curb the spread of the SARS epidemic during February to June 2003 in China, Singapore and Vietnam. Homogeneity of case definition, agent, settings and outcomes allowed meta-analysis. We pooled binary data; one of the comparisons showed significant heterogeneity (handwashing), however we used a fixed-effect model. A random-effects model made no appreciable difference to the handwashing comparison. Although continuous data were often available, the variables were different and measured in different units with standard deviations usually missing, which prevented their meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Studies reported that disinfection of living quarters was highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.39) (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004a</LINK>); handwashing for a minimum of 11 times daily prevented many cases (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), based on seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teleman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Teleman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>); simple mask-wearing was highly effective (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.39) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), based on seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>); three studies found N95 respirator-wearing even more effective (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), (<LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teleman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Teleman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>); glove-wearing was effective (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teleman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Teleman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>); gown-wearing was also effective (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teleman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Teleman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>); all means combined (handwashing, masks, gloves and gowns) achieved very high effectiveness (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.35) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Nishiura-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nishiura 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seto 2003</LINK>); use of eye protection such as goggles or masks with goggles is protective (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Chen-2009">Chen 2009</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Liu-2009">Liu 2009</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Yin-2004">Yin 2004</A>) and nose-washing was also protective (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.57) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Chen-2009">Chen 2009</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=0FE24C5782E26AA200397CEA97BFC10A&amp;versionPK1=62540188944746881994100117215823&amp;versionPK2=13469464477414532559110216025352#STD-Liu-2009">Liu 2009</A>).

<P>These data suggest that wearing a surgical mask or a N95 mask is the measure with the most consistent and comprehensive supportive evidence. Seven out of eight studies included masks as a measure in their study and six out of seven of these studies found masks to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis. Handwashing was also included in seven of the studies with four studies showing handwashing to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis. All other measures were shown to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis on only one or two occasions.</P>
<P>Another case-control study from Hong Kong and Guangzhou hospital wards reported that a minimum distance between beds of less than one metre was a risk factor for transmission (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2007</LINK>). Disaggregated data were not reported and therefore we did not pool this study in the meta-analysis.

<P>Using an alcohol rub in students' communal residences resulted in significantly fewer symptoms (reductions of 14.8% to 39.9 %) and lower absenteeism (40% reduction) (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>). In a much-cited small experimental study, virucidal paper handkerchiefs containing citric acid interrupted the transmission of rhinovirus colds transmitted through playing cards: 42% of re-usable cotton handkerchief users developed colds compared with none using disposable virucidal tissues (<LINK REF="STD-Dick-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dick 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few identified studies reported interventions in the daycare setting, either in staff or patients. One staff educational programme on handwashing in a daycare centre for adults was effective over a four-year period in reducing rates of respiratory infection in daycare patients from 14.5 to 10.4 per 100 person-months to 5.7 (P &lt; 0.001), with an accompanying decline in viral isolates. This seems to be more effective than the use of additional portable virucidal hand foam as an adjunct to handwashing (<LINK REF="STD-Falsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falsey 1999</LINK>). This confirmed an earlier report of the effectiveness of a handwashing programme in reducing absenteeism for ILI in a primary school (<LINK REF="STD-Kimel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kimel 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two high risk of bias studies reported that education, a handwashing routine and encouragement for kindergarten children, parents and staff in correct sneezing and coughing procedure were effective, although there were considerable fluctuations in incidence of infections in the control and test centres (<LINK REF="STD-Niffenegger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Niffenegger 1997</LINK>); but the intervention was not effective in reducing absenteeism caused by ARIs (RR 0.79, P = 0.756) (<LINK REF="STD-Master-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Master 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dyer and colleagues reported a prospective, cluster, open-label, cross-over cohort study. The study assessed the effectiveness of a hand sanitiser in conjunction with at will soap-and-water handwashing in a private elementary school in California. Use of the sanitiser reduced illness absenteeism by 41.9% (reduction in respiratory illnesses of 49.7% over the 10-week period of the study) (<LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Curiously, an infection-control education programme reinforcing handwashing and other hygienic measures in a nosocomial setting reported reducing the number of organisms present on hands and surfaces, and ARIs, although the data tabled suggested the opposite (an incidence rate of 4.15/1000 patient-days in the test homes versus 3.15/1000 in the control homes) (<LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study found wearing a goggle-mask apparatus in healthcare workers visiting and caring for children aged up to five with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and symptoms of respiratory disease was effective (5% illness rate in goggle wearers against 61% in no-goggle controls) (<LINK REF="STD-Agah-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Agah 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rapid laboratory diagnosis, cohort nursing and the wearing of gowns and gloves for all contacts with RSV-infected children significantly reduced the risk of nosocomial RSV infection (OR 0.013 to 0.76) (<LINK REF="STD-Madge-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Madge 1992</LINK>), although another similar study reported no effect of adding the use of both gown and mask to the usual handwashing routine on the development of illness in personnel caring for infants with respiratory disease (4 out of 30 in the handwashing group alone compared to 5 out of 28 in the handwashing, gown and masking group, P &gt; 0.20); although the authors described poor compliance with the barrier protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Strict procedures of triage and infection control to stop transmission of SARS from infected children to carers and visitors of a large hospital at the height of the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong was reported effective at interrupting the transmission of SARS, as no healthcare worker became ill, in contrast to experiences in other institutions (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A tiny study comparing the N95 respirator with paper surgical masks in volunteers found that surgical masks, even when worn in multiple layers (up to five), filtered ambient particles poorly (<LINK REF="STD-Derrick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Derrick 2005</LINK>); this principle was confirmed in another small study of air filtration to prevent droplet spread (<LINK REF="STD-Somogyi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Somogyi 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported results from retrospective cohort studies</HEADING>
<P>Two studies investigated isolating together children less than three years of age with suspected RSV. In one, transmission was diminished by "up to 60%" (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacs 1991</LINK>), while the statement that nosocomial transmission "was minimised" was not supported by data in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Doherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doherty 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Isolation of cases during the 2003 epidemic of SARS in China was reported to limit transmission only to those contacts who actually had home or hospital contact with a symptomatic SARS patient (attack rate 31.1%, 95% CI 20.2 to 44.4 for carers; 8.9%, 95% CI 2.9 to 22.1 for visitors; 4.6%, 95% CI 2.3 to 8.9 for those living with a SARS case) but not to contacts living in the same building, working with cases, or without contact with SARS cases during the incubation period. This suggests extending quarantine only for contacts of symptomatic SARS cases (<LINK REF="STD-Ou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ou 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another brief report carried out in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, in a military hospital in Taiwan, China and 86 control hospitals, compared an integrated infection-control policy to protect healthcare workers against infection; only two from the military hospital were infected with SARS compared to 43 suspected and 50 probable cases in the control hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2006</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2010</LINK> reports a marginal (one to two weeks) non-significant benefit in delaying spread of novel A/H1N1 autochthonous pandemic influenza by various means of entry screening. The high risk of bias is mainly due to the nature of its design, heavily dependent on web availability of information. However, it is difficult to see how else a similar study could have been conducted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported results from controlled before and after studies</HEADING>
<P>Two small studies by the same first author assessed means of nosocomial transmission of RSV in small children and the effects of introducing distancing and barriers: one with low risk of bias reported effective physical distancing and room separation (0 infected out of 14 who sat away from RSV-infected infants compared with five out of seven who cuddled and four out of 10 who touched infected infants) (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1981a</LINK>). The second with high risk of bias reported no incremental benefits of gowns and masks (32% infection versus 41%) (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1981b</LINK>). Adding disposable plastic eye-nose goggles to other respiratory infection-control procedures (isolating infected from uninfected people, handwashing) also reduced transmission of RSV (6% versus 42% of controls) (<LINK REF="STD-Gala-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gala 1986</LINK>). Screening and subsequent isolation of infected from uninfected people ('cohorting') also reduced nosocomial RSV transmission in older children (from 5.33 infections per 1000/patient days of care to 1.23 infections per 1000/patient days after introduction of screening) (<LINK REF="STD-Krasinski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krasinski 1990</LINK>). A similar study reported that increased compliance with a policy of glove and gown isolation precautions reduced the high rate of nosocomial RSV transmission on an infant and toddler ward (RR for pre- and post-intervention periods infection rates 2.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.7) (<LINK REF="STD-Leclair-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leclair 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study of protective gowning did not protect neonatal intensive care unit infants from RSV or any other type of infection, or affect mortality (1.21 per 100 patient-days of gowning compared to 1.38 of none), although selection bias was likely with 17% of participating children lost to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Pelke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pelke 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A German study conducted over three seasons reported a decrease of nosocomial RSV infections, from 1.67/1000 patient-days in the first season to 0.18/1000 patient-days in the last season, after instituting enhanced surveillance and feedback, rapid diagnosis, barriers and isolation, and disinfection of surfaces (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2006</LINK>). A similar study but with high risk of bias reported a decrease from eight confirmed RSV cases per 1000 patient-days to none (<LINK REF="STD-Snydman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 1988</LINK>). A better conducted study over eight years implemented a combination of education with high index of suspicion for case-finding (contact precautions), with barriers (but no goggles or masks) and handwashing for patients and staff reduced RSV infections in a hospital in Philadelphia, USA: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.69 (<LINK REF="STD-Macartney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Macartney 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One small study with serious potential biases assessed training and a sanitary programme (handwashing, disinfection of school buses, appliances and toys) in a special-needs daycare facility for children with Downs Syndrome, a pupil to staff ratio of five or six to one, and reported reductions in: respiratory illnesses from a mean of 0.67 to 0.42 per child per month (P &lt; 0.07); physician visits from 0.50 to 0.33 (P &lt; 0.05); mean courses of antibiotics prescribed from 0.33 to 0.28 (P &lt; 0.05); and days of school missed because of respiratory infections from 0.75 to 0.40 (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Krilov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Krilov 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A very large study of military recruits reported that a structured top-down programme of handwashing at least five times daily nearly halved the incidence of ARIs. Recruits who handwashed less frequently reported more episodes of ARIs (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8), which represents a difference of 4.7 versus 3.2 mean infections per recruit per year, and more hospitalisations (OR 10.9, 95% CI 2.7 to 46.2). However, implementation was difficult (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>An ecological study analysed the effects of quarantine and port of entry screening on the SARS epidemic in early 2003 in Beijing, China, from data collected centrally. Hospitals were the initial sources of transmission of the SARS virus. The shape of the epidemic suggests these measures may have reduced SARS transmission although only 12 cases identified out of over 13 million people screened puts in doubt the direct effectiveness of entry port checks at airports and railway stations, and screening was probably more important (<LINK REF="STD-Pang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>An Israeli study of 186,094 children aged six to 12 years reported that school closure was temporally associated with a 42% decreased morbidity from respiratory tract infections, a consequent 28% decrease in visits to physicians and to emergency departments, and a 35% reduction in purchase of medications (<LINK REF="STD-Heymann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality issues</HEADING>
<P>Several features need consideration before drawing generalisations from these studies.</P>
<P>The settings of the studies, conducted over four decades, were heterogeneous and ranged from suburban schools (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heymann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niffenegger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Niffenegger 1997</LINK>) to military barracks (<LINK REF="STD-Ryan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 2001</LINK>), emergency departments, intensive care units and paediatric wards (<LINK REF="STD-Gala-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gala 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leclair-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leclair 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loeb-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 2009</LINK>) in high-income countries; slums in low-income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>); an upper Manhattan immigrant Latino neighbourhood (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2010</LINK>) and special-needs daycare centres with a very high teacher to pupil ratio (<LINK REF="STD-Krilov-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Krilov 1996</LINK>). Few attempts were made to obtain socio-economic diversity by (for example) involving more schools in the evaluations of the same programme (<LINK REF="STD-Dyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dyer 2000</LINK>). We were able to identify few studies from low-income countries where the vast majority of the burden lies, and where cheap interventions are so critical. Even in high-income countries, such as Israel, the dramatic fall in ARIs subsequent to school closure may have been related to that country's high child population (34%). Additionally, limited availability of over-the-counter medications and national universal comprehensive health insurance provided with consequent physician prescription of symptomatic treatment may further limit generalisability of findings (<LINK REF="STD-Heymann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The variable quality of the methods of these studies is striking. Hasty design of interventions for public health crises, particularly the SARS case-control studies, is understandable but less so when no randomisation - not even of clusters - was carried out in several unhurried cohort and before and after studies. Randomisation could often have involved minimal disruption to service delivery. Inadequate reporting especially made interpretation difficult of before-after studies. Incomplete or no reporting of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>), blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988a</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988b</LINK>), numerators and denominators (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kotch 1994</LINK>), interventions, outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>), participant attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>), confidence intervals (CIs) (<LINK REF="STD-Madge-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Madge 1992</LINK>) and cluster coefficients in the relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carabin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carabin 1999</LINK>) led to a considerable loss of information. Potential biases (such as cash incentives given to participants (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>)) were not discussed. Some trial authors even confused cohort with before-after designs to elaborate conclusions unsupported by their data (<LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>). Methodological quality was sometimes eroded by the need to deliver behavioural interventions in the midst of service delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Niffenegger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Niffenegger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nonetheless, even when suboptimal designs were selected, trial authors rarely attempted to articulate potential confounders. A commonly ignored confounder, specific to this area, is the huge variability in viral incidence (<LINK REF="STD-Heymann-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heymann 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaacs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacs 1991</LINK>). Sometimes this was addressed in the study design (<LINK REF="STD-Falsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Falsey 1999</LINK>), even in controlled before and after studies (one attempted correlation between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) admissions and RSV circulating in the community) (<LINK REF="STD-Krasinski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krasinski 1990</LINK>). Another attempted linking exposure (measured as nasal excretion) and infection rate in the pre- and post-intervention periods (<LINK REF="STD-Leclair-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leclair 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inappropriate placebos caused design problems. In some studies the placebo probably carried sufficient intervention effect apparently to dilute the intervention effects (<LINK REF="STD-Longini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Longini 1988</LINK>). Two valiant attempts probably failed because placebo handkerchiefs were impregnated with a dummy compound which stung the users' nostrils (<LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farr-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Farr 1988b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies used impractical interventions. Volunteers subjected to the intervention hand cleaner (organic acids) were not allowed to use their hands between cleaning and virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the intervention remains unknown (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004a</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2004b</LINK>). Two per cent aqueous iodine painted on the hands, although a successful antiviral intervention, causes unacceptable cosmetic staining, impractical for all but those at the highest risk of epidemic contagion (<LINK REF="STD-Gwaltney-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Gwaltney 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compliance with interventions, especially educational programmes, was a problem for several studies despite the importance of many such low-cost interventions. Overall the logistics of carrying out trials in immigrant neighbourhoods or students' halls of residence are demanding and recognition should be given to all those who planned and carried out studies in very difficult circumstances (as in the middle of an epidemic).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The evidence</HEADING>
<P>The highest quality cluster-randomised trials indicate most effect on preventing respiratory virus spread from hygienic measures in younger children. Perhaps this is because younger children are least capable of hygienic behaviour themselves (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2000</LINK>), and have longer-lived infections and greater social contact, thereby acting as portals of infection into the household (<LINK REF="REF-Monto-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monto 1969</LINK>). Additional benefit from reduced transmission from them to other members of the household is broadly supported by the results of other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater.</P>
<P>The pooled case-control studies, which focused on the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain respiratory virus epidemics. We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of devices such as the N95 respirator over simple surgical masks. This evidence is supported by a high quality hospital-based trial (<LINK REF="STD-Loeb-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Loeb 2009</LINK>) which reports non-inferiority between face barriers. Overall masks were the best performing intervention across populations, settings and threats. More expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, N95 respirators may be useful in very high-risk situations but additional studies are required to define these situations.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether the incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing actually decreased the respiratory disease burden outside the confines of the rather atypical studies, upon which we reported. The extra benefit may have been, at least in part, accrued by confounding additional routines.</P>
<P>Studies preventing transmission of RSV and similar viruses appeared to be closer to real life and suggest good effectiveness. However, methodological quality concerns of the controlled before and after studies, mentioned previously, suggest benefits may have been due to population differences, especially virus infection rates. These were poorly reported in most studies.</P>
<P>Routine long-term implementation of some of the measures assessed in this review would be problematic, particularly maintaining strict hygiene and barrier routines for long periods of time. This would probably only be feasible in highly motivated environments, such as hospitals, without a real threat of a looming epidemic. Most of the trial authors commented on the major logistic burden that barrier routines imposed at the community level. However, the threat of a looming epidemic may provide stimulus for their inception.</P>
<P>A disappointing finding was the lack of proper evaluation of global and highly resource-intensive measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing. The handful of studies (mostly conducted during the SARS epidemic) do not allow us to reach any firm conclusions. It is remarkable that despite a long lead time to the declaration of a pandemic, an international, prospective study to evaluate entry screening practices was not set up. The study by Cowling et al is a good contribution to our evidence base but no substitute for a well designed and conducted trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2010</LINK>). Finally, few studies reported harms from the interventions studied. Harms affect compliance, which may decrease even if the intervention is merely cumbersome (such as a mask) and the threat is unclear.</P>

<P>Through the World Health Organization (WHO), we made inquiries to identify a list of manufacturers of the interventions assessed in this review. However, no such list appears to exist. The low-tech (i.e. locally manufacturable) nature of some of the interventions, the lack of effective regulation in some settings and the possible endless number of manufacturers make the compilation and updating of such a list in a satisfactory manner very difficult. As a consequence it is impossible to gauge the existence of unpublished data. Low-tech device marketing is poorly regulated and incompletely understood.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-13 21:12:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Public health measures can be highly effective, especially when they are part of a structured programme that includes instruction and education and when they are delivered together. There is a clear requirement to carry out further large, pragmatic trials to evaluate the best combinations in the community and in healthcare settings and with other respiratory viruses. RCTs with a pragmatic design, similar to the Luby et al trial, should be carried out whenever possible (<LINK REF="STD-Luby-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luby 2005</LINK>). Nevertheless, this systematic review of the available research does provide some important insights. Perhaps the impressive effect of the hygienic measures aimed at younger children derives from the children's poor capability with their own hygiene. The variable quality and small scale of some studies is known from descriptive studies (<LINK REF="REF-Aiello-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiello 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>) and systematic reviews of selected interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Meadows-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meadows 2004</LINK>). More research is needed to evaluate the most effective strategies to implement successful physical interventions in practice, both on a small scale and at a population level. More attention should be paid to describing and quantifying the harms of the interventions assessed in this review and their relationship with compliance.</P>

<P>Cluster-randomised trial assessing the effects of hand sanitiser and masks with masks or no intervention on ILI symptoms. The trial was conducted in University halls of residence with more than 100 student residents in a US university during the 2006 to 2007 influenza &#8220;season&#8221;. It lasted 6 weeks</P>
<P>The units of randomisation were 7 of the 15 halls. One hall was very large (1240 residents) and the 6 remaining ones which had between 110 and 830 residents were combined into 2 clusters roughly equivalent in size. The 3 clusters were then randomised by random extraction of the clustered halls&#8217; names out of a container.

<P>Willing, consenting residents aged 18 or more. Recruitment of students began in November 26 but the trial did not go &#8220;live&#8221; with distribution of intervention materials until 22 January 2007 when the first case of influenza was confirmed on campus by laboratory tests. Enrolment continued until 16 February 2007 and the study was completed on 16 March 2007. During the study period there was a 1-week break when the majority of residents left campus. There were 1327 eligible participants, of which 1297 had a complete baseline survey and at least 1 weekly survey result (367, 378 and 552 in the mask and hand sanitiser, mask only and control groups respectively, giving a total of 1297). It is unclear what the ineligibility criteria were for the 30 missing (1327 minus 1297) but the explanation may be in the appendix.</P>

<P>Laboratory details are described in appendix </P>
<P>Effectiveness: ILI, defined as cough and at least 1 constitutional symptom (fever/feverishness, chills, headache, myalgia). ILI cases were given contact nurses phone numbers to record the illness and paid USD 25 to provide a throat swab. 368 participants had ILI and 94 of these had a throat swab analysed by PCR. 10 of these were positive for influenza (7 for A and 3 for B), respectively by arm 2, 5 and 3 using PCR, 7 using cell culture </P>
<P>Safety: n/a</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2011-05-16 18:06:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors conclude that &#8220;These findings suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic&#8221;. This conclusion is based on a significantly lower level of ILI incidence in the mask and hand sanitiser arm compared to the other 2 arms after adjustment for covariates (30% to 50% less in arm 1 compared to controls in the last 2 weeks of the study) </P>
<P>Comparison with the ILI rate of the control arm may not be a reflection of the underlying rate of ILI because the intervention arm received instruction on hand sanitation and hand etiquette </P>
<P>The play of adjustments is unclear. The intra cluster correlation coefficient is reported in the footer of Table 4. Its very small size suggests lack of clustering within halls</P>
<P>The role of the spring break is mentioned in the Discussion as are the results of this study compared to other studies included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Cowling-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cowling 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacIntyre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">MacIntyre 2009</LINK>)</P>
<P>The authors report that 147 of 1297 participants (11.3%) &#8220;at baseline&#8221; had ILI symptoms and were excluded from analysis. During the 6 weeks of the study 368 of 1150 participants (32%) had ILI. This averages out at about 5% per week. It is unclear what the term &#8220;at baseline&#8221; means. Presumably this means during the 2 to 3 weeks of participant enrolment. If this is so, the reason for the triggering of the interventions (tied to influenza isolation) are obscure as the trial is supposedly about ILI and an ILI outbreak was already underway &#8220;at baseline&#8221;</P>

<P>The institutional review board of the Naval Health Research Centre classified the protocol of this study as a non-research public health endeavour. Given the flaws of the study design (the disparity between the number of closed and open units, testing 2 different &#8216;aetiological&#8217; hypothesis using different methodologies and lack of information on how the units were selected), one gets the impression that this study was probably carried out at least retrospectively instead of being carried out as a prospective study as claimed by the authors. The authors conclude that social distancing did not reduce FRI and that environmental contamination rather than person to person transmission is the culprit in the spread of FRI. The method used for social distancing, however, did not exclude those that were little bit sick but did not require placement in the MCU. In other words, sick people were allowed to remain in the closed unit (? as well as in the open units); only apparently healthy recruits were allowed to rejoin the open units after being placed in the MCU and PCU<BR/>
<BR/>The study put emphasis on the importance of environmental cleaning. In addition to that crowded areas increase the risk of transmission of viruses. In the study, however, it was not clear if open and closed units are similar or different as pathogen reservoir. Also, analysis of closed units according to the population size was not done and information about the location of the closed units (all over the centre or localised in certain (isolated) area) is lacking. Despite these clear limitations this pragmatic study's findings may be interpreted in a variety of different ways. Perhaps the most interesting interpretation is that environmental conditions are determinants of adenoviral infectivity but not entry and exit from a community. In other words virological and presumably bacterial agents persist in the environment, they are not &#8220;brought&#8221; in and do not &#8220;arrive&#8221; and do not directly and invariably cause one-on-one disease. This hypothesis challenges the current simplistic interpretation of the postulates of Henle-Koch (one agent = one disease and suggests that the presence of microorganism may only be one of the many variables which determine infectious disease. This interpretation is comforted by the relatively small number of isolates found in studies of ILI causes (so called pie studies)</P>
<P>The corresponding author provided the following additional information:<BR/>each week a new cohort of about 500 recruits arrives at the camp, all of whom arrive by Wednesday. On Thursday the recruits are assigned to 6 platoons (each platoon housed in its own large room - called "housing units" in the article). Each cohort's 6 housing units are numbered from 1 to 6, with no particular distinction between them. Each house is given approximately the same number of recruits. The placement of the recruits into the housing units is based somewhat on the order of their arrival to the camp, but otherwise there are no criteria for placement, although relatives and friends are allowed to be in the same platoon. The recruits at MCRD San Diego tend to be from west of the Mississippi. There is no particular order of arrival at the camp from different regions. The number of the closed housing unit assigned in each cohort varied. In the majority of cases it was 1 or 2<BR/>
<BR/>Each building contains 4 wings of 3 floors each. From the sky, the buildings form an H shape. The line in the middle of the H connects the sides of the H, and on each side the half above the middle line is one wing and below the middle line is the other wing. If you go on <A HREF="http://maps.google.com">maps.google.com</A> and type in 'san diego ca mcrd' and zoom in on C you can see how big the buildings are. The housing units for each cohort typically occupy 2 wings one building, but occasionally one housing unit will be in a different building. E.g. if there are 6 housing units in a cohort, the cohort will occupy 3 floors of wing A and 3 floors of wing C. The map gives you an idea of the geography of horizontal distance between each wing, and each floor is about 10 feet high. Although the housing units are relatively close to each other, the platoons do not typically interact with each other. They are large permanent buildings each consisting of 12 large rooms and a hallway</P>

<P>The authors conclude that &#8220;Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimising or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals&#8221;. </P>
<P>The study is biased by the selection of cases and controls (enrolment only of available personnel) and the non-eligibility (and lack of mention) of HCW who died of SARS (which may be up to 20% of people who were ill during the first wave of SARS). The design and analysis are very similar to those of <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2004</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK> and the design also lacks focus. i.e. it does not test a defined hypothesis, but trawls through large numbers of variables looking for associations. There is no attempt at matching cases with controls and part of the design is prospective (IgG estimation). As a consequence the design distinction between a case-control and a cohort study is blurred. There is no mention of whether interviewers were blinded to case or control status of interviewees </P>
<P>Data extracted are from the univariate analysis table 3 which is the table reporting both numerators and denominators for cases and controls. Table 4 (multivariate logistic analysis) reports the significant multiple protective associations: caring for super spreading patient and avoiding face to face contact while caring for SARS patient (OR 0.30, 0.15 to 0.60) and wearing gloves coupled with methods of ventilation (various ORs for the various combinations intensity of wearing and ventilation methods, all significant). In the light of so many biases it is difficult to interpret the data but there does seem to be a gradient favouring multiple interventions</P>

<P>Retrospective cohort study carried out in North Staffordshire hospital (UK) during 2 periods: from 1 November 1994 to 31 January 1995 and from 1 November 1995 to 31 January 1996. The study assessed the use at admission of assigning children to a cohort once a rapid enzyme immunoassay or immunofluorescence testing had identified RSV-positive patients. The incidence of RSV illness was compared in cohorted and uncohorted children. The authors believed that this procedure would aid clinical management and minimise cross-infection from affected to susceptible patients. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from infants and young children with an acute respiratory illness. Aspirates were sent for rapid diagnostic testing. RSV-positive patients were cohorted into 6-bedded bays on the paediatric ward. All carers observed standard routines (handwashing and gown wearing)</P>

<P>Prospective, cluster open-label cross-over cohort study of programmed use of a hand sanitiser in conjunction with at-will soap-and-water handwashing conducted in a private elementary school in California. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the SAB sanitiser at reducing illness absenteeism in a school setting. Subjects were grouped by classroom without formal randomisation. 7 classes received the instant sanitiser, while the remaining 7 classes were assigned to the control group. Male-to-female ratios and age distributions of the 2 groups did not differ significantly<BR/>Prior to study commencement all students participated in an educational programme about germs and the importance of handwashing to prevent illnesses. Children in the hand sanitiser group received a spray to use under teacher supervision to supplement normal, at-will handwashing with soap and water. The control group was instructed to wash hands with water and soap, and it was not supervised. Data were collected for 10 weeks. After this period, there was a 2-week wash-out period, during which neither group of students used SAB sanitiser. Then SAB sanitiser was distributed to the student group that had previously served as the control and the study proceeded for another 4 weeks<BR/>

<P>Risk of bias: low<BR/>Notes: the authors conclude that the educational programme for staff was associated with an almost 50% decrease in the infection rate in daycare attendees. The programme was effective only in the last of the 4 years of the programme (rates of infection in daycare patients fell from 14.5 to 10.4 per 100 person-months to 5.7 per 100 person months, P &lt; 0.001). This is a conclusion based on an ecological study of the incidence of ILI in 3 previous seasons which the authors report in the same paper, but which does not report numerators and denominators and was not extracted. The lower infection rate is likely to reflect the combination of interventions and education, which increased staff awareness and more broadly changed behaviour. There was no apparent additional benefit from the virucidal foam. This is one of the few identified studies reporting circulating viruses in the daycare setting, both in staff and patients. The decline in influenza-like illness episodes across the 4 study years is reflected in the decline in viral isolates, suggesting that aspecific measures such as handwashing are effective against the main respiratory viruses</P>

The questionnaire results suggest that some bias may have been present since a majority of mothers in the virucide group believed they were receiving the "active" tissues.

Other harms were reported by very small numbers of users (4 or below).

After 4 weeks the wearing of gowns and masks was discontinued and handwashing alone was used for the final 5 weeks of the study. Throughout the study handwashing, cohorting and isolation were employed and emphasised. The number of nosocomial infections in patients and staff for period 1 were compared with the period 2 (last 4 weeks of the study). Infections that occurred in the interval week were not counted</P>

<P>Risk of bias: high<BR/>Notes: the authors concluded that the use of masks and gowns as additional infection-control procedures for RSV infection shows no appreciable benefit in preventing nosocomial spread of RSV to infants or to the ward personnel. The nosocomial infection rate in the 2 periods was not significantly different in either the infants or staff (32% infection versus 41%). Both of the study periods appeared to be equal in terms of potential for transmission or exposure to RSV. The number of infants admitted during both periods was similar. Furthermore these 2 groups of contacts were alike in age and types of underlying diseases. The routine use of masks and gowns does not seem warranted in view of the considerable cost. A very poorly reported study with an unclear eligibility procedure and a lack of description of denominators. Why not use randomisation?</P>

<P>Risk of bias: high<BR/>Notes: the authors concluded that school closure was temporally associated with 42% decreased morbidity from respiratory tract infections, a consequent 28% decrease in visits to physicians and to emergency departments and a 35% reduction in purchase of medications. Limits of this study are: the fact that in Israel 33.8% of the population are children, hence these results may not be applicable to high-income countries with lower percentage of children. In addition there may be a difference in parental attitudes toward respiratory illness symptoms in other cultures that affect health care utilisation. Another reason for such a difference may be the basic structure of the health system in Israel, where comprehensive health insurance is universal and provided by the law. Finally there is limited availability of over-the-counter medications, and to obtain symptomatic therapeutic agents children are generally seen by a physician. The biggest limit to this study is not mentioned by the authors: the assumption that the circulation of respiratory viruses is constant throughout the study period. Although in the Discussion the authors mention some surveillance data on national diffusion of an H3N2 epidemic but this took place in December 1999</P>

<P>Retrospective and prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of cohorting and educational programme (handwashing) in reducing the incidence of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infections<BR/>Data on all children with RSV infection on any of the paediatric wards in winter of 1986 to 1987 were retrospectively collected. In order to define the population at risk of developing RSV infection it was determined the number of children under 2 years of age hospitalised on the 2 paediatric wards and the paediatric intensive care unit and the number they spent in hospital. For the next 2 winters (1987 to 1988 and 1988 to 1989) the same data were prospectively collected. In addition some interventions were made to try to reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired RSV infection. Children admitted with suspected RSV infection were nursed in a specific area until the result of an indirect immunofluorescent test. It was not possible to cohort babies on the paediatric intensive care unit. Staff were instructed on the importance of handwashing and this was reinforced on ward rounds. An educational leaflet was prepared and given to the parents of every child admitted with the infection<BR/>

<P>Risk of bias: high (poor descriptions)<BR/>Notes: the authors concluded that handwashing and cohorting reduced at least 66% in the number of hospital acquired infections due to RSV in the 2 intervention winters. One minor problem with cohorting was that babies could not remain in the accident and emergency department until a diagnosis of RSV was virologically confirmed. Hence they were cohorted on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The authors also underline the importance of a more rapid antigen test for RSV. It is doubtful whether the non-exposed cohort is similar to its hospital peers, especially because there are several cardiac children in the exposed cohort. The biggest limit to this study is mentioned by the authors in the Discussion: the assumption that the circulation of RSV is constant throughout the study period. Exposure however is not the same in the 3 seasons and observed effect may be due to cohorting or to the different viral circulation</P>

Teachers were surveyed to determine classroom handwashing activities. The influenza season usually occurs during December and January. The handwashing programme was planned for presentation just prior to this time. The effectiveness of the programme was determined by comparing absentee rates among participants and non-participating classes (the control group).

<P>Laboratory: PCR carried out on samples from deep nasal swabs for influenza and the most common other pathogens (RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses etc.). The text describing the results of the swabbing is confusing but in general appears to be non-random &#8220;Households reported 669 episodes of ILI (0 to 5 per individual)". Of the 234 deep nasal swabs obtained, 33.3% (n = 78) tested positive for influenza; 43.6% (n = 34) were influenza A and 56.4% (n = 44) were influenza B. Among the 66.7% who tested negative for influenza, 30.8% (48/156) tested positive for other viruses: 7 for respiratory syncytial virus, 9 for parainfluenza, 11 for enterovirus, 10 for rhinovirus, 6 for adenovirus, and 5 for metapneumovirus. Swabs were not obtained from the remaining 435 reported ILI episodes for the following reasons: 72.0% (n = 313) did not meet the CDC definition of an ILI and were therefore included in the URTI symptom count, 21.4% of episodes (n = 93) were reported after 48 hours of ILI onset or the participant refused to be swabbed, and the research staff were unable to reach the participant in 6.7% of episodes (n = 29)</P>

<P>The authors conclude that &#8220;the Hand Sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (P,0.01), but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the Hand Sanitizer group (P,0.0001). The proportion of households that reported &gt;50% of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study (P,0.001). Despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor, mask wearing as well as increased crowding, lower education levels of caretakers, and index cases 0&#8211;5 years of age (compared with adults) were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates (all P,0.02). In this population, there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitiser or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of URTIs, but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations. During the study period, community concern about methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> was occurring, perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitiser in the Education control group, and diluting the intervention&#8217;s measurable impact&#8221;. </P>
<P>The study is at high risk of bias. Randomisation and reasons for dropout are not described. Differentials in cluster characteristics across arms point to randomisation not having worked and the confounding effects of a post-randomisation staphylococcal scare is difficult to judge. Symptom-driven follow up gives no idea of the effects on asymptomatic ILI/influenza. Poor definitions (URTI?). There are unexplained dropouts and the analysis plan is unclear. Finally the very small number of cases of influenza and an unclear swabbing attrition may introduce further elements of confounding</P>

<P>Controlled before and after study conducted in children's hospital of Boston, USA, to determine whether increased compliance with a policy of glove and gown isolation precautions could reduce the high rate of nosocomial RSV infection on an infant and toddler ward. All patients admitted to the 28-bed infant and toddler medical ward during 3 consecutive RSV seasons (1982 to 1985) were included in the study. When patients with known or suspected RSV infection were admitted, an attempt was made to place them in single rooms or to group them together, but infected patients were frequently required to share rooms with susceptible patients during the winter months, when the prevalence of RSV on the wards is highest. The RSV season was defined as the 24 weeks each year starting at the beginning of November and continuing through the end of April. All the documented cases of RSV infection occurred during that period, and all the patients and patient-days during that interval on the study ward were recorded. RSV infections were classified as nosocomial if symptoms developed 5 or more days after the patient's admission to the hospital. All cases of RSV infection were confirmed virologically. During the first half of the study nursing staff wore both gloves and gowns for only 20 of 52 observed contacts. During and after the second compliance survey, compliance rapidly increased: nursing staff wore both gloves and gowns for 73 of 90 of their contacts</P>

<P>Risk of bias: low<BR/>Notes: the authors concluded that the incidence of nosocomial RSV infection rose with the intensity of hospital exposure and that this rise was markedly different in the periods before and after intervention. The use of gloves and gowns can reduce the nosocomial transmission of RSV, particularly with increasing exposure to patients shedding the virus (RR for pre and post-intervention periods infection rates 2.9, 1.5 to 5.7). Compliance by the staff improved dramatically after the intervention and it continued even after the end of the study, probably because the favourable results of the intervention were well-publicised, the head nurse introduced an educational programme emphasising the appropriate application of isolation precautions, and gowns and gloves became more accessible to care givers. The study, although prone to selection bias, is better designed than some of it peers as there is an attempt at adjusting for different levels of RSV circulation by sub-analysis by virus shedding days by the infected participants</P>

The trial trigger was the beginning of the influenza season defined as isolation of 2 or more viruses in a district in the same week. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak all Ontario nurses caring for febrile patients (38 °C or more and new onset cough or SOB) had to wear surgical masks. The randomisation (carried out in blocks of 4 by centre) then consisted of either confirmation to same-maker surgical mask wear or N95 respirator wear. Investigators and laboratory staff were blind to allocation status, but for obvious reasons (the visible difference in interventions), participants were unblinded. &#8220;The criterion for non-inferiority was met if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the reduction in incidence (N95 respirator minus surgical group) was greater than -9%&#8221;.

Interestingly non-inferiority seemed to be applicable both to seasonal viruses and nH1N1 viruses (as 8% and 11.9% were serologically positive to nH1N1). This finding is explained either by seeding or cross reaction with seasonal H1N1. Equivalent conclusions could be drawn for nurses with complete follow up.

This a well-designed, well-written study despite the unexplained attrition of 5 families, the lack of reporting of cluster coefficients and the differential in tissue use between the 2 arms which raises questions about the robustness of double-blinding. Particularly notable is the discussion on the low generalisability of results from the study from the placebo arm given that even the inert barrier of the tissues is a likely to have limited spread.

<P>The authors conclude that adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk for ILI-associated infection, but &lt; 50% of participants wore masks most of the time.

Compliance was by self-report &#8211; therefore likely to be an underestimate<BR/>The primary outcome was ILI or lab-positive illness. This showed no effect<BR/>Sensitivity analysis by adherence showed that under the assumption that the incubation period is equal to 1 day (the most probable value for the 2 most common viruses isolated, influenza (21) and rhinovirus (26)), adherent use of P2 or surgical masks significantly reduces the risk for ILI infection, with a hazard ratio equal to 0.26 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.77; P = 0.015). No other covariate was significant. Under the less likely assumption that the incubation period is equal to 2 days, the quantified effect of complying with P2 or surgical mask use remains strong, although borderline significant; hazard ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.98; P = 0.046). The study was underpowered to determine if there was a difference in efficacy between P2 and surgical masks (Table 5). The study conclusion appears to be a post-hoc data exploration. Regardless of this the study message is that respirator use in a family setting is unlikely to be effective as compliance is difficult unless there is a situation of real impending risk</P>

<P>Controlled before and after study conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Kapiolani medical centre, Honolulu, Hawaii, to assess the effect of gowning on RSV and other infections, on traffic and handwashing patterns. Alternate 2-month gowning and no-gowning cycles were established in a 24-bed NICU for 8 months. One entire 4-month cycle was repeated to eliminate the potential for seasonal variables and outbreaks. All the people entering into the NICU (physicians, nursing staff, ward clerks, families and visitors) wore gowns. During the no-gowning periods nursing staff wore hospital-issued pantsuit, washed at home through ordinary methods and worn from home. Ward clerks, physicians, hospital staff, families and visitors wore street clothes without gowns. Throughout the entire 8-month period, there was the recommendation for all staff and visitors to enforce initial 2-minute hand-scrub. Nails were cleaned before scrubbing, and a minimum 15-second handwash between infants or equipment was expected. Surveillance cultures were done weekly on all patients. Without the knowledge of the NICU staff, a neonatal research nurse scheduled observations of traffic patterns, while ostensibly reviewing charts, to determine if a lack of gowning procedures encourage more traffic. Handwashing compliance was studied, again without staff awareness, by 30 minutes direct observation. Follow up of infection rates was planned through standard infection control surveillance</P>

Gowning procedures did not deter staff or visitors from entering the unit, since traffic was also unchanged between periods. Finally the results showed no change in handwashing patterns between periods. Besides the advantage of eliminating a potentially unnecessary ritual that may be perceived as a psychological barrier to families visiting their infants, other benefits to discontinuing gowning include saving staff time involved in various gowning procedures and costs. If gowns are eliminated, it is recommended to perform careful follow up. The study conclusions must be taken with caution given the likely selection bias introduced by the missing 17% of children</P>

The study is good quality with low risk of bias. The authors checked compliance by counting discarded wipes.

The authors measured the norovirus concentration on surfaces and found this reduced.

These preparations provided effective residual antiviral activity on the hands. The virucidal effect of these hand treatments resulted in a reduction in the incidence of rhinovirus infection in the treated volunteers (P = 0.025). The utility of this observation in the natural setting remains to be determined. The volunteers were not allowed to use their hands in the interval between the hand treatment and the virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the virucidal activity of these organic acids is not known. Similarly, the virus challenge method used in these experiments may not simulate the natural setting in all aspects. The effect of nasal secretions that would be transferred with the virus in the natural setting on the activity of the acids or on the transmission of virus was not tested in the model<BR/>We are unsure as to the practical significance of this study and the generalisability of its results to the real world.

<P>The authors conclude that the integrated infection control strategy appeared to be effective in reducing the incidence of HCWs contracting SARS. Point estimates? 95% CIs. The advantages included rapid implementation without negative pressure isolation rooms, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-enforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing. The efficacy and low cost are major advantages, especially in countries with large populations at risk and fewer economic resources<BR/>

<P>Case-control study to analyse the risk factors associated with nosocomial outbreaks of SARS in hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China. The study was designed with the individual hospital wards as the units for data collection and analysis. Case wards were hospital wards in which super spreading events of SARS occurred, and control wards were hospital wards in which patient(s) with SARS were admitted, but no super spreading events occurred. A super spreading event is defined as the development of &#8805; 3 new cases of SARS in a ward during the period from 2 to 10 days after the admission of an identifiable index patient or as the development of a cluster of &#8805; 3 new cases of SARS in a ward during a period of 8 days but without any known sources of SARS<BR/>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>There is no information on the causes of ILI other than the reporting on the 10 influenza PCR-positive swabs of 94 out of 368 students with ILI. This is a very low rate (and the Discussion confirms that the influenza season was mild) but investigation of the other known causes of ILI is not even mentioned in the text. This is especially important because stress, alcohol intake levels and influenza vaccination were a significant predictor of ILI symptoms (Table 1). The reason for selective testing and/or reporting of influenza viruses tests over the other causes of ILI are unclear especially as the study objective was focused on ILI. The text also is difficult to follow, weaving the reporting of ILI and influenza without a clear rationale</P>
