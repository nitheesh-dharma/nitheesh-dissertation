<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Obesity is closely related to type 2 diabetes and weight reduction is an important part of the care delivered to obese persons with diabetes. This review of drugs for weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes revealed weight loss of between 2.0 and 5.1 kg for fluoxetine, orlistat and sibutramine at follow-up of up to 57 weeks. The long-term effects remain uncertain. Adverse events were common in all three drugs: gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat; tremor, somnolence, and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine. There were few studies examining other drugs used for weight loss in populations with diabetes. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-02 16:00:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Computerized searches were performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and other electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of reference lists and selected journals.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, controlled trials were included where pharmacotherapy was used as the primary strategy for weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes. Published and unpublished literature in any language and with any study design was included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers abstracted data and the quality of included studies was evaluated by assessing potential attrition, as well as selection and measurement bias, and a Jadad score was obtained. Effects were combined using a random effects model. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 13:21:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A sufficient number of studies were available for a quantitative synthesis for fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine. Twenty two randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxitine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. Pharmacotherapy produced modest reductions in weight for fluoxetine (5.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 - 6.9) at 24 to 26 weeks follow up; orlistat 2.0 kg (CI, 1.3 - 2.8) at 12 to 57 weeks follow-up, and sibutramine 5.1 kg (CI, 3.2 - 7.0) at 12 to 52 weeks follow-up. Glycated hemoglobin also modestly and significantly reduced for fluoxetine and orlistat. Gastrointestinal side effects were common with orlistat; tremor, somnolence and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine. Some studies, using a variety of study designs, were available on other drugs and a significant decrease in weight was noted in three studies of mazindol, one of phenmetrazine, two of phentermine. No studies were identified that fit inclusion criteria for pseudoephedrine, ephedra, sertraline, yohimbine, amphetamine or its derivatives, bupropion, topiramate, benzocaine, threachlorocitric acid, sertraline, and bromocriptine.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine can achieve statistically significant weight loss over 12 to 57 weeks. The magnitude of weight loss is modest, however, and the long-term health benefits remain unclear. The safety of sibutramine is uncertain. There is a paucity of data on other drugs for weight loss or control in persons with type 2 diabetes.</P>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this defect is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e., elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases over time. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane Library (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups-CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>The prevalence of both obesity and diabetes continues to increase. Obesity rates have risen threefold since 1980 in North America, parts of Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, Australasia, and China. More than one billion adults worldwide are overweight (body mass index (BMI (kg/m²) &#8805; 25); at least 300 million of them are obese (BMI &#8805; 30) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In the developed world, recent survey data (<LINK REF="REF-Flegal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flegal 2002</LINK>) indicate that 65% of American adults are overweight and 31% obese (BM I&#8805; 30) (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). The prevalence of diabetes is also rising, with worldwide prevalence estimated at 4.0% in 1995, but expected to rise to 5.4% by 2025 (<LINK REF="REF-King-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1998</LINK>). An estimated 135 million adults had diabetes in 1995, a number expected to rise to 300 million by 2025; this represents increases of 42% in developed countries and 170% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-King-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1998</LINK>). In the United States, the prevalence of diabetes increased 49% from 1990 to 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-DHHS-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. DHHS 2002b</LINK>). Of U.S. adults over age 20, 8.6% have diabetes, of whom one-third are undiagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-DHHS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. DHHS 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both obesity and weight gain are major risk factors for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pi_x002d_Sunyer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pi-Sunyer 1993</LINK>) and every 1-kg increase in weight (self-reported) is associated with a 9% relative increase in the prevalence of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Mokdad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokdad 2000</LINK>). Eighty to ninety percent of persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>) and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes, particularly hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Weight loss is one cornerstone of diabetes care for overweight persons, as it improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Pi_x002d_Sunyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pi-Sunyer 2000</LINK>), and moderate, intentional weight loss is associated with reduced mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>). Among persons with diabetes, weight loss improves lipid profiles by decreasing triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and weight loss improves blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>), mental health, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1991</LINK>). These benefits are clinically meaningful only if weight loss is sustained over time, however (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>). The findings of a reduced incidence of hypertension and diabetes in populations with impaired glucose tolerance or obesity that maintained weight loss over extended periods provide indirect evidence of this benefit (<LINK REF="REF-DPP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HT-Trials-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">HT Trials 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dietary and behavioral treatment for weight loss can produce an average loss of 8% of initial body weight over 3 to 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>), but it is difficult to define effective weight control measures for the long term in general populations (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 1998</LINK>). The majority of obese patients regain most of the weight initially lost in successful interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 1989</LINK>).<BR/>Studies suggest that persons with diabetes lose less weight than persons without diabetes and regain their weight more rapidly, although the mechanisms responsible are unclear and the validity of this observation has not been systematically examined (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>). Obese or overweight persons with diabetes may face additional barriers than non-diabetic persons trying to achieve weight loss. The use of insulin to achieve glycemic control may produce weight gain. The complex treatment regimens for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia all complicate behavioral change aimed at weight reduction. In addition, Wing has noted that obese persons with diabetes who present for treatment are older and sicker than persons without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Obesity may be viewed as a chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1985</LINK>); Greenway (<LINK REF="REF-Greenway-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenway 1999</LINK>) suggests that obesity should therefore be treated as such and that optimal management may require long-term pharmacotherapy. In patients who have failed behavioral therapy, adjunct treatment with drugs may help them reduce or maintain their weight while improving other parameters of health, including glycemic control and lipid profiles. Numerous anti-obesity agents have been used for weight loss in general populations as well as in persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Yanovski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanovski 2002</LINK>). These drugs act through a variety of mechanisms, including centrally acting appetite suppression (e.g., sibutramine and phentermine), increased energy expenditure (e.g., ephedrine and caffeine), and nutrient partitioning via decreased food absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., orlistat). Anti-obesity drugs may be available over-the-counter or by prescription. Some drugs with other specific clinical indications are associated with weight loss (e.g., metformin), and many drugs are used for weight loss although they are not approved for that indication (i.e., off-label usage, e.g., fluoxetine).</P>
<P>Because obese and overweight adults with type 2 diabetes benefit from weight loss but may have more difficulty losing weight than persons without diabetes, we need to define the scope of our knowledge about the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for losing weight or preventing weight gain in these populations. We must determine which, if any, drugs are effective in obese and overweight persons, particularly in the long term, and we must define the nature and incidence of side effects. In addition, we must define areas of uncertainty where further research is needed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:34:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We have identified four recent reviews of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes. Scheen and Lefebvre (<LINK REF="REF-Scheen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheen 2000</LINK>) and Scheen and Ernest (<LINK REF="REF-Scheen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheen 2002</LINK>) discussed the effects of anti-obesity drugs on weight loss, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk profile for obese persons with type 2 diabetes. <LINK REF="REF-Greenway-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenway 1999</LINK> reviewed the use of a broad range of anti-obesity agents among persons with diabetes. <LINK REF="REF-Hauner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauner 1999</LINK> discussed both the impact of antidiabetic agents on weight and the effect of weight management drugs on glycemic control in obese diabetic patients.</P>
<P>None of these articles was a systematic review, involved quantitative syntheses, or assessed the quality of individual studies. In addition, none examined a broad range of outcomes, such as morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Thus, to date we have not located any quality systematic reviews on the efficacy of drugs for weight loss or weight maintenance in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes.</P>

<P>Randomized controlled trials only were included in the review of efficacy as these minimize the potential effects of bias on our results. All study designs, however, were included in the review of adverse events: those with a contemporaneous comparison group (randomized controlled trial, non-randomized trial, or observational study with a concurrent comparison group), or a pre-versus-post design, a cross-sectional design, case-control studies, or a case series. We recognize the potential for bias from confounding and secular trends in studies without randomization, but because observational studies yield important information on adverse events related to treatment, particularly on rare, long-term side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2002</LINK>), we searched for, and synthesized in narrative form, the available observational data on side effects. In our protocol we indicated that we would include additional comparative study designs if we had found an insufficient number of randomized, controlled trials. Since we identified a sufficient number of randomized trials, we only included this study design in the review for efficacy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of follow-up and timing of outcomes measurement</HEADING>
<P>We included studies of any duration and length of follow-up. We defined follow-up from the time of randomization (or for studies without randomization, from the time of entrance into the study) until the last outcomes measurement. We recognize that long-term outcomes are of paramount importance, but examination of the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in the short term also has value. For example, if weight loss can be demonstrated with drugs in the short term, pharmacotherapy may be combined with behavioral interventions for long-term weight control. In addition, an exploration of the relationships between the population and intervention characteristics and the efficacy of these drugs in the short-term may provide insights into how to achieve longer-term success.</P>

<P>Internal validity was assessed by two reviewers for each study. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the component assessment method of Cochrane was used (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) as well as the Jadad score (<LINK REF="REF-Jaded-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaded 1998</LINK>). For the former method, the following quality criteria were assessed as "met" or "unmet":<BR/>1. Minimisation of selection bias: a) Was the randomization procedure adequate? b) Was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>2. Minimisation of performance bias: Were the participants and those administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>3. Minimisation of attrition bias: a) Were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) Was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>4. Minimisation of detection bias: Were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>The risk of bias was assessed as low (A) (all criteria were met), moderate (B) (one or more criteria were only partly met), or high (C) (one or more criteria were not met).</P>
<P>For studies that were not RCTs, the comparability of groups at baseline and attrition were noted. Studies were not excluded because of poor quality; where data were sufficient the effect of potentially biasing factors on outcomes was examined.</P>

Heterogeneity between trial results was tested using a standard chi-square test (<LINK REF="REF-Cochran-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochran 1954</LINK>) with a significance level of alpha = 0.1 in view of the low power of such tests.

<P>Where data from RCTs were thought to be sufficiently homogeneous with respect to interventions and outcomes, we calculated pooled effect sizes. For continuous variables reported on the same scale we calculated weighted mean differences. The absolute differences in outcome between each follow-up and the baseline measure for the intervention and comparison study group (&#916;I and &#916;C) were calculated and inserted in Review Manager Software (Review Manager 4.2). When the estimate of variance of (&#916;I) and (&#916;C) was not given, it was calculated from the outcome measures in each study group using the formula Vpre+ Vpost - 2r(SDpre*SDpost), where Vpre is the variance of the mean baseline outcome, Vpost is the variance of the mean follow-up outcome, r is the correlation between the baseline and follow-up values, and SDpre and SDpost are the standard deviations of the baseline and follow-up groups, respectively. Since most studies do not report r, and its true value is unknown, data are presented with r = 0.75, and a sensitivity analysis was performed as described below.<B>

<P>Characteristics of the 22 eligible RCTs examining fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine are shown in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>
<B> </B>and <LINK REF="APP-12" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 12</LINK>. These studies included 296 participants who received fluoxetine, 2036 orlistat, and 1047, sibutramine. Follow-up intervals ranged from 8 to 52 weeks for fluoxetine, 12 to 57 weeks for orlistat, and 12 to 52 weeks for sibutramine. Most studies used a run-in period lasting 1-5 weeks, where a placebo was given and dietary counselling started. Generally the duration of drug treatment was the same as the follow-up interval, although in three studies weight change was recorded from the beginning of the run-in period (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanefeld-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanefeld 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgarde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgarde 2000</LINK>). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1992</LINK>) examined weight maintenance after discontinuation of the study drug. Study participants' mean age was between 48 and 66 years across studies and somewhat more than half were female. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions from the funnel plots.</P>
<P>Mean weight of the control group at baseline was 95 kg (SD 18.5 kg) for fluoxetine, 95.9 kg (11.1 kg) for orlistat, and 97 kg (17.3 kg) for sibutramine. BMI was presented in only 14 of the studies (range 31 to 37). Participants generally had poor glycemic control by current treatment standards (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>). Most studies excluded patients who were taking insulin, although two studies examined insulin-using subjects exclusively (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kelley 2002</LINK>). Drug dosages were very consistent among studies, except for one study of sibutramine that used a twice-daily dosage regime (<LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>). All studies examined continuous therapy. All except one study of fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kane-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kane 1994</LINK>) involved a dietary intervention for both the treatment and control groups, and the comparison groups all received a placebo. Average contacts ranged from 2 to 18, an average of 1.1 per month. Attrition during the run-in period ranged from 1.5% to 22% in the studies where it was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgarde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgarde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanefeld-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanefeld 2002</LINK>) In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hanefeld-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hanefeld 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daubresse-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daubresse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daubresse-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daubresse 1996</LINK>) participants were randomized only if they had high rates of compliance for visits or pill consumption during the run-in period.</P>

Weight loss ranged from 10.5 kg for sibutramine at 26 weeks follow-up (95% CI, 7.6 - 13.4) (<LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>) to 1.4 kg for fluoxitine at 8 weeks of follow-up (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6) (<LINK REF="STD-Kutnowski-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kutnowski 1992</LINK>). The pooled effects were the following: orlistat over all follow-up periods demonstrated a loss of 2.0 kg (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8); sibutramine over all follow-up periods produced a loss of 5.1 kg (95% CI, 3.2 to 7.0); loss for fluoxitine at 8 to 16 weeks was 3.4 kg (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.2), 24 to 26 weeks was 5.1 kg (95% CI, 3.3 to 6.9), and one study examining fluoxetine at 52 weeks produced a loss of 5.8 kg (95% CI, 0.8 to 10.8).</P>
<P>Reduction of GHb ranged from 2.2% for sibutramine at 26 weeks follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>) to 0.1% for three studies of sibutramine at follow-up intervals of 24 and 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fujioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujioka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serrano_x002d_Rios-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serrano-Rios 2002</LINK>). Gokcel and colleagues used a dose of sibutramine of 10 mg twice daily, unlike other studies which used 15 or 20 mg in a single daily dose. One study published only as an abstract utilized up to 30 mg as a single daily dosage (<LINK REF="STD-Vargas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vargas 1994</LINK>). The pooled reduction for GHb was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3 to 0.6) for orlistat (follow-up between 24 and 57 weeks); sibutramine 0.5% (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.3) (follow-up 12 to 52 weeks); fluoxetine 1.0% (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.5) at 8 to 16 weeks, 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.4) at 24-26 weeks, and one study with a follow-up of 52 weeks demonstrated a reduction of 1.8% (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.8) (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kane-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kane 1994</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>We identified 22 studies published only as abstracts for fluoxitine (four total, all RCTs), orlistat (14 total, 9 RCTs), and sibutramine (four total, three RCTs) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria: six for fluoxetine, 20 for orlistat, and seven for sibutramine. Pooled effects obtained by combining abstracts of RCTs and full-text RCTs did not produce significant changes in the direction or significance of results of the full-text studies only.</P>
<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis making two different assumptions about the behavior of intervention group dropouts. After excluding studies that used last outcome carried forward data-reporting techniques, we had three sibutramine, two orlistat, and five fluoxetine studies remaining. We therefore performed the sensitivity analysis only for fluoxetine. When we assumed that none of the dropouts had a weight change, the pooled reduction in weight was 3.0 kg (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.6), and when we assumed that dropouts had weight changes equivalent to those of the control group, the pooled reduction was virtually identical 3.0 kg (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.6). These estimates did not differ a great deal from the pooled estimate of 4.0 kg (95% CI, 2.0 - 5.9) for the five studies eligible for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kane-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zelissen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zelissen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daubresse-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Daubresse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using the between-group change for each study, we performed a meta-regression to investigate potential interactions of weight loss with study-level variables, including follow-up interval, number of contacts between care provider and participant, and percentage attrition in the intervention group. None of the interactions was significant.</P>
<P>Because all but one study involved a dietary intervention combined with the drug or placebo, we could not investigate whether the addition of a lifestyle or behavioral intervention added to the efficacy of a drug. Nor did we have enough studies in different strata to examine the relationship between patient characteristics (e.g., age, race, baseline weight, GHb) and change in weight.</P>
<P>We attempted to explore the relationship between the score for risk of bias and change in weight, but we did not have enough studies to stratify into categories (A, B and C) for each drug. We examined the relationship between risk of bias and weight change in a regression model, however, and found no significant interaction.</P>
<P>We did not have sufficient data to perform subgroup analyses for weight, age, sex, diabetes treatment, race / ethnicity, or duration of treatment. In particular, we were not able to examine the effect of metformin or acarbose on weight loss, as only two full-text studies reported participants using metformin (<LINK REF="STD-Fujioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujioka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>), and none using acarbose.</P>
<P>Since we had statistical heterogeneity for our pooled estimates of weight change ,we present the random effects model in our summary pooled effects. Both fixed and random effects models are presented in <LINK REF="APP-21" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 21</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-22" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 22</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-23" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 23</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-24" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 24</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-25" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 25</LINK>, and <LINK REF="APP-26" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 26</LINK>. These tables also contain the pooled effects using different values of the correlation between pre- and post- measures (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0); in no case was there a significant change in the results compared to using a value of 0.75.</P>
<P>Sibutramine studies showed significant heterogeneity for both weight (Chi-squared test for heterogeneity, P &lt; 0.0001) and GHb (p &lt; 0.0001). The study by Gokcel and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>) utilized twice daily dosing for sibutramine and had more marked improvements in both weight and GHb. The pooled effect excluding this study was a reduction in weight of 4.3 kg (95% CI 2.7 to 6.0) and in GHb of 0.2% (95% CI 0.4 to 0.04). Heterogeneity remained significant for weight (p &lt; 0.0001), but was no longer significant for GHb (p = 0.84)</P>
<P>There were few data available for fluoxetine on other outcomes (<LINK REF="APP-15" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 15</LINK>). Orlistat was associated with statistically significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides, that were sustained at 52 weeks follow-up. Several studies examined the effects of sibutramine on blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fujioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujioka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serrano_x002d_Rios-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serrano-Rios 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Redmon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaukua-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kaukua 2004</LINK>) and lipids (<LINK REF="STD-Fujioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujioka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gokcel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gokcel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Serrano_x002d_Rios-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serrano-Rios 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaukua-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kaukua 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Redmon 2003</LINK>), and a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 0.8 mm Hg, 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.65) and in triglycerides (0.3 mmol/L (95% CI 0.04 to 0.50)).</P>
<P>Adverse events for fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine are summarized in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. Adverse events were common in all three drugs, both in the intervention and control groups. Rates of gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat were about 20 percentage points higher in the treatment groups than in control groups. Tremor, somnolence, and sweating were common with fluoxetine, and palpitations with sibutramine. We included a study by Bach and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Bach-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bach 1999</LINK>) which did not fulfil our inclusion criteria as no weight outcomes were presented, but the study examined cardiac value dysfunction among persons with diabetes using sibutramine, and we felt it was important to include this study in our narrative presentation of adverse events.</P>

<P>There were studies in the literature examining the efficacy of five other drugs for weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes: cimetidine, diethylproprion, mazindol, phenmetrazine, and phentermine (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-10" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-11" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 11</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-13" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 13</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-14" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 14</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-16" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 16</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-18" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 18</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-19" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 19</LINK>). There were insufficient data on these drugs for quantitative syntheses, therefore the results will be described in a narrative fashion.</P>
<P>One study examined the efficacy of cimetidine for weight loss in a double blind RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Stoa_x002d_Birketvedt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stoa-Birketvedt 1998</LINK>) with 12 weeks of treatment. They noted a nonsignificant decrease in weight of 3.7 kg associated with a small improvement in glycemic control. Side effects included diarrhoea (10%), and one patient each with arthralgia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. No other literature was located on cimetidine that fit our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bratusch_x002d_Marrian1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bratusch-Marrian1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1968</LINK>) and two pre versus post design studies (<LINK REF="STD-Montenero-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Montenero 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendon-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hendon 1962</LINK>) examined the efficacy of diethylpropion for weight loss. These were mostly older studies with sample size between 40 and 58 and follow-up from 8 to 40 weeks. Weight change was the only outcome examined in these studies, and 2 RCTs demonstrated significant weight loss of 1.6 kg (95% CI 0.2 to 3.0) (<LINK REF="STD-Bratusch_x002d_Marrian1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bratusch-Marrian1979</LINK>), 8.8 kg (95% CI 6.9 to 10.7) (<LINK REF="STD-Hendon-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hendon 1962</LINK>). In a pre versus post design study, Montenero and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Montenero-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Montenero 1964</LINK>) demonstrated a loss of 5.3 kg (95% CI 4.1 to 6.4). Side effects were noted in two studies: dry mouth (13%) (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstone-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstone 1966</LINK>) and headache and nausea (rate not given) (<LINK REF="STD-Hendon-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hendon 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mazindol was examined in three full-text RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bandisode-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Bandisode 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crommelin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Crommelin 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slama-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Slama 1978</LINK>), and one abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Boshell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Boshell 1974</LINK>), as well as one study of uncertain design (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1976</LINK>), one pre versus post design study (<LINK REF="STD-Dolecek-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dolecek 1976</LINK>), and one cohort study with a comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-Felt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Felt 1977</LINK>). These are all studies from the 1970's, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 64, and follow-up between 6 and 12 weeks. Significant weight loss was noted in three studies: Sanders and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1976</LINK>) 3.3 kg (95% CI 2.5 to 4.1), Slama et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Slama-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Slama 1978</LINK>) 12.5 kg (95% CI 5.5 to 19.5), and Boshell et al. 1.9 kg (<LINK REF="STD-Boshell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Boshell 1974</LINK>) (95% CI 3.1 to 0.8). Three other studies also demonstrated favorable changes in weight (<LINK REF="STD-Dolecek-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dolecek 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bandisode-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Bandisode 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crommelin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Crommelin 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Felt 1977</LINK>). None of these studies noted significant changes in fasting blood sugar. Constipation was not infrequent (<LINK REF="STD-Felt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Felt 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolecek-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dolecek 1976</LINK>); other side effects included dry mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Crommelin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Crommelin 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolecek-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dolecek 1976</LINK>), nervousness or the sensation of stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Dolecek-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dolecek 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bandisode-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Bandisode 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1976</LINK>), and headache (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Felt 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bandisode-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Bandisode 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phenmetrazine was only examined in one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Buckle-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Buckle 1966</LINK>) which compared participants taking phenmetrazine hydrochloride to those taking a combination of phenmetrazine theoclate and phenbutrazate hydrochloride. This was a cross-over study, and the results were presented for both groups combined. A significant decrease in weight was noted (2.9 kg (95% CI 2.3 to 3.6)) and no other outcomes were measured. Side effects included dizziness (20%), abdominal discomfort and nausea (15%), and dry mouth (5%).</P>
<P>Two studies examined phentermine (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gershberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gershberg 1977</LINK>). It was unclear whether an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Gershberg-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Gershberg 1972</LINK>) overlapped with the full text paper (<LINK REF="STD-Gershberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gershberg 1977</LINK>). Follow-up intervals were 16 to 26 weeks and a weight loss of 3.8 kg (95% CI 2.3 to 5.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1977</LINK>) and 5.7 kg (95% CI, 1.9 - 7.9) were noted. Small, favorable changes in fasting blood sugar (p &gt; 0.05), total cholesterol (P &lt; 0.05), triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05), and blood pressure (p &gt; 0.05) were noted. Irritability and insomnia were noted in the first week of treatment in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gershberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gershberg 1977</LINK>), and dry mouth and a minor sleep disturbance in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1977</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-02 17:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This meta-analysis provides evidence that fluoxetine, orlistat and sibutramine can achieve modest but statistically significant short-term weight loss when used as a primary weight reduction strategy among adults with type 2 diabetes. Since treatment duration was up to 57 weeks for these three drugs, the long-term effects of these drugs on weight and health outcomes in persons with type 2 diabetes remain uncertain. Across studies, participants were middle aged, were for the most part not using insulin, and were in moderately poor glycemic control. BMI was infrequently reported, making it difficult to characterize the degree of overweight of participants. Since study populations might be highly selected and run-in periods eliminated noncompliant participants in some studies, our findings should be considered generalizable only to similar populations and not, for example, to the elderly.</P>
<P>There were few studies examining other drugs used for weight loss in populations with diabetes. Significant weight loss was seen in a small number of studies examining mazindol, phenmetrazine, and phentermine.</P>
<P>Weight loss from pharmacotherapy in nondiabetic populations is generally also modest, ranging from 2 kg to 10 kg; weight is usually regained after discontinuation of the drug; and generally there is no difference between treatment and placebo groups several months after treatment ends (<LINK REF="REF-National-Task-Force" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Task Force</LINK>). The rather small reductions in weight noted in the current review may reflect the difficulty persons with diabetes have in losing weight (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>). Greenway (<LINK REF="REF-Greenway-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenway 1999</LINK>) compared weight loss with orlistat and sibutramine in populations with and without diabetes and noted that weight loss was 52% and 69% greater for the subjects without diabetes.</P>
<P>This review has important limitations. Publication bias is possible in weight loss intervention studies (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1996</LINK>) and pharmacotherapy trials, which are often sponsored and financed by drug manufacturers. We attempted to obtain unpublished studies from the manufacturers of each of the included drugs as well as from researchers in this field, but received no data. We tried to minimize language bias by not excluding studies based on language of publication. Published drug trials funded by for-profit organizations have been shown to have more positive conclusions about the drug than studies funded by nonprofit organizations (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielson 2003</LINK>). Although the causes for this association are not known, possible explanations include biased interpretation of trial results and reporting.<BR/>
<BR/>The quality of individual studies in this review was fairly consistent and common deficiencies were noted. Methods for concealing allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) were described in only one study, and randomization method was described in only two. Most studies were described as double-blind, but it was unclear which two parties were blinded. As Devereaux and colleagues have discussed (<LINK REF="REF-Devereaux-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereaux 2002</LINK>), the term double-blind can have various definitions and interpretations among clinicians and researchers. Blinding may be difficult due to drug specific adverse events, for example, gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat. The reported data were too homogeneous to explore the effects of allocation concealment and blinding on outcomes. The quality of descriptive information on study population, setting, and the intervention was generally adequate. Sampling frame and the method of recruitment and selection of participants were rarely described, however, making it difficult to conclude from individual and pooled studies, to whom the interventions can be applied.</P>
<P>Attrition is an important issue in weight-loss studies because selective loss to follow-up has been demonstrated; higher attrition occurs among those who do not achieve a weight-loss goal (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1987</LINK>). Attrition was often very significant in the control group, particularly for orlistat, perhaps because control participants became unblinded due to fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and had weight loss expectations that were not being fulfilled. Last-outcome-carried-forward data were presented in a number of studies, which could have variable effects on measured outcomes depending on when the participant dropped out. If drug treatment was effective and the participant dropped out early after achieving minimal weight loss, final outcomes would be biased toward the null effect. If participants dropped out after 4 to 6 months in the longer follow-up studies, however, their departure weight might have been lower than it would have been had they completed the study, as other researchers have noted that weight loss with pharmacotherapy tends to plateau at 6 months (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Task-Force" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Task Force</LINK>). We had to exclude from our sensitivity analysis of the effect of attrition in intervention groups, studies that used Last-outcome-carried-forward techniques. Ideally, researchers would provide complete data on all subjects, including last measured weight and time and reason for attrition, particularly in studies of longer duration. The sensitivity analysis for fluoxetine demonstrates that with conservative assumptions for weight loss in the intervention dropouts, weight loss is smaller but remains statistically significant.</P>
<P>Orlistat, sibutramine and fluoxetine were generally well tolerated, and produced a low incidence of serious adverse events. Participants who took orlistat noted a high incidence of minor gastrointestinal side effects, as would be expected from the drug's mechanism. The use of orlistat has been associated with lower levels of fat soluble vitamins and supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 1998</LINK>), although this was only evident in one study in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1998</LINK>). A variety of minor gastrointestinal and other side effects were noted with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Yanovski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanovski 2002</LINK>) and no cases were reported of withdrawal due to major adverse events.</P>
<P>Sibutramine produced palpitations and a nonsignificant increase in pulse rate consistent with its mechanism as a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Yanovski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanovski 2002</LINK>). Palpitations led to withdrawal from one study in two of 69 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Serrano_x002d_Rios-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serrano-Rios 2002</LINK>). Major adverse cardiovascular events were not noted and rates of rhythm disturbances were similar in the intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2000</LINK>). We found no significant blood pressure increase with sibutramine, however, only four studies reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Serrano_x002d_Rios-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Serrano-Rios 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fujioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fujioka 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNulty-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McNulty 2003</LINK>). Concerns have been raised about the safety of sibutramine after review of post-marketing data (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Health-Canada" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Canada</LINK> and a number of European countries are reviewing the safety of sibutramine, and Italy temporarily suspended marketing of the drug in March 2002 after adverse events (tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias) and two deaths were associated with use of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Canada" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Canada</LINK>).</P>
<P>In nondiabetic populations, comprehensive, intensive group behavioral programs without pharmacotherapy produce mean losses of 8 kg to 10 kg at six months with a regain of 30% to 35% of weight loss at one year; 50% of participants have returned to baseline weight at 3 to 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 2000</LINK>). Brown and colleagues reviewed the effectiveness of weight-loss interventions in persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>), and noted that dietary interventions produced a weight loss of 9 kg and behavioral programs 3 kg, but few studies examined outcomes beyond six months. Pharmacotherapy in persons with diabetes thus appears to be no more efficacious than behavioral therapy at 1 year. <LINK REF="REF-Padwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padwal 2004</LINK> recently reviewed the efficacy of long-term pharmacotherapy for weight loss among general populations, including persons with diabetes. They noted a pooled weight change at one year follow-up of -2.7 kg (95% CI 2.3 to 3.1) (11 studies) for orlistat, and 4.3 kg (95% CI 3.6 to 4.9) (five studies) for sibutramine. Similar results were observed in weight maintenance trials at up to tow year follow-up.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-02 17:32:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Although the weight loss demonstrated in this review is small, evidence in general populations suggests that modest loss may have health benefits. There are positive associations between weight loss and blood pressure, blood glucose, and serum lipid levels over a range of weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2001</LINK>). Although few of our studies examined blood pressure, the magnitude of weight loss demonstrated in this review is equivalent to weight changes that have been efficacious in managing and preventing hypertension in high-risk individuals over 2 to 4 years (<LINK REF="REF-Valdez--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdez 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fluoxetine and orlistat had statistically significant effects on GHb. The reduction of 1.0% for fluoxetine at 8 to 26 week follow-up was sustained at 52 weeks in one study (1.8%) (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kane-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kane 1994</LINK>). This reduction in GHb is encouraging given that the magnitude achieved was similar to that in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>) and in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>), where 1% absolute reductions in HbA1c resulted in significant reductions in microvascular complications from diabetes.</P>
<P>Orlistat was associated with statistically significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides, that were sustained at 52 weeks follow-up. These changes in lipid levels have been noted by others (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>) and although modest improvements, they correspond to changes associated with a decrease in the incidence of ischemic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>). It remains unclear whether the improved glycemic control and lipid levels noted in this review could be maintained over the long-term to influence the risk of complications as demonstrated in large trials.</P>
<P>The populations in the studies reviewed were generally self- or researcher-selected, and often noncompliant patients were excluded from analyses. Therefore the efficacy of these drugs as delivered in a real-world setting, will likely be less than that noted in these studies.</P>
<P>Concerns have been raised about adverse cardiovascular effects of sibutramine. Since this review was confined to populations with diabetes, we were not able to present a lot of information on adverse effects. Since persons with diabetes are at particularly high risk of cardiovascular events, the safety of sibutramine is of critical importance in this population, particularly if this drug is used in the long-term.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-02 17:32:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>No studies in this review examined the efficacy of pharmacotherapy combined with a comprehensive lifestyle or behavioral-modification program. In general populations, drugs have been combined with various lifestyle interventions, but most trials include relatively weak lifestyle programs, perhaps in part to better reveal the medication effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 1999a</LINK>). There is some evidence that adding a lifestyle intervention improved treatment with pharmacotherapy in general obese populations (<LINK REF="REF-Craighead-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craighead 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 2001a</LINK>). Because moderate physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1999</LINK>) and improved lipid levels (<LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>) can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of weight change, combined interventions can likely achieve improved health outcomes.</P>
<P>It is clear that obesity in persons with diabetes must be treated aggressively in the long-term, as one would treat any other cardiovascular disease risk factor. Various potential approaches need to be examined in the future. Although pharmacotherapy has been used in nondiabetic populations for treatment lasting longer than one year (<LINK REF="REF-Hauner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauner 1999</LINK>), further research is needed with long-term follow-up of large populations with diabetes. More data are needed on health outcomes such as cardiovascular events, in addition to risk factors. Populations with broad ranges of BMI, age, and ethnicity need to be studied. Research is needed on the efficacy and safety of over-the-counter drugs that persons with diabetes are using for weight loss, and additional research is also needed on other drugs that appear promising in populations without diabetes. Goldstein has suggested that a targeted approach may be useful and that further research is needed to identify subsets of patients who can safely achieve and maintain long-term weight loss with initial pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1994a</LINK>). Several years ago, <LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 1987</LINK> suggested an incremental approach with repeated goal-setting for small amounts of weight loss; perhaps intermittent pharmacotherapy could be used with this approach. Future research must address reporting deficiencies noted in this literature, particularly descriptions of the sampling frame, methods of participant recruitment, and details of accompanying dietary interventions. Ideally, an analysis of individual patient data should be performed to examine relationships between weight loss and patient-level characteristics such as age and initial weight.</P>
<P>Further work is needed to examine whether the combination of lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy improves the efficacy of drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 2002</LINK>), whether such combinations are synergistic or additive (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 2002</LINK>), and what dosage schedules and sequencing of the two interventions are optimal. The incidence of adverse events must be carefully monitored over the long term in diabetic populations, which already have multiple risk factors for major cardiovascular and neurologic events. The advancement of research in these areas will help reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors and events for persons with type 2 diabetes.</P>

<P>I could not find this reference in Diabetes - on that date, page and volume is another paper. A pub med search did not reveal the true source of this: Guy-Grand B, Valensi P, Joubert JM, Eschwege E, Amouyel P, Fagnani F. Modelisation of the 10-year incidence reduction of coronary events in obese Type 2 diabetes patients treated with Orlistat. Diabetes 2002;51:1938. Can you help me find the correct link?<BR/>I have just sent a request stating that one of the articles had an incorrect link. On continuing to go through the references I have found another problem: Hanefeld M, Platon J, Sachse G. Orlistat promotes weight loss and improves glycaemic control in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. Diabetologia 2001;44:889 - the link goes to another article altogether.  <BR/>THIRD reference with incorrect link and not found at journal web site/pubmed or any other place: Hawkins F, Duran S, Vilardell E, Soriguer F, Cabezas J, Escobar F, Milalles JM, Faure E, Bellido D, Herrera JL, Serrano-Rios M, Tebar J, Freijane J, Armero F. Orlistat promotes glucemia control and other cardiovascular risk factors lowering in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomised clinical trial. Diabetologia 2000;43:658. I am now questioning both my own searching but seriously worried about this paper .......</P>
