I am afraid this review cannot be published without major revision. The title is calorie-control and one trial is clearly about this (Stenius). The other trials relate a short term milk challenge (Haas) and oil supplementation. This is really not the same topic this review must be changed to focus on the calorie control. This means that the supplementation diets will need to be excluded and mentioned in the discussion. The background is written as if the review is primarily about modification of fats and needs to be more in line with calorie control.&lt;br&gt;The description of Stenius needs to be made consistent (see below), very low energy diet is the term used by the trialists so this would be most appropriate description.&lt;br&gt;I am sorry that further work needs to be done on this review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Second Peer Review comments recieved 8 Feb 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stenius 2000 study diet is variously described as &amp;quot; very low calorie diet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; low fat diet &amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;low energy diet&amp;quot; in different sections. This should be consistent. The actual number of calories in this diet should also be specific. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Peer Review comments Jan 2005 are shown below. These highlight some serious difficulties with the review and it cannot be published in its current form. I suggest that you take up the suggestion to limit this review to the effects of calorie controlled diets in chronic asthma and leave out the trials on variation in types of fat. We need more details about the calories in the arms of the Stenius trial. I am afraid this will need a major revision. CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I found this to be a very confusing review since the title suggests that it is supposed to focus upon calorie restriction but it:&lt;br&gt;a) includes alot of information about types of macronutrients in the background;&lt;br&gt;b) does not provide an idea of the caloric intakes in the studies that did use caloric restriction (Stenius and maybe Haas)&lt;br&gt;c) includes two studies of variation in type of fat that probably did not involve calorie restriction (and additionally excludes other studies of this type).&lt;br&gt;In my view the reviewers should have identified only those studies that used calorie restriction and excluded those that changed one type of fat for another since these are looking at the question of type of fat not limitation in calories. It is not clear why a study with perilla oil (Okamoto) is included but studies with fish oil are not. A study using fish oil supplementation vs. placebo oil supplementation is still using a &amp;quot;same calorie diet&amp;quot; but with &amp;quot;different dietary fat&amp;quot; and so falls within the objective of the review. As a result I think this is not a satisfactory review of the proposed topic. Nowhere does it indicate whether the studies were in adults or children.&lt;br&gt;It is odd that a review of calorie restriction dies not mention caloric intakes in the different arms of a study (Stenius). Details of the extent of obesity are not provided. Is calorie restriction, a low fat diet or weight loss the cause of the changes observed by Stenius? This is not addressed. &lt;br&gt;The discussion indicates that all four studies were in obese subjects: &amp;quot;we did not identify any studies &amp;#8230;. were not obese&amp;quot;. Is this correct?&lt;br&gt;The conclusion makes a statement about n-3 fatty acids that is misleading since the reviewers have not reviewed use if &amp;quot;n-3 fatty acids instead of other oils&amp;quot; in asthma since this would require them to look at all studies of n-3 fatty acids including fish oils vs. placebo oils.&lt;br&gt;Overall I found this to lack detail and to be very difficult to follow. There are too many general statements that are unsubstantiated. It might be better to review calorie restriction and variation in fat type separately.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=======================================================================&lt;br&gt;cjc edit 23 dec 04&lt;br&gt;Thanks for changing the labels. Could you amend to polyunsaturated in the comparison titles for comparisons 3 and 4 and the group labels need to reflect this as well please.&lt;br&gt;Morris reads better so this too will then be ready for peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=======================================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.6&lt;br&gt;2nd Dec 2004&lt;br&gt;Thanks Toby,&lt;br&gt;I have not rechecked your GIV calculations in detail but could you check the group titles as they are too long and overlap at present. Also 4#4 has no group labels. The new sentence in the discussion about Morris is rather unclear - what point were you making. I do not think it should be added in current format as it does not really add to the review. Could we discuss?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;11th November 2004 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris, &lt;br&gt; I have been through the data for the studies. There was some under-usage of raw data (data not entered when it could have been basically) and I have now rectified this with GIV as the Morris 2001 study was of a crossover design. Effectively this study contained two sets of comparisons, and I have added two comparisons in RevMan to reflect this. It does merit a little comment and I have highlighted the additional text in red in the Discussion section. You probably ought to see the data one last time before it goes out to peer review, as I have altered the structure of the comparisons a little bit, and in light of the additional text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Liz Arnold has read, revised and approved the search strategy 111104&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 21 Oct 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine.

The modification of dietary fats may overlap with this and would for example include the Atkins diet (carbohydrate restriction rather that calorie reduction). The issue is a bit broader than just reduced calories so I have added modification of dietary fat into the inclusion criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the authors and Peter feel that this reflects the intent of the review it can go onto the next submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Calorie-controlled diet for chronic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Calorie-controlled diet for chronic asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Calorie-controlled diet for chronic asthma (WITH CHRIS 080305)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-21 16:07:28 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="DIET-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="4.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>It is thought that high calorie diets may contribute to the development of asthma. Theoretically, reducing the amount of calorie consumed as part of a diet may help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma. This review was limited by the small size of the studies and the obese population of asthma patients recruited to the study. No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of dietary manipulation, and more research is required. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The prevalence of asthma has increased in recent years. Epidemiological studies suggest a correlation between the onset of asthma and dietary nonallergic factors especially high calorie diet. These can be regarded as other potentially important risk factors.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To observe the effect of dietary calorie reduction on chronic asthma in adults or children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials using prespecified terms. We assessed bibliographies from included studies, and contacted authors of known studies for additional information about published and unpublished trials. Date of most recent search: May 2006</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised-controlled trials of dietary calorie reduction were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three authors assessed each study independently. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Quality assessment was performed independently.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial of fair methodological quality with a total of 38 patients suffering from chronic asthma was included. There were significant increases in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC in the active treatment group compared with control. No data pertaining serious adverse effects were reported from the interventions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently a very small amount of evidence assessing the effects of dietary interventions intended as part of a wide-ranging weight-loss programme. Whilst we are unable to recommend these strategies as concomitant interventions with drug-based therapy for the specific management of asthma, dietary interventions such as weight-loss programmes may provide benefits in specific patients. However, the impact of a calorie-controlled diet on the signs and symptoms of asthma in the general asthmatic population is yet to be established. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-21 16:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Recent epidemiological studies have attempted to explain increasing prevalence of allergic diseases, including asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR), especially in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Busse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busse 2000</LINK>). Three studies have examined the relationship between dietary nonallergic factors and asthma and AR. Protein-rich and fat-rich foods of animal origin have been linked with a higher prevalence of asthma and AR in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2001</LINK>). Nasal hyperreactivity becomes more noticeable as consumption of dietary fat, salt and sugar increases (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2002</LINK>). The diet of economically developed countries and urban areas of the developing world are now relatively low in cereals, tubers and other starchy foods and relatively high in sugar, fat, protein of animal origin, salt, meat, dairy produce and alcohol. These food types, among other risk factors, may contribute to an increase in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ellwood-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellwood 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of studies have now reported on the association between symptoms of asthma and obesity, both in adults and in children or adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Chinn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 2003</LINK>). Obesity and asthma are not known to be causally associated, but because of the high prevalence of obesity a large number of asthmatic people are obese. Recent UK guidelines recommend weight-loss in obese people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Allergen, pollution and infection are currently the main stay in risk factors of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2004</LINK>). One remaining question is whether dietary nonallergic factors can be regarded as another risk factor. </P>
<P>The role of dietary nonallergic factors in asthma is a potentially important field for study. A European-based study indicated an association between trans-fatty acids and the prevalence of childhood asthma, rhinitis and eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Weiland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiland 1999</LINK>). High dietary cholesterol may enhance pulmonary allergic inflammation in mice (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2001</LINK>). When mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with lard or soybean oil, mast cell numbers in the tracheal mucosa were increased in obese mice upon sensitisation by ovalbumin compared with non-obese control mice (<LINK REF="REF-Mito-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mito 2002</LINK>). Allergic inflammation and mast cell numbers are important characteristics of airway inflammation in asthma.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-21 16:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The long-term findings of significant effects in terms of lung function, symptoms, quality of life and rescue medication usage were from the single study which was conducted in obese people with asthma, who were also given an additional education based intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius 2000</LINK>). The applicability of the findings from this study in non-obese people with asthma remains unclear.</P>
<P>On the basis of the current body of evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the effects of dietary interventions in general asthma management. Weight-loss in obese people with asthma may be advisable for general long-term health reasons outside of asthma control such as the prevention of coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2004</LINK>). The benefits in asthma control observed in the small study require validation in larger and more rigorous trials.</P>
<P>Cochrane reviews assessing the effects of dietary interventions in the treatment of asthma have assessed the effects of supplementing diet (<LINK REF="REF-Thien-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thien 2004</LINK> (fish oil); <LINK REF="REF-Allam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allam 2004</LINK> (selenium); <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2004b</LINK> (vitamin C)), avoiding certain foodstuffs (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2004a</LINK> (dietary salt); <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2004c</LINK> (tartrazine)). Interventions which assess supplements or avoidance of allergens would not focus on the diet of an individual as a whole, and so would not take account of calorie intake.</P>
<P>The prevalence of GOR in asthma is estimated at between 34% and 89%, and it has been suggested that asthma symptoms could occur after eating a large or a high-fat meal (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1997</LINK>). It has been common practice to proscribe milk for asthmatics because its putative stimulation of mucus production can exacerbate asthma symptoms. One of the excluded studies for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Haas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 1991</LINK>) compared the effects of ingestion 16 oz of whole milk (16g lipid), skimmed milk (2g lipid) and water (each on a separate day) on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLco) in 11 asthmatic patients.The two milk types did not significantly change FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, however, DLco decreased progressively over the three hours by 6.8 % per hour after whole milk (maximum reduction 21%) but not after water or skimmed milk.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of these studies do not provide conclusive evidence that interventions designed to take in a very low calorie diet may be of benefit in controlling asthma. Weight reduction in obese people with asthma was shown to be effective in the study and it may be advisable for general health reasons. The impact of dietary interventions on asthma in non-obese people has not been adequately researched. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies involving larger numbers of people with asthma are required which assess the following questions:</P>
<P>Weight reduction in obese people with asthma. These studies should examine whether weight reduction leads to improved asthma control, and whether diet and lifestyle affect the course of chronic asthma.</P>
<P>Further studies are required which provide evidence that dietary interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake are effective in people with asthma.</P>
<P>In these studies adequate measurement of lung function, symptoms (including gastro-oesophageal reflux) and quality of life should be made at long term follow-up.</P>

<P>The treatment group: a weight reduction programme that included 12 group sessions and lasted 14 wk, including eight wk-"the dieting period"-in which participants took a very low energy dietary preparation. The daily dose gave 1760kj of energy and contained daily allowances of all essential nutrients.<BR/>Cointervention (behavioural therapy): The patients were encouraged to increase physical activity and exercise corresponding to an extra 30-minute walk daily.<BR/>The control group had sessions at the same intervals as the treatment group; each session lasted half an hour, during which time themes chosen by the group were discussed freely. These themes were discussed with the treatment group at later sessions; by the end of the first year each group had had the same amount of education about asthma and allergy.<BR/>All participants received normal medical care throughout the study<BR/>
