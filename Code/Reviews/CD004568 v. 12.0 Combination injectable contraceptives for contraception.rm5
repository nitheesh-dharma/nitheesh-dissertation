<TITLE>Injectable birth control with both progestin and estrogen</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 18:52:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Birth control methods that can be injected may contain two hormones, a progestin and an estrogen. These combined injectable contraceptives (CICs) are effective in preventing pregnancy and can be stopped when a woman wants to get pregnant. This review looked at CICs for how well they prevented pregnancy and for the bleeding patterns and other side effects that may occur. We also studied whether women stopped using them early and whether women liked them.</P>
<P>In January and February 2013, we did computer searches to find randomized trials of combination injectable contraceptives. We included studies that compared a CIC with another birth control method. The other method could be another injectable contraceptive, either combined or having only a progestin. The CIC could also be compared to another hormonal method (like the pill) or to condoms, the diaphragm, or a placebo (or 'dummy').</P>
<P>We found 12 trials that studied four types of CICs. The combined methods required monthly injections. Four trials compared a CIC to 'depo', which has only a progestin. 'Depo' injections should be taken every three months. Five trials compared a CIC with a different combined injectable. Three trials compared a combined injectable with a different dose of the same hormones, with a progestin-only injectable, or with an intrauterine device (IUD).</P>
<P>More women using combined injectables had normal bleeding than women using progestin-only injectables like 'depo.' Also, fewer women using CICs stopped using them because of bleeding reasons than progestin-only users. However, users of combined injectables were more likely to stop using them overall and to stop for other medical reasons. Many factors can affect whether women keep using the method, including whether the women liked it.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-21 19:38:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Combination injectable contraceptives (CICs) provide a highly effective, reversible method of preventing pregnancy, and they do not require daily administration or use at the time of coitus. Although they are used in many countries, their acceptability could be limited by method characteristics, such as the need to obtain a monthly injection or bleeding pattern changes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-09-21 19:38:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>To assess the contraceptive efficacy, bleeding patterns, discontinuation, user preferences, and side effects of CICs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 18:05:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>In January and February 2013, we searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of combination injectable contraceptives. Databases include MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS. We searched for current trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Earlier searches also included AIM and IMEMR. For the initial review, we also assessed the references listed in review articles and in the eligible trial reports.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-19 18:50:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>RCTs were eligible if they compared a combination injectable contraceptive with any other contraceptive method (e.g., a second CIC, a progestin-only injectable contraceptive, another hormonal contraceptive or a barrier method) or a placebo. We limited the review to marketed CICs.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-09-21 20:13:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data on contraceptive efficacy, bleeding patterns, continuation, and side effects. We calculated the Peto odds ratio or mean difference with 95% confidence interval for dichotomous or continuous outcome, respectively. Survival analysis estimates for method discontinuation were presented where available.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-21 20:15:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. Combination injectable contraceptives include depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) 25 mg plus estradiol cypionate (E<SUB>2</SUB>C) 5 mg, as well as norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) 50 mg plus estradiol valerate (E<SUB>2</SUB>V) 5 mg. These contraceptives resulted in lower rates of early study discontinuation due to amenorrhea or other bleeding problems than progestin-only contraceptives. However, rates were higher for overall discontinuation and discontinuation due to other medical reasons. Acceptability results favored the CIC in one study and the progestin-only in another.</P>
<P>Studies comparing two CICs found that NET-EN 50 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V 5 mg resulted in less overall discontinuation and less discontinuation due to amenorrhea or prolonged bleeding than DMPA 25 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C 5 mg. However, these differences were not detected in all trials. The NET-EN plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V group also had more regular bleeding and fewer prolonged bleeding reference periods than the DMPA plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C group. The groups did not differ in their amenorrhea rates.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-21 20:14:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>While discontinuation rates can be viewed as a measure of method acceptability, the findings should be interpreted with caution since discontinuation depends on many factors. Future research should be directed toward improving the acceptability of combination injectable contraceptives, such as providing injections in settings more convenient than clinics, methods for women to administer their own injections, and counseling about possible bleeding pattern changes.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-19 18:55:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Combined injectable contraceptives, which contain a progestin plus an estrogen, were developed to address troublesome side effects of progestin-only formulations. Negative effects of progestin-only injectables include disruption in bleeding patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2007</LINK>), as well as the long duration of contraception. The median delay to conception after use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is 9 to 10 months after the last injection, which is longer than with other hormonal methods (<LINK REF="REF-Schwallie-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwallie 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pardthaisong-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardthaisong 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2000</LINK>). Also, the drug takes months to be metabolized after the method is discontinued. This is a disadvantage for women who experience unpleasant side effects.</P>
<P>With an estrogen (such as estradiol cypionate) added to the long-acting progestin (such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), bleeding cycles are more regular than they are with injectable progestin-only methods (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2007</LINK>). In women not using hormonal contraceptives, bleeding occurs when serum estrogen and progesterone levels fall and the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is shed. Progestin-only contraceptives may produce a thin endometrium that can bleed irregularly and unpredictably. The estrogen component of a combined hormonal contraceptive may build up the endometrium and therefore regulate bleeding patterns. When women use combined oral contraceptives in a cyclical manner, bleeding occurs when the estrogen is withdrawn, and this mimics a typical menstrual period. Given monthly, combined injectable contraceptives allow the serum estrogen levels to fall in a similar manner, and this produces withdrawal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) supported the development of two combination injectables. For this review, nine formulations were considered that were marketed in Latin America, Asia, and Africa under various brand names (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IPPF-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPPF 2010</LINK>). Combination injectable contraceptives are given on a monthly basis, which is more convenient for some women than the daily oral contraception regimen. However, the monthly administration is more frequent than that for progestin-only injectables (every two or three months, depending on the progestin). The injections are usually provided in a clinical site or medical office. As with the progestin-only formulations, combination injectable contraceptives are discreet, and therefore they provide confidentiality. Combination injectables feature a more rapid return to fertility than progestin-only injectables (<LINK REF="REF-Bassol-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassol 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bahamondes-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahamondes 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaunitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaunitz 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review summarizes the randomized controlled trials that compared a combined injectable contraceptive with another contraceptive. Previously, little was known about the comparative efficacy and acceptability of combined injectable contraceptives. The focus of the review is on efficacy, continuation rates, and side effects.</P>

An additional formulation was marketed, i.e., progestin 50 mg and estradiol benzoate 5 mg for a new total of seven formulations.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Measures of contraceptive efficacy, bleeding patterns, continuation, user preferences, and side effects were eligible. Side effects include reported medical or social events that possibly were related to the study treatment. However, rare events (e.g., thrombosis or cancer) could not be adequately studied in this review since randomized controlled trials generally do not have enough power for studying the risk of these events. Biochemical measures were not eligible.</P>

Some studies used 90-day reference periods for recording bleeding patterns (<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>). If outcomes were reported for multiple reference periods, we reported the outcomes for the first and last reference periods only. <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> has information on the length of each study.</P>
<P>The review was limited to the analytic method used in the trial report (e.g., intent to treat, per protocol, or a modification of either type). Studies were combined for meta-analysis only when identical drugs, dosages, and regimens were compared. We assessed the homogeneity of trials combined in meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. The alpha level was set at 0.10 since the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity is a low power test. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of any results that appeared to be based on heterogeneous combinations by examining the effect of deleting each study. Trials were critically appraised by evaluating the potential for bias resulting from the study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, and loss to follow up.</P>

<P>Four trials compared a combination to a progestin-only injectable contraceptive containing DMPA (<LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simbar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simbar 2007</LINK>).

The mid-sized study of <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK> had more discontinuation among the women assigned to the combination injectable compared to the progestin-only group (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.43 to 3.50). The smaller trial of <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 1998</LINK> also had higher odds of early discontinuation with the combination than the progestin-only group, but the effect estimate was imprecise (OR 8.41; 95% CI 1.82 to 38.77). In <LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK>, women in the progestin-only group were more likely to discontinue for amenorrhea or all bleeding problems (i.e., prolonged bleeding, heavy and prolonged bleeding, irregular bleeding, or spotting) than the combination group (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In contrast, the combination injectable users were more likely than the progestin-only group to discontinue early for other medical reasons (e.g., headache, not feeling well, or weight change) or personal reasons. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK>, the study groups were similar for discontinuation due to menstrual changes as well as non-menstrual medical reasons.</P>
<P>The combination-injectable group was generally less likely to report bleeding irregularities. <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 1998</LINK> measured amenorrhea as any occurrence during the study period (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.13). <LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK> were combined in a meta-analysis for this outcome. Both trials measured amenorrhea during the first and fourth reference periods. The combination-injectable group was less likely than the progestin-only group to report amenorrhea; the ORs were 0.23 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.34) for the first reference period and 0.10 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.14) for the fourth. In <LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK>, the combination-injectable group was less likely to report infrequent bleeding measured during the first (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.31) or fourth (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.87) reference periods. In addition, the combination-injectable group had higher odds of regular (cyclical) bleeding patterns in the first (OR 4.93; 95% CI 3.48 to 7.00) and fourth (OR 6.14; 95% CI 4.19 to 9.00) reference periods than the progestin-only injectable group (<LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Differences in prolonged bleeding and irregular bleeding between the groups were less clear.

In <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK>, the combination-injectable group was more likely than the progestin-only group to have more than five days of bleeding during the first (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.20) and fourth (OR 5.29; 95% CI 2.59 to 10.78) reference periods. Mean days of bleeding were similar for the groups in <LINK REF="STD-Simbar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Simbar 2007</LINK> during the first reference period. For <LINK REF="STD-Cuong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cuong 1996</LINK>, the combination group was more likely to have irregular bleeding in the fourth reference period than the progestin-only group (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.41 to 5.36) but not in the first period. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK>, the combination-injectable group was more likely to have moderate or severe intermenstrual bleeding during the first reference period (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65) but not during the fourth.</P>
<P>Women in the combination-injectable group in the <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 1998</LINK> trial were more likely to report intention to continue their assigned method at the study end than those in the progestin-only group (OR 10.52; 95% CI 4.71 to 23.49). However, the wide confidence interval indicates imprecision in this finding. In contrast, somewhat fewer of the combination-injectable group in <LINK REF="STD-Ruminjo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruminjo 2005</LINK> reported their experience with the method to have been 'very favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.02) than did those in the progestin-only group.</P>

These differences, though, were not apparent with the life-table estimates.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 19:36:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>No differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness rates between the comparisons. Since injectable contraceptives are a highly effective method, though, the studies had insufficient power to study this outcome.</P>
<P>We did not include outcomes related to side effects that were reported during clinic visits with open-ended questioning. The combination injectable contraceptive users had more frequent clinic visits and, therefore, more opportunities to report these effects. Side effect data would have to be collected under comparable conditions in the study groups to avoid biased estimates.</P>
<P>The combination injectable contraceptive containing DMPA 25 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C 5 mg resulted in less amenorrhea and discontinuation due to amenorrhea or all bleeding problems than the contraceptive containing the same type of progestin (DMPA 150 mg) but without estrogen. However, the combination-injectable group was more likely to discontinue overall than the progestin-only group as well as due to other medical reasons (e.g., headache or not feeling well) or personal reasons. Similarly, the only other comparison between a combination and a progestin-only contraceptive with the same progestin type (NET-EN 50 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V 5 mg versus NET-EN 200 mg) found that the combination group had more cyclical (regular) bleeding and fewer infrequent bleeding reference periods than the progestin-only contraceptive group. Again, the combination injectable group was more likely to discontinue for other reasons (i.e., overall, other medical reasons, personal reasons, late for or lost to follow up) than the progestin-only group. The higher rates of early discontinuation for reasons other than disruptions to bleeding patterns with the combination injectable contraceptives could be an indicator of poor acceptability of the requirement for more frequent clinic visits. In a demonstration project in California, established users of DMPA 150 mg could obtain re-injections from pharmacists (<LINK REF="REF-PharmacyAccess-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">PharmacyAccess 2005</LINK>). Early results suggest the program may be appropriate for women who can manage their injection cycle and do not need clinic attention (<LINK REF="REF-Maderas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maderas 2007</LINK>). In Uganda, community-based health workers provided DMPA injections in a nonrandomized trial (<LINK REF="REF-Stanback-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanback 2007</LINK>). Continuation to second injection was comparable to that for clinic-based clients, and the groups were similar for safety and acceptability measures. A study conducted in Brazil indicated that many women can be trained to self-administer a monthly injectable contraceptive (<LINK REF="REF-Bahamondes-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahamondes 1997b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies comparing two combination injectable contraceptives found that NET-EN 50 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V 5 mg resulted in less overall early discontinuation and less discontinuation due to amenorrhea or prolonged bleeding than DMPA 25 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C 5 mg. The NET-EN plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V group also had more regular (cyclical) bleeding and fewer prolonged bleeding reference periods than the DMPA plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C group. The groups did not differ in their amenorrhea rates. However, the statistical significance of almost all of these findings was dependent on one trial conducted in China (<LINK REF="STD-Sang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1995</LINK>), and the differences generally were not detected in the other populations studied.</P>
<P>The injectable contraceptive NET-EN 50 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V 5 mg led to more early discontinuation due to bleeding than a comparison copper IUD.</P>
<P>The acceptability of changes in bleeding patterns can vary across cultures as well as between individual women (<LINK REF="REF-Glasier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 2003</LINK>). For example, some women could perceive amenorrhea as a benefit of a contraceptive method, while others could be concerned due to uncertainty regarding possible pregnancy or cultural beliefs about regular menses. Also, the degree to which women are willing to tolerate bleeding pattern disruptions could be affected by other factors, such as the provision of counseling regarding these effects or the availability of other reliable and acceptable methods. Therefore, the results of these trials should be interpreted with caution since the discontinuation rates are dependent on many factors.</P>

<P>Combination injectable contraceptives (DMPA 25 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>C 5 mg and NET-EN 50 mg plus E<SUB>2</SUB>V 5 mg) led to more regular (cyclical) bleeding, less amenorrhea, and fewer infrequent bleeding patterns than the comparison progestin-only injectables (i.e., DMPA 150 mg and NET-EN 200 mg, respectively). The combination injectable contraceptives also resulted in lower rates of early study discontinuation due to amenorrhea or other bleeding problems. However, they had higher rates of discontinuation overall and due to non-bleeding reasons than the progestin-only contraceptives. While discontinuation rates can be viewed as a measure of method acceptability, this acceptability is dependent on the population studied since perceptions of bleeding pattern changes can vary.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research should be directed toward interventions to improve the acceptability of combination injectable contraceptives. Such studies might include administering injections in settings more convenient than the clinical sites in which they are currently provided. There could also be interventions for women to administer their own injections and for counseling about possible bleeding pattern changes.</P>
