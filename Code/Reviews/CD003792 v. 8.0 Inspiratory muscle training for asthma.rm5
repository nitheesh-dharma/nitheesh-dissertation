I would be grateful for Anne Holland's view on the difference of opinion between the peer reviewer (who regards PE Max as a placebo effect) and the green paragraph from the authors in the discussion section (who do not)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan&amp;#237;zia notes 07/02/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the comments, they contributed significantly to this update. The points highlighted in the text were seen carefully and corrected. However remained two points highlighted in the text. I want to know the reasons for these highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update registration form - &lt;/b&gt;Extra info on reporting biases was added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRISMA diagra - &lt;/b&gt;The study flow diagram and description of the search were corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outcomes - &lt;/b&gt;I agree&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that oral/inhaled steroids don't need to be included. The outcome &amp;quot;use of drug&amp;quot; was replaced by &amp;quot;use of reliever medication&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risck of bias - &lt;/b&gt;In Sampaio, I changed the judgement of performance bias to high risk of bias and changed the detection bias to low risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random effects was added for the PImax.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paragraph about asthma symptoms was reviewed and rewritten. Only McConnell 1998 reported the numerical data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A line was added about clinical benefit. There is no evidance of any clinical benefit for the asthmatics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Weiner 1992&quot;&gt;Weiner 1992&lt;/a&gt; was included in previous version of this review (Ram 2003), which contributed with a weight of 52.7% in the meta-analysis, however it is not randomised. Therefore &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Weiner 1992&quot;&gt;Weiner 1992&lt;/a&gt; was excluded of this update. The Paragraph was rewritten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings - &lt;/b&gt;I completed the table. To our knowledge, there are no MID established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma notes 16/01/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for revising and updating this review which does read well. However, please see throughout for corrections to grammar and sentence structure. There are several additional points highlighted in the text which require attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update registration form - &lt;/b&gt;I cross-checked your update registration form with the submitted review and noticed a few small items that needed to be copied across:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the update registration form states that you would create a summary of findings table which needs to be done. I can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added in extra info on reporting biases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;PRISMA&lt;/b&gt; diagram does not seem to match the description of the search. Can you redo it please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sampaio&lt;/b&gt; - does the control group introduce bias? The control group received physio based on clinical assessment. If clinicians gave less physio than they would otherwise this would cause a bias. Or vice versa depending on their view of whether IMTmight be a good intervention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand how the trialists in Weiner 2002a made the decision to terminate treatment can you please elaborate in the text (see highlighted sentence). Later on you describe it well, so please can you copy and paste that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;outcomes - 'use of drug' is not very precise. Did you mean use of reliever medication? Oral/inhaled steroids are covered under exacerbations and so probably don't need to be included here. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of bias&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risk of bias tables had too many rows. I understand what you tried to achieve, but there is no need to have a line on the risk of bias for each outcome. RevMan 5 allows you to split risk of bias domains by outcomes. This can sometimes be useful if certain outcomes are at a higher risk of bias than others. For example, in single-blind COPD trials, the outcome COPD-related exacerbations is a subjective outcome. If the outcome assessor knows what treatment arm the person is they might be more or less likely to assign an exacerbation as COPD-related than 'all cause'. However, death would be an objective measure so in this case you could have two lines in the ROB table for blinding - one for objective outcomes and one for subjective outcomes. Becasue of this, I removed some of the extra lines to help us edit the review. I checked to see if you has split the risk of bias decisions according to whether the outcomes were subjective or objective, but you had not. Therfore I have left in one row for each domain only. I also deleted one of the risk of bias figures as it did not add anything to the review in my opinion and having two figures breaks the flow of the text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;McConnell - This trial is quasi-randomised and is at high risk of bias for sequence generation. I have added in some additional information to th paragraph on risk of bias.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sampaio - I think that you should change the judgement of performance bias to high risk of bias because it was not done and change detection bias to low or unclear risk of bias as it was stated that it was done and this more closely matches the judgements for the other trials. What do you think?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random and fixed effects need to be reported for the primary outcome, but with considerable heterogeneity maybe the random model results should go in the abstract and SoF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;asthma symptoms - there is insufficient detail in this paragraph. I was not sure whether the trials had reported the data and you had chosen not to present it or whether it was not reported. Can you go back and check please.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add a line to explain whether the statistically significant differences were clinically meaningful or not? What is the MID? please add to the review if an MID has been established&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;In this version was included one trial (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Weiner 1992&quot;&gt;Weiner 1992&lt;/a&gt;) which contributed with a weight of 52.7% in the meta-analysis, however it does not mention the sequence generation process. &amp;quot; the figure 52.7% does not match the meta-analysis. Can you check why this is and edit the review accordingly if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings&lt;/b&gt; - I have created a table for you, but it needs to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;16/06/2003&lt;br&gt;REPLY IN CAPS BELOW FROM FELIX RAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL ISSUES RESOLVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing by CJC 6_6_3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: Please add these Felix!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Effectiveness now reads efficacy in abstract and review. Abbreviation (IMT) taken out of abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: I have switched off the totals for single studies and changed the last 2 outcomes to SMD as the scales are different and preclude the use of WMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: I have altered this slightly: &amp;quot;In moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease there is good evidence of a generalised loss of muscle bulk (including the respiratory muscles). It is possible that similar loss of respiratory muscle strength could occur in asthma, particularly in more severe asthma requiring high doses of steroid therapy. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;DATA ANALYSIS:&lt;br&gt;For all outcomes, the fixed-effect model was used to estimate relative risk (RR). Heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies being pooled was tested for each outcome measure; if present (P&amp;lt;0.05), the random-effects model would have been applied and the source of heterogeneity investigated through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. All estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval. Equivalence was assumed if the RR and its 95% confidence interval is between 0.9 and 1.1.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;All the outcomes in this review are continuous so we need some methodology relating to WMD and SMD. I have changed the final two scales to SMD as noted above......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Unfortunately this overall estimate contained significant heterogeneity which was not corrected by using the random effects analysis.&amp;quot; Felix random effects models cannot CORRECT for heterogeneity but can incorporate it. I have therefore reworded this &amp;quot;As there was significant heterogeneity the WMD was also calculated using a random effects model, but the result remained significant (WMD 17.13 cmH2O, 95% CI 4.25 to 30.02).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lung Function [Comparison 01: 03 to 06]&lt;br&gt;Two studies (McConnell 1998; Weiner 1992) reported FEV1 and FVC. McConnell 1998 reported actual values at the end of study where as Weiner 1992 reported % predicted values, and the combined standardised mean difference was not significant for either outcome: FEV1(SMD 0.33, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.90) and FVC (SMD 1.14, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.77). Only FVC % predicted in the Weiner 1992 was significantly different when compared to the control group (mean difference 15.60 cmH2O, 95%CI 8.81 to 22.39).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have altered the above to report the pooled SMD for FEV1 and FVC. Do you have any problem with this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: none obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to Felix to add methods for continuous outcomes and reviewer contributions. Then out for peer review please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________________&lt;br&gt;CJC 20june2003&lt;br&gt;I am happy with this to go to peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st July 2003&lt;br&gt;Felix,&lt;br&gt;Peer reviewer commented that FVC should not be cm H20 so this has been changed to % predicted in the results section. He also suggested that IMT could be off benefit in terms of beta-agonist use and dyspnoea in those asthmatics with normal muscle strength. I am not convinced that this can be asserted from the review so have just added the possibility to the background. Are you happy with this? This seems reasonable to me as the patients were not preselected for RM weakness as well as asthma were they?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Inspiratory muscle training for asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br&gt;8th July 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with your comments and am happy for the review to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: =Inspiratory muscle training for asthma&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-09-09 09:43:00 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="INSP-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.6 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to find out if inspiratory muscle training (IMT) using an external resistive device is better than no treatment (or usual care) in people with chronic asthma. An external resistive device is something that makes it harder for the patient to breathe in. The idea is that doing breathing exercises with a device that makes it harder to breathe in helps to strengthen the muscles of respiration (for example like lifting a weight) and strengthens the muscles that pump air into the lungs. This would make it easier for the person to breathe during day-to-day life. This review aimed to explore the effect of IMT in asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Asthma is the most common chronic disease found in children and young adults. Clinically, asthma is characterized by symptoms of shortness of breath, wheeze and cough, and episodes of worsening of symptoms. The objective of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain control of the disease and to reduce symptoms. In most cases the symptoms can be controlled with inhalers, but IMT may assist treatment. For people with other chronic respiratory diseases, IMT significantly increases the strength of the inspiratory muscles, reduces dyspnoea and improves quality of life. It is unclear whether inspiratory muscle training has similar benefits in individuals with asthma.</P>
<P>
<B>Study</B> <B>characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found and included five studies in our review. Three studies were conducted by the same group of researchers in Israel (<A HREF="Weiner 2000">Weiner 2000</A>; <A HREF="Weiner 2002">Weiner 2002</A>; <A HREF="Weiner 2002a">Weiner 2002a</A>), one study (<A HREF="Sampaio 2002">Sampaio 2002</A>) was conducted in Brazil and one trial was conduced in the United Kingdom (<A HREF="McConnell 1998">McConnell 1998</A>). A total of 113 adults with asthma (46 male and 67 female) were included. No study included children.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The studies showed a significant improvement in inspiratory muscle strength (PImax). People with asthma who received IMT on average increased their inspiratory muscle strength, but it was not possible to state whether this improvement seen in inspiratory muscle strength translated into any clinical benefit. Results from one study showed no significant difference between the training group and the control group (no treatment or usual care) for expiratory muscle strength, lung function, sensation of dyspnoea (breathlessness) and use of reliever medication. There were no studies describing exacerbation events that required use of reliever medication or emergency department visits, inspiratory muscle endurance, hospital admissions and days off work or school. Given the insufficient evidence found in this review, we believe that there is a need for more well conducted studies in order to assess the efficacy of IMT in people with asthma, including children.</P>

<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There were substantial differences between the studies, including the training protocol, duration of training sessions (10 to 30 minutes) and duration of the intervention (over 3 to 25 weeks). The methodological quality of the studies included in this update was difficult to accurately ascertain. Study samples were small and the risk of bias was mostly unclear, due to inadequate reporting. Overall the quality of the evidence included in the review was very low. This summary was current to November 2012.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-03 10:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>In some people with asthma, expiratory airflow limitation, premature closure of small airways, activity of inspiratory muscles at the end of expiration and reduced pulmonary compliance may lead to lung hyperinflation. With the increase in lung volume, chest wall geometry is modified, shortening the inspiratory muscles and leaving them at a sub-optimal position in their length-tension relationship. Thus, the capacity of these muscles to generate tension is reduced. An increase in cross-sectional area of the inspiratory muscles caused by hypertrophy could offset the functional weakening induced by hyperinflation. Previous studies have shown that inspiratory muscle training promotes diaphragm hypertrophy in healthy people and patients with chronic heart failure, and increases the proportion of type I fibres and the size of type II fibres of the external intercostal muscles in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, its effects on clinical outcomes in patients with asthma are unclear.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-09 09:41:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>We included five studies involving 113 adults. Participants in four studies had mild to moderate asthma and the fifth study included participants independent of their asthma severity. There were substantial differences between the studies, including the training protocol, duration of training sessions (10 to 30 minutes) and duration of the intervention (3 to 25 weeks). Three clinical trials were produced by the same research group. Risk of bias in the included studies was difficult to ascertain accurately due to poor reporting of methods.</P>
<P>The included studies showed a statistically significant increase in inspiratory muscle strength, measured by maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) (mean difference (MD) 13.34 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI 4.70 to 21.98, 4 studies, 84 participants, low quality evidence). Our other primary outcome, exacerbations requiring a course of oral or inhaled corticosteroids or emergency department visits, was not reported. For the secondary outcomes, results from one trial showed no statistically significant difference between the inspiratory muscle training group and the control group for maximal expiratory pressure, peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, sensation of dyspnoea and use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist.

<P>There is no conclusive evidence in this review to support or refute inspiratory muscle training for asthma. The evidence was limited by the small number of trials with few participants together with the risk of bias. More well conducted randomised controlled trials are needed. Future trials should investigate the following outcomes: lung function, exacerbation rate, asthma symptoms, hospital admissions, use of medications and days off work or school. Inspiratory muscle training should also be assessed in people with more severe asthma and conducted in children with asthma.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-03 10:51:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-03 10:40:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>Asthma is considered a serious public health problem worldwide, being the most common chronic disease found in children and young adults (<LINK REF="REF-To-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">To 2012</LINK>). The incidence of asthma has increased during the last three decades, especially in industrialized countries, and is associated with large healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable airflow limitation and airway hyper-responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Bourdin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourdin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gershon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gershon 2012</LINK>). Its symptoms include breathlessness, wheeze and cough together with episodes of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Brightling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brightling 2012</LINK>). Asthma is characterized by a variability of signs and symptoms over time. Its natural history includes persistent chronic inflammation and structural alterations in the lungs that may be associated with persistent symptoms and reduction of lung function, and it is commonly associated with acute episodes of deterioration (<LINK REF="REF-Reddel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddel 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since asthma is not curable, the objective of asthma management is to achieve and maintain control of the disease and to ameliorate symptoms. The treatment aims to ensure control of the clinical manifestations and to control the expected future risk (exacerbations, accelerated decline in lung function, and side effects of treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>). In most people, clinical control of asthma can be achieved with a proper pharmacological treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK>). However, therapy such as pulmonary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Ochmann-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochmann 2012</LINK>) and inspiratory muscle training (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2011</LINK>) may also be beneficial in asthma, by improvement of functional capacity and a reduction in dyspnoea and healthcare services use.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-03 10:40:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>The inspiratory muscles are morphologically and functionally skeletal muscles and therefore respond to training, just as any muscle of the locomotor system (<LINK REF="REF-Romer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romer 2003</LINK>). Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a technique used to increase strength or endurance of the diaphragm and accessory muscles of inspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Illi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are three types of IMT, normocapnic hyperpnoea, flow resistive loading and pressure threshold loading. "Normocapnic hyperpnea is a training approach that requires people to ventilate at a high proportion of their maximum voluntary ventilation for a fixed period using complicated rebreathing circuitry to ensure stable levels of carbon dioxide" (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>). It has not been used frequently in patients because it requires specific and complicated equipment to prevent hypocapnia (<LINK REF="REF-Scherer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 2000</LINK>) and, furthermore, it is very strenuous exercise. </P>
<P>Normocapnic hyperpnoea corresponds to endurance training because it involves high flow and low pressure. In normocapnic hypopnoea training, the inspiratory and expiratory muscles are recruited. Flow resistive loading and pressure threshold loading cause specific recruitment of the inspiratory musculature and promote strength training (<LINK REF="REF-Romer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In flow resistive loading, the individual breathes via a device with a variable-diameter orifice. Thus, for a given airflow, the smaller the orifice the greater the load achieved. In this type of training the inspiratory pressure, and consequently the training load, varies with flow rate according to the orifice size. Therefore, it is essential that the individual respiratory pattern be monitored during the training to ensure an adequate training load (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In threshold loading a device that contains a one-way valve is used. This valve remains closed at the beginning of inspiration and the individual breathes against the spring-loaded valve until enough pressure is generated to release the resistance and allow flow. At expiration, the one-way valve opens and no resistance is imposed on this phase of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 2005a</LINK>). The user experiences a predetermined and constant pressure independent of breathing pattern or flow (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moodie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moodie 2011</LINK>). Threshold loading is the most widely used IMT method because it is portable and easy to use. However, there are no data to support the superiority of one IMT method over the other in asthma, although they have been compared in a systematic review of IMT in healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Illi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illi 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-03 10:51:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>In people with asthma there are four mechanisms leading to lung hyperinflation. These are expiratory airflow limitation; premature closure of the small airways; activity of the inspiratory muscles at the end of expiration; and reduced pulmonary compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Burgel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgel 2009</LINK>). With the increase in lung volume, the chest wall geometry is modified, shortening the inspiratory muscles and leaving them at a sub-optimal position in the length-tension relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Clanton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clanton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reduction of force generated by the inspiratory muscles necessitates an increase in respiratory drive (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McConnell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 2005</LINK>). However, the increase of the maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) resulting from the IMT may significantly reduce the inspiratory motor drive (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2003</LINK>), probably due to a decrease in the number of motor units recruited during breathing, with consequent reduction in the sensation of dyspnoea.</P>
<P>IMT can in some cases promote diaphragm hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Chiappa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiappa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enright-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enright 2006</LINK>) and increase the proportion of type I fibres and the size of the type II fibres of the external intercostal muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Ramirez_x002d_Sarmiento-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramirez-Sarmiento 2002</LINK>). The force generated by skeletal muscles depends on the effective cross-sectional area. Therefore, the increase in cross-sectional area of the inspiratory muscles caused by hypertrophy could reverse or delay the deterioration of inspiratory muscle function (<LINK REF="REF-Enright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enright 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, a variety of factors can affect the efficacy of IMT, including the degree of hyperinflation, severity of airway obstruction, and also the frequency and duration of training (<LINK REF="REF-Liaw-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaw 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:42:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2003, which concluded that there was insufficient evidence on the clinical benefits of IMT in individuals with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>). However, recent meta-analyses showed that IMT significantly increases the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles, reduces dyspnoea and improves exercise capacity and quality of life in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gosselink-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosselink 2011</LINK>); and improves endurance exercise performance in healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Illi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illi 2012</LINK>). New clinical trials evaluating the effects of IMT on muscle strength, peak expiratory flow, exercise tolerance and perception of dyspnoea in asthma have been published since the last version of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lima-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2011</LINK>).

<P>For the previous version of this review, searches were conducted up to April 2003. For this update, the search was amended and run across all years up to 23 November 2012. We identified 127 references for possible inclusion in the review. After adjusting for duplicates 97 remained. From these, two review authors selected 11 abstracts as possibly being appropriate for inclusion in the review. We identified six additional references by searching the bibliographies of the retrieved studies. Therefore, we retrieved a total of 17 full text papers for possible inclusion.

<P>Three were double-blind (assessors and participants) randomised controlled trials and all had run-in phases that varied from two to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Five studies involving 113 people with asthma (46 male and 67 female) met the inclusion criteria. Ten participants dropped out of the studies, so the results of the remaining 103 participants are reported. The sample size of the included studies varied from 18 to 30 adult participants. One study only included participants who had 'high consumption' of bronchodilators, defined as greater than one puff of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist per day (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK> only recruited female participants.</P>
<P>The criteria for a diagnosis of asthma were provided in all included studies. Three trials diagnosed asthma according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria and in one trial asthma was defined by a clinical diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1998</LINK>) diagnosis of asthma was made by a consultant chest physician on the basis of spirometry, examination and history.</P>
<P>Four studies included participants with mild to moderate asthma: <LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1998</LINK> stated mild to moderate; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK> enrolled participants with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt; 80% predicted; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK> had participants with FEV1 &gt; 60% predicted. <LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK> included participants independent of the asthma severity.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1998</LINK>, the IMT group used a protocol with 30 breaths at 50% of PImax twice daily, whilst the control group trained with 60 breaths at around 20% PImax twice daily. The duration of the intervention was three weeks in both groups.</P>
<P>The intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK> trained three times a week over a period of six weeks: 10 minutes each session with resistance equal to 40% of their PImax obtained at a daily assessment. The control group received respiratory physiotherapy (especially bronchial hygiene techniques) based on clinical necessity. <LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK> also included a third intervention arm where participants received physical training in addition to IMT. This intervention was beyond the scope of our review.</P>
<P>Three studies had similar interventions which compared the IMT group to a sham training (control) group (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK>). Both groups trained once per day, six times a week, 30 minutes each session. The intervention group started breathing at loads equal to 15% of their PImax for one week. The load was then incrementally increased by 5% to10% at each session to reach 60% of their PImax at the end of the first month. The intervention was continued at 60% of PImax up to the end of the training period. Load level was adjusted every week according to the participant's new PImax level. Control group participants trained using the same training device but with no resistance. The duration of the intervention varied between studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK> trial both groups trained for a period of three months. The <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK> study had a 12 week intervention phase for the control group, and the intervention group continued with the training for as long as it took for the inspiratory muscle strength to increase by more than 20 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O over their baseline value (within 16 to 25 weeks). In <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK>, the endpoint of the training was designed to be when the mean inspiratory muscle strength of the women in the training group equalled that of the males with asthma (which took approximately 20 weeks).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:46:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>This systematic review sought to evaluate the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in people with asthma. For this update, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1992</LINK>) included in the last version was excluded and one additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK>) was incorporated in the review. Despite a careful review of the available literature, without language restrictions, only five randomised controlled trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. The number of included studies was low and number of participants (113) was also small, therefore the data for analyses were limited. Moreover, trial data were not always presented in suitable format for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We found that IMT significantly improved inspiratory muscle strength by a mean of 13 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, but the confidence intervals were wide. Becasue there is no established minimally important difference for PImax, we are uncertain if this improvement in PImax translates into any clinical benefit. In the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>), three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK>) with 76 participants showed improvement in PImax with IMT when compared to the control group (MD 23.07 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI 15.65 to 30.50, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 38%, P = 0.20). <LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK> included the <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1992</LINK> trial, which contributed a weight of 53% in the meta-analysis. However, this study was a double-blind comparative trial and because it was not randomised we excluded the study from this update to the systematic review. Non-randomised studies frequently yield larger estimates of effect, which may explain the difference in the magnitude of benefit reported in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Odgaard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgaard-Jensen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference between the IMT group and the control group for the outcomes of PEmax, PEFR, FEV1, FVC, sensation of dyspnoea and use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>Most trials predominantly included adult participants with mild or moderate asthma, therefore the results may not be generalised to children or people with more severe asthma. Furthermore, the findings are specific to the type of training performed. In all included studies the training was conducted through the threshold loading, using the POWERbreathe® or Threshold®IMT, and cannot be extended to flow resistive loading.</P>
<P>The small number of included studies together with the risk of bias make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effect of IMT.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:26:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies, including control characteristics (sham versus no intervention), training protocol (40% to 60% of PImax), duration of training sessions (10 to 30 minutes) and duration of the intervention (3 to 25 weeks). Furthermore, the aims of the studies varied from evaluating the relationship with the perception of dyspnoea, inspiratory muscle strength and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist consumption before and after IMT (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK>) to investigating the gender differences in inspiratory muscle strength on the perception of dyspnoea (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002</LINK> the training was designed to end when the inspiratory muscle strength of each participant increased by more than 20 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O over the baseline, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 2002a</LINK> the endpoint of the training was designed to be when the mean inspiratory muscle strength of the women in the training group equalled the strength of the men with asthma. This resulted in a variable duration of training and outcomes that were measured at many different time points, which may have impacted on the measured outcomes.</P>
<P>With respect to training intensity, it was not possible to identify which load was most effective. In people with COPD, a review has concluded that more research is needed to explore the impact that different training protocols (frequency, intensity and duration of IMT, supervision) may have on outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2008</LINK>). A more recent review observed no dose&#8211;response relationship for IMT in people with COPD, probably because the studies included in the meta-analysis were set at an inspiratory load of &#8805; 30% PImax (<LINK REF="REF-Gosselink-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosselink 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials included in this update was difficult to accurately ascertain. Study samples were small and the risk of bias was mostly unclear due to inadequate reporting. Allocation concealment was not described adequately in the studies. Studies in which the allocation concealment is inadequate yield larger estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>) and trials with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment have been show to exaggerate intervention effect estimates by approximately 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five of our nine pre-specified outcomes (56%) were addressed in the analysis. The <LINK REF="STD-McConnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McConnell 1998</LINK> trial provided the majority of data (four of five outcomes), but this study was at high risk of bias for sequence generation. Moreover, the remaining four trials were judged to be at unclear risk of bias for sequence generation. This bias may have overestimated our results. The intervention effect estimates can be exaggerated by an average of 11% in trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The GRADE evidence across the review was low or very low. More research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect for the outcomes investigated and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:26:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>Despite attempts to apply a systematic process in selecting studies for inclusion or exclusion in this update, the final decisions are subject to a level of interpretation. In order to minimise clinical heterogeneity we excluded the trial that had mixed interventions, inspiratory muscle training and breathing exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Lima-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lima 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some data that were said to be recorded in a few of the trials were not reported in sufficient detail to allow meta-analysis. We are uncertain what the impact of this was on the results and conclusions of the review. We tried to minimise possible biases by contacting the authors to verify study characteristics and to request data, but no reply was received.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:47:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>We found no previous non-Cochrane reviews addressing the efficacy of IMT for asthma. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2003</LINK>). Thus the search was amended and run again across all years up to 2012. We incorporated one new study (<LINK REF="STD-Sampaio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sampaio 2002</LINK>) and the latest Cochrane risk of bias tool. We excluded a study which was incorporated in the previous version of the review because the study was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1992</LINK>). Despite these differences, in both versions IMT significantly improved inspiratory muscle strength but it was not possible to state if this improvement in inspiratory muscle strength translates into any clinical benefit.</P>

<P>There is no conclusive evidence in this review to support or refute inspiratory muscle training for asthma. The evidence was limited by the small number of included randomised controlled trials, number of participants and the risk of bias. There was also clinical heterogeneity between the trials.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:47:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ivanizia S Silva">
<P>There are few studies available that evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training for asthma, thus more randomised controlled trials are needed to draw firm conclusions about the topic. The method utilized in the randomisation and also concealment of the allocation must be appropriate and clearly described by the authors. Blinding of outcome assessment and, when possible, of the participants must be both implemented and described. If losses occur, the analysis must be by intention to treat, and all the data must be described adequately so that they can be entered in a meta-analysis. The trials should investigate important outcomes including respiratory muscle strength, exacerbation rate, lung function, symptoms, hospital admissions, use of medications and days off work or school. IMT should also be assessed in the context of more severe asthma and conducted in children with asthma in order to be able to generalise the findings. Furthermore, attention must be paid to possible side effects that could appear during training. In particular, trial sample sizes should be determined before the start of such studies and the results should be reported following the CONSORT guidelines.</P>

Eighteen patients (mean FEV1.0 0.98 litre) who had completed an intensive treatment and rehabilitation programme were studied. Ten patients were trained for six weeks by inspiratory resistance breathing for 45-60 minutes per day. Eight used a placebo device. The two groups did not differ in terms of mean FEV1.0, vital capacity or exercise capacity. The trained patients increased their tolerance of inspiratory resistance breathing, although mean maximum inspiratory pressures (MIP) did not change. In neither the trained nor the control groups did clinically significant changes occur in the maximum work load, oxygen desaturation or ventilatory response with exercise. Of the two patients with the greatest increases in MIP after training, only one improved his exercise capacity. Hence, in patients with severe chronic airflow limitation, optimally treated, inspiratory muscle training did not further increase exercise performance.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-09-03 09:53:26 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
