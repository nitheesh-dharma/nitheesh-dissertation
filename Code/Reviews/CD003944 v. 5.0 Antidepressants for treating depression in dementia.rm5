<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-10-23 15:05:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">Insufficient evidence for the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for depression in dementia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Depression is common in people with dementia and many patients are prescribed antidepressants. Current evidence offers only weak support for this practice. However, this conclusion is based on a very small number of studies with small sample sizes, predominately investigating classes of antidepressants not routinely used in clinical practice. Perhaps the main value of this review is to draw attention to this issue. It is not that antidepressants are necessarily ineffective but rather that there is not much evidence to support their efficacy. Given that they may produce serious side-effects clinicians should therefore prescribe with due caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The use of antidepressants for patients with dementia accompanied by depressive symptoms is widespread, but their clinical efficacy is uncertain. Many of the individual trials of antidepressants have been too small to provide precise estimates of the moderate benefits that might realistically be expected. Combining the information from all appropriate trials may provide a better estimate of the likely effects of treatment.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether antidepressants are clinically effective and acceptable for the treatment of patients with depression and also dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The CDCIG Specialized Register was last searched on 27 April 2005. This register contains records from major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. Medical information departments of pharmaceutical companies were asked to search their databases for any relevant clinical trials. Where necessary authors of trials were approached with requests for additional information.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All relevant unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression, according to established criteria.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted data independently and settled any differences by agreement.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There were seven included studies with a total of 1140 subjects of which 769 met inclusion criteria. Four included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into meta-analyses, with a total of 137 subjects. Two of these studies investigated the properties of drugs not commonly used in this population with only two studies (Petracca 2001and Lyketsos 2003) using the more common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Lyketsos 2003 produced two significant differences in favour of treatment in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) at 12 weeks and in the psychiatrists' global rating. However, the CSDD was not used in any of the other studies and no statistical differences were found with the other measures used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the number of patients suffering at least one adverse event, one event of the nervous system, one event of the gastrointestinal system and one event of dry mouth at 6 to 12 weeks showed a significant difference in favour of placebo. There were no other significant results.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Available evidence offers weak support to the contention that antidepressants are effective for patients with depression and dementia. However, only four studies are included in the meta-analysis relating to efficacy, and sample sizes are small. Moreover, only two included studies investigated the properties of the more commonly used SSRIs and no studies investigated the properties of newer classes of antidepressants (e.g. selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors). This review draws attention to the paucity of research and evidence in this area.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 15:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>People with dementia are commonly afflicted with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loreck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loreck 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearlson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearlson 1990</LINK>) and it has been correlated with increased disability, impaired quality of life, and higher mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Rovner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 1989</LINK>). Dementia with depression is an important clinical problem that clinicians manage without the benefit of treatment guidelines; hence the need for this review of the available literature.</P>
<P>Depression and dementia are concepts with nebulous boundaries. Depressive illness has been conceptualized in dimensional and categorical terms with no consensus about its fundamental nature. When conceptualized dimensionally, depression's various presentations are explained by their position on a continuum of increasing severity. When conceptualized categorically, depressive illness is sub-grouped into discrete entities such as melancholic or non-melancholic depression and anxious depression (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2000</LINK>). Dementia is a syndrome that may arise from a variety of underlying pathologies, the most common of which are Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia.</P>
<P>Given the complex nature of both depression and dementia, understanding the relationship between the two is difficult. Depressive illness in older people can present as a 'pseudodementia' and be difficult to distinguish from a dementing illness (<LINK REF="REF-Raskind-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raskind 1998</LINK>). On the other hand, depression is often associated with deterioration in cognitive functioning which is sometimes not completely reversible with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Abas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abas 1990</LINK>). Moreover, in older people a history of depression in later life may be associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing a dementing illness (<LINK REF="REF-Butters-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butters 2000</LINK>). Both disorders are common in older people and may therefore be expected to occur together solely by chance.</P>
<P>Because of these complexities diagnosing depression in patients with dementia can be difficult. Denial and cognitive impairment may compromise self-report of depressive symptoms by people with dementia. As the dementing illness progresses, the presentation of depression may alter, with non-verbal manifestations (e.g. demanding behaviour, clinging) being more apparent than cognitive features (<LINK REF="REF-Vida-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vida 1994</LINK>). Moreover, neurovegetative symptoms such as poor concentration and anhedonia are features of depression and dementia. Not surprisingly, there is no consensus on how best to diagnose depression in demented patients. Symptom depression scales may overestimate, whereas structured diagnostic interviews may underestimate the prevalence of depression in people with dementia. Given the complexity of the issues impinging on accurate diagnosis it is not surprising that estimates of the incidence and prevalence rates of depression in dementing patients vary between 0 and 86%. Larger studies using standardized criteria for major depressive disorder in Alzheimer's disease provide estimates of prevalence at 10 to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Loreck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loreck 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of antidepressants for patients with dementia accompanied by depressive symptoms is widespread, but their clinical efficacy is uncertain. This uncertainty is due to the difficulties of interpreting the results of clinical trials. Many of the individual trials of antidepressants have been too small to provide precise estimates of the moderate benefits that might realistically be expected. Combining the information from all appropriate trials may provide a better estimate of the likely effects of treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of any type of antidepressants for patients who have been diagnosed as having dementia of any type and depression as defined by recognised criteria.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All identified relevant unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of longer than 4 weeks were considered. Trials in which the allocation to treatment or placebo was not random, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed were excluded as prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased patient allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>). If trials used a cross-over design, only data gathered in the first period were used, in order to avoid carry-over effects.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">STUDY SELECTION</HEADING>
<P>A single reviewer (JB) discarded irrelevant citations identified by searches, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. If there was any suggestion that an article could be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. The reviewers (JB and JSB) then independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ASSESSMENT OF METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY</HEADING>
<P>The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Only trials in which the randomization fell into category A or B of the handbook were included. Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by a scoring system although details of blinding, whether data for intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up were noted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">DATA EXTRACTION</HEADING>
<P>Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (JB, JSB) and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and adjudicated by a third reviewer (TD). Data were sought on every patient for each outcome measure. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up.</P>
<P>If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed, or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested that parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data. Where the outcome measure was a continuous variable or ordinal variable (such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, functional and quality of life scales) summary statistics, including means, standard deviations and number in each treatment group, were extracted for the final assessment score (corrected for baseline) and the change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or randomization) to the final assessment for each study. For binary outcomes, the statistics extracted from each study were the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers in each endpoint category for each treatment group. Where dichotomous data were missing, the patients were assumed to have suffered the least favourable outcome. In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment period were included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">DATA ANALYSIS</HEADING>
<P>We envisaged that the participants, interventions and outcomes in each of the included trials would be sufficiently similar to make combining trials clinically meaningful. As individual trials identified in this field tend to be small, we combined all dementia subtypes and all types of antidepressants to perform a meta-analysis. This increases statistical power, and assumes that the combining of studies is clinically as well as statistically valid.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>A test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials was made using a standard chi-square statistic. If a test of heterogeneity was negative then a fixed effects model was used. If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials, then either only homogeneous results were pooled, or a random effects model was used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed effects model).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Choice of summary statistic</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcome data, we calculated the odds ratio for each trial, and then a pooled odds ratio across appropriate groups of trials (using Mantel-Haenszel methods). For continuous variables, the weighted mean difference between treatment and control was calculated when each study in the meta-analysis used the same outcome measure, or the standardized mean difference when the study used a variety of outcome measures.</P>

<BR/>All seven studies stated that the participants met DSM criteria for dementia or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease.<BR/>The mean age of participants who met inclusion criteria in the studies was between 71and 80 years with an overall mean of 75 years.<BR/>The severity of dementia in the seven studies varied. The mean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score prior to treatment in those subjects who met inclusion criteria for the review was between 15.4 to 23.2 (mean score 19.1). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nyth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nyth 1992</LINK>) used another measure of cognitive function, and the data were not convertible into an MMSE score.</P>
<P>Six studies stated that the participants met DSM criteria for major depression with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Petracca-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Petracca 2001</LINK>) stating subjects met DSM criteria for either major or minor depression.

<P>All seven studies used different antidepressants, three studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or related compounds, three used an SSRI and one used a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

<P>All seven studies said they were double-blind but none reported checking on this. The nature of the placebos was not stated in three of the studies, in three it was described as 'identical' in appearance, and in the other as 'matched'. It is presumed that the placebos were inert. Six studies reported completer's data with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK>) reporting intention-to-treat data.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>See: List of comparisons and Tables of other data<BR/> <BR/>There were seven included studies with a total of 1140. Of these subjects 769 met inclusion criteria for the review. <LINK REF="STD-Nyth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nyth 1992</LINK> did not report separately the results for the group with dementia. Therefore six studies with a total of 740 subjects reported results in sufficient detail to include in the meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1996</LINK> published results for the completers but did not include the numbers in each treatment group who had completed and its results had to be<I> </I>limited to adverse events data, as did the data from <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1993</LINK>. The meta-analysis concerning efficacy was therefore limited to four studies with a total of 137 subjects. Of these four studies, two (<LINK REF="STD-Petracca-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petracca 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reifler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reifler 1989</LINK>) investigated the properties of TCAs, drugs not commonly used in this population, and only two studies investigated the properties of the more commonly used SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petracca-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Petracca 2001</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK> study produced two significant differences in favour of treatment in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) at 12 weeks (WMD -6.70, 95% CI -11.50, -1.90) and in the psychiatrist's global rating (Peto odds ratio (OR) (95% Fixed) 7.33 (2.20, 24.46)). However, the CSDD was not used in any of the other included studies, and no statistical differences were found with the other measures used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the number of patients suffering at least one adverse event at 6 to 12 weeks, using the Peto odds ratio, showed a significant difference in favour of placebo (Peto OR (95% Fixed) 1.42 (1.07, 1.89)). There was a significant statistical difference in favour of placebo (using the Peto odds ratio) in subjects experiencing at least one nervous system adverse event (Peto OR (95% Fixed) 9.36 (2.23, 39.34)), subjects experiencing at least one gastrointestinal system adverse event (Peto OR (95% Fixed) 2.84 (1.12, 7.22)) and subjects experiencing dry mouth (Peto OR (95% Fixed) 1.68 (1.07, 2.62)). There were no statistical differences found in adverse events affecting other body systems or particular symptoms (e.g. dizziness, constipation). No statistical differences were found in measures of cognitive function (e.g. the MMSE).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The process of combining data from differing studies is problematic. The assumption is that the study samples are drawn from similar populations but the validity of this assumption is difficult to assess. The adherence to the inclusion criteria for studies ensures some homogeneity with all subjects included in the review meeting recognised criteria for both depression and dementia.</P>
<P>The trials included in the review used antidepressants from a variety of classes with different mechanisms of action. These classes may vary in their efficacy or safety in the depression of dementia, or may be preferentially effective in particular sub-types of dementia. However, given the small number of trials and the similar generally reported efficacy of the various classes of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>), analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of various classes of antidepressants was not attempted. Similarly, there was no examination of the efficacy of antidepressants on different subtypes of dementia or on patients with different degrees of dementia, nor did we examine the correlation of antidepressant dose with effect. <BR/>
<BR/>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are associated with side-effects that are potentially more problematic for elderly patients. In particular their anticholinergic properties are associated with a negative impact on cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Settle-Jr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Settle Jr 1998</LINK>), involving postural hypotension and risk of falls (<LINK REF="REF-Glassman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glassman 1981</LINK>). The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a different range of side-effects; importantly they have less marked anticholinergic properties and therefore may be less likely to cause confusion or falls (<LINK REF="REF-Avorn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avorn 1998</LINK>). For this reason it is the SSRIs that are most often used for older people and for treating depression in dementia. Two of the four studies used in the meta-analysis of efficacy data (<LINK REF="STD-Petracca-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petracca 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reifler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reifler 1989</LINK>) investigated the properties of tricyclic antidepressants. This is potentially problematic as TCAs are not commonly used to treat patients with depression and co-existing dementia, and none of the studies investigated the properties of the newer classes of antidepressants that are being increasingly used in this population.<BR/> <BR/>As discussed earlier, the relationship between depression and dementia is complex, and depression is more difficult to diagnose in patients with dementia. DSM criteria for depression include anhedonia and poor concentration, both symptoms of dementia. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK>) attempted to take this potentially confounding factor into account when making the diagnosis of depression. A further concern is that only one of the depression rating scales used in the included studies was developed for the specific purpose of measuring depression in dementia (CSDD). Other instruments used in the included studies were developed in younger subjects and may underestimate depression in older patients because of the atypical nature of depression in the elderly (Hamilton Depression Scale). Even where scales are designed specifically for the elderly population they may not be reliable in the specific scenario of depression in dementia (e.g. the Geriatric Depression Scale) (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The meta-analysis produced only two statistically significant results. There was a significant difference in favour of treatment compared with placebo in the CSDD at 12 weeks and in the psychiatrists' global rating. However, both of these results originate from a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK>) with a small sample size (n = 44). These results must be seen in the context of non-significant findings with respect to the other measures administered and it must be noted that only one of four studies included in the efficacy meta-analysis used the CSDD (<LINK REF="STD-Lyketsos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lyketsos 2003</LINK>). The meta-analysis of the number of patients suffering at least one adverse event at 6 to 12 weeks showed a significant difference in favour of placebo. There were no statistical differences in measures of cognitive function (e.g. the MMSE). It is unfortunate that the results of the three of the seven studies included in the review could not be included in the efficacy meta-analysis for the reasons stated earlier. The authors of the studies were contacted and statistical elaboration requested, but for various reasons elaboration did not prove possible. This is of particular regret with regards to the <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1996</LINK> study as it was a large multi-centre study with 476 subjects meeting inclusion criteria for the review and the authors reported positive results. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although depression is common in people with dementia and many patients are prescribed antidepressants, the evidence to support this practice is weak. However, this conclusion is based on a very small number of studies with small sample sizes, predominately investigating classes of antidepressants not routinely used in clinical practice. Perhaps the main value of this review is to draw attention to this issue. It is not that antidepressants are necessarily ineffective but rather that there is not much evidence to support their efficacy. Given that they may produce serious side-effects clinicians should therefore prescribe with due caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With an expanding ageing population and therefore an increase in the prevalence of dementia, more research is needed in this important clinical area. There is a need for good randomized controlled trials of modern, frequently used drugs. There is a trend to use depression scales that have been developed in young adult populations and then apply them to older populations with dementia, with the assumption that they remain valid instruments. This is clearly problematic and may result in negative findings. There is therefore a need for future research to use scales validated in elderly subjects with depression and dementia (such as the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia).</P>

<P>The principal outcome measure was response to treatment, rated by 2 study psychiatrists (PVR or MS), who reviewed patients scores on baseline and follow-up depression rating scales after the study was completed. Rated each patient on 3 point global scale as a non-responder, partial responder or full responder. These psychiatrists were blind to medication or placebo and did not personally manage any patient in the study. No algorithm was used, instead they used their best clinical judgement. If there were any disagreements, the 2 raters met to provide a mutually agreeable rating.<BR/>Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CS)<BR/>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale<BR/>Activities of daily living subscale of the Psychogeriatric Dependency Rating Scales<BR/>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)<BR/>MMSE<BR/>

<P>Good well designed study. Attempted to address the diagnostic difficulties eg<BR/>to address possible overlap of symptoms af Alzheimer's disease and major depression, if DSM-IV criterion 2 were to count toward the diagnosis of depression of major depressive episode it had to be clearly because of loss of pleasure (anhedonia) and not entirely because of loss of interest. Similarly, DSM criterion 8 had to attributed to indecisiveness and not entirely due to difficulty concentrating.</P>
