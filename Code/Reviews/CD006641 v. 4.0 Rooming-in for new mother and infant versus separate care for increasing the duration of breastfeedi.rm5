<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Keeping mother and infant together (rooming-in) or separating them after birth are both traditional practices seen in many cultures. During the early 20th century when hospitals became the centre for birthing in industrialised countries, the practice of separate care became established. Newborns were placed in a nursery separated from their mothers and brought to their mother only for breastfeeding. The practice of mother-infant rooming-in became less practised. Mother-infant proximity during the early postpartum period might directly influence mother-infant interaction, which might impact on the duration of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Separating infants from their mothers after birth may reduce the frequency of breastfeeding and hence the amount of breast milk a mother produces. Whereas, infants staying together with the mother throughout their hospital stay would have more frequent suckling of the breast and thus promote closeness and bonding. Separate care might allow the mother to rest and reduce stress, which also might improve milk production. Many hospitals have now started to keep the mother and baby in the same room, particularly since the advent of the WHO/UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative in 1991. This systematic review aimed to establish from randomised controlled trials whether rooming-in or separate care after birth resulted in a longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding once they had returned home.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>The latest search was done on 30th May 2016. No new studies were identified. Only one study is included in the review.</P>
<P>One trial (involving 176 women) was analysed which provided information on the rate of exclusive breastfeeding on discharge from hospital. We found that there was <I>low-quality evidence </I>that keeping mother and infant together in the same room after birth until they are discharged from the hospital increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at four days after birth. There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>We found little evidence to support or refute the practice of rooming-in after birth. A randomised controlled trial is needed and it should report all important outcomes, including breastfeeding duration.</P>

<P>Mother-infant proximity and interactions after birth and during the early postpartum period are important for breast-milk production and breastfeeding success. Rooming-in and separate care are both traditional practices. Rooming-in involves keeping the mother and the baby together in the same room after birth for the duration of hospitalisation, whereas separate care is keeping the baby in the hospital nursery and the baby is either brought to the mother for breastfeeding or she walks to the nursery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:56:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included one trial (involving 176 women) in this review. This trial included four groups with a factorial design. The factorial design took into account two factors, i.e. infant location in relation to the mother and the type of infant apparel. We combined three of the groups as the intervention (rooming-in) group and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair-wise comparison.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome, <B>duration of any breastfeeding</B>, was reported by authors as median values because the distribution was found to be skewed. They reported the overall median duration of any breastfeeding to be four months, with no difference found between groups. <B>Duration of exclusive breastfeeding</B> and the <B>proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six months of age</B> was not reported in the trial. There was no difference found between the two groups in the <B>proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age </B>(risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.39; one trial; 137 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>

<P>The mean <B>frequency of breastfeeds per day</B> on day four postpartum for the rooming-in group was 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher than the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day. However, between-group comparison of this outcome was not appropriate since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison. <B>The rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum</B> before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming-in group 86% (99 of 115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17 of 38), (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:34:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Keeping a mother and her baby together in the same room or separating them after birth are both traditional practices. However, in the early part of 20th century, when hospitals became the predominant sites for birth in industrialised countries, separation of mothers and babies became widely practised. Newborns were cared for in hospital nurseries and mothers in postnatal wards. Babies were brought to their mothers for feeding, but otherwise remained in the hospital nursery until discharge. More recently some hospitals have begun the practise of keeping the mother and infant together in the same room to promote breastfeeding. Mother-infant proximity during the early postpartum period may influence mother-infant behaviour that is essential in regulation of breast-milk production and milk supply and hence it might make a difference to whether a mother successfully breastfeeds (<LINK REF="REF-Bramson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bigelow-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigelow 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:46:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Keeping mother and infant together has been termed rooming-in. It is defined by World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), as the hospital practice where postnatal mothers with normal infants (including those born by caesarean section) stay together in the same room 24 hours a day, from the time they arrive in their room after delivery. They remain together until discharge unless there is a specific medical indication which warrants separation. During rooming-in the infant is placed close to the mother either by bed-sharing, an attached side-car crib or by her bedside in a stand-alone cot.</P>
<P>Separating the infant from the mother in the hospital nursery after birth allows the mother to sleep and rest. While she is recuperating, she can either walk to the nursery whenever she feels ready, as frequently as she wishes or she can request the infant to be brought to her room for demand breastfeeding. Alternatively, all babies are brought from the nursery to their mothers at fixed intervals usually of about three or four hours (<LINK REF="REF-Hiller-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiller 2006</LINK>). In order to maintain optimal breast-milk production, the mother may continue to stimulate her breasts in between breastfeeds by either milking the breasts by hand massage or using the mechanical pump to emulate the infant's suckling (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1996</LINK>). Separate care may also be partial, for example it could be practised during the night with rooming-in during the day or rooming-in during the hospitalisation and separate care at home after discharge or vice versa.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-25 12:04:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Placing the infant in close proximity to the mother enables the mother to respond in a timely way whenever her infant shows signs of readiness to feed. Uninhibited mother-infant interaction and close contact promotes bonding, encourages demand breastfeeding and results in more efficient infant suckling, all essential in the regulation of breast-milk secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Bigelow-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigelow 2014</LINK>). Observational studies suggest that rooming-in is associated with higher a breastfeeding frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Yamauchi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamauchi 1990</LINK>), a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Buranasin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buranasin 1991</LINK>) and a longer duration of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, mothers who remain together with their infants reported more self-confidence and felt more competent in caring for their infants (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1980</LINK>), and were more likely to continue to breastfeed their infants longer than those mothers who had their infants separated. Apart from the positive effects on breastfeeding, rooming-in mothers may have a lower incidence of breast engorgement and milk stasis (<LINK REF="REF-Wilde-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 1999</LINK>) due to frequent breast-suckling by the infant and better infant weight gain due to less energy consumption from crying during early infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Yamauchi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamauchi 1990</LINK>). Rooming-in may also be advantageous to infant's health as it is associated with lower incidence of neonatal diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Mustajab-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mustajab 1986</LINK>) and significant hyperbilirubinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Suradi--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suradi 1998</LINK>) when compared to the infants in nursery care.</P>
<P>On the other hand, separate care might be harmful because the process of breast-milk production begins immediately after parturition with secretion of copious breast milk in the first 24 to 36 hours, progressing to mature breast milk by 72 hours postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Neville-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neville 2001</LINK>). The regulation of breast-milk production during this period is controlled by multiple factors including the maternal physical and psychological condition, the frequency of breastfeeding and effective infant suckling (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neville-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neville 1988</LINK>). Previous research has demonstrated that higher breastfeeding frequency during the early days of the puerperium contributes to optimal milk production (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1993</LINK>), higher milk volume (<LINK REF="REF-Wilde-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 1995</LINK>), and an adequate milk supply for a longer period (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2005</LINK>) and thus, likely to result in an increase in the duration of breastfeeding. On the contrary, lack or delay in breast stimulation in the first few days after delivery may result in sub-optimal breast-milk production, low milk supply and early cessation of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bigelow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigelow 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neville-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neville 1988</LINK> ). In addition, breast milk expression when compared to direct breastfeeding is associated with a higher risk of mastitis (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2005</LINK>). One study suggested that mother-infant separation in the early days of puerperium negatively affects the breast-milk production and reduces the duration of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Elander-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elander 1984</LINK>), but there are other studies that show maternal intention and interest in breastfeeding is the most important determining factor that influences the success of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a perceived security concern for infants when other patients and visitors have access to them, especially in hospitals with open maternity wards. In the hospital nursery, there is tighter security as access to the infants is strictly limited to mothers and midwives and in some hospitals even mothers are not allowed into the nursery. One of the reasons for the practice of separate care was the belief that it would protect babies from infection. However, serious outbreaks of nursery infection were reported leading to a proposal that keeping the mother and baby together might prevent infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hiller-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiller 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Labour is a stressful event for both the mother and infant. Most mothers, especially primigravidas and mothers who have had caesarean birth or prolonged and complicated labour, require adequate rest after childbirth in order to recover physically and psychologically. Increased levels of stress hormones during childbirth have been shown to affect the onset of breast-milk production leading to early breastfeeding failure (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1998</LINK>), and this could be potentially reduced by separate care.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-10 15:24:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The duration of exclusive breastfeeding globally remains low, with only an estimated 35% of infants being exclusively breastfed up to four months of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>), despite the benefits of breastfeeding for six months being well-established (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victora-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 1987</LINK>). Among the factors in the early puerperium that contribute to failure to sustain lactation for a longer duration include the mother's condition after labour, psychological stress (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1998</LINK>), mode of delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Suradi--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suradi 1998</LINK>), individual cultural practice (<LINK REF="REF-Ingram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingram 2003</LINK>) and, most importantly, the maternal desire to breastfeed her infant.</P>
<P>Mother-infant rooming-in is recommended by WHO/UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative 1991 in the <I>10 steps to successful breastfeeding</I>. It is believed to be the most favourable arrangement for optimal breast-milk production (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Although both separate care and rooming-in are traditional practices, the benefits and harms have not been fully evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this review is to assess the effects of the practice of routine mother-infant rooming-in compared with the practice of routine separation of mothers and babies on the duration of breastfeeding.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison.</P>

<LI>Duration of any breastfeeding</LI>
<LI>Proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six month of age</LI>
<LI>Proportion of infants being given any breastfeeding at six months of age</LI>

<LI>Exclusive breastfeeding on discharge from the hospital or day four postpartum.</LI>
<LI>Maternal level of confidence in breastfeeding</LI>
<LI>Neonatal infection</LI>

<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes were produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this update. In future updates, if eligible for inclusion, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials if such trials are identified and are otherwise eligible. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful.

<P>For the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jaafar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaafar 2012</LINK>), the search identified 24 reports of 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included one study (four reports) (<LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial met our inclusion criteria. This study was reported as a thesis and in four study reports. Two of these reports contributed data for analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK>: The study was a 4 x 2 factorial design involving a total of 176 mothers who were randomly assigned to the four main treatment groups. The four treatment groups were 1) skin-to-skin contact at birth with rooming-in, 2) no skin-to-skin contact with rooming-in, 3) no skin-to-skin contact with 24 hours nursery care, and 4) no skin-to-skin contact with rooming-in delayed up to three hours after birth. The overall aim of the study was to explore the role of closeness versus separation on infant and maternal outcomes, including breastfeeding outcomes. Breastfeeding outcomes on day four postpartum were reported in one of the reports. The authors reported the overall duration of 'nearly exclusive' breastfeeding as a median. In this review, we included the reported 'nearly exclusive' breastfeeding outcome as our pre-specified outcome 'any breastfeeding'. Data for nearly exclusive breastfeeding at six months was provided by the author. We reported this as one of our primary outcome of 'any breastfeeding'.</P>
<P>Three reports from <LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK> reported the effect of maternity home practices on breastfeeding performance with special reference to the type of infant apparel and the long-term effect of early contact versus separation. The most recent study report identified for this 2016 update reported on mother-infant interactions at day four postpartum by video analysis lasting 25 to 45 minutes. Videos were analysed for their visual content using a validated assessment tool <I>(Assessment tool for the observation of mother/infant interaction</I>, (unpublished)) to evaluate the quality of four variables measuring aspects of mother-infant interactions, each on a scale of one to five. Video data were available for analysis only for 151 mother-infant dyads. Some of these observations might indirectly measure maternal confidence. However, there were no analysable data; only P values were reported.</P>

<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK>, we judged the risk of selection bias to be low as they used a table to generate a random sequence and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes to achieve allocation concealment.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:43:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A total of 23 (13%) mothers were excluded from the in-hospital analysis and the reasons for exclusion were similar across the four groups. However a total of five out of 44 (11%) dropped out after allocation because they did not want to be allocated to nursery care, and six out of 115 (5%) because they did not want rooming-in. We judged there to be an imbalance between the groups for the reasons of attrition. There were no significant differences between the 23 mothers who were excluded and the 153 mothers who participated in the study with respect to education or the other background variables. Data were available for 78% of mothers at six-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat principle was used for those women who remained in the study.</P>
</EXCLUSIONS>
<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:43:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We judged this to be unclear because in the methods section of the thesis it was stated that breastfeeding duration was up to 12 months, however the results were not reported in any of the study publications, whereas other outcomes not relevant to this review were reported up to 12 months. Three- and six-month data were provided on request.</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:43:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>One-third of the women in the rooming-in group were allocated to skin-to-skin contact and one-third were able to hold their fully-clothed infant in the labour ward after birth, whereas one-third of the rooming-in group and all of the separate care group did not have any contact with their infant in the labour ward. These factors could independently influence breastfeeding outcomes, apart from any intervention effect, and so we judged this to be high risk for other biases.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison: Rooming-in versus separate mother and infant care after birth</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only one randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK>), involving 176 women, contributed data to the outcomes of interest, i.e. duration of any breastfeeding, frequency of breastfeeding per day and the rate of infants exclusively breastfed on discharge from the hospital. However, the trial did not report the duration of exclusive breastfeeding; the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed up to six months of age; or any of the maternal or neonatal outcomes pre-specified in our protocol.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration of any breastfeeding</HEADING>
<P>The overall median duration of any breastfeeding was reported to be four months. The authors stated that there was no significant difference between the groups. These data were reported as median because the distribution was skewed and so we could not include the data in any analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Proportion of infants being given any breastfeeding at six months of age (not pre-specified)</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between the rooming-in (36/105) and separate care (13/32) in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.39; one trial; 137 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Brystrova trial reported the mean frequency of breastfeeds per day on day four postpartum for the rooming-in group as 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher that the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day. However, analysis of this outcome was not done since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exclusive breastfeeding at day four postpartum</HEADING>
<P>The rate of infants exclusively breastfed on day four postpartum before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming-in group 86% (99/115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17/38) (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>We did not have sufficient data to perform any of our pre-specified subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>However, one-third of the women in the rooming-in group were allocated to skin-to- skin contact and one-third were able to hold their fully clothed infant in the labour ward after birth, whereas one-third of the rooming-in group and all of the separate care group did not have any contact with their infant in the labour ward. These factors could independently influence breastfeeding outcomes, apart from any intervention effect, and so we judged this to be high risk for other biases.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:44:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) (involving 176 mother-infant dyads) which took place in one maternity home in St Petersburg, Russia for inclusion in the review. Analysis from the available data showed mother-infant rooming-in significantly increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge (day four postpartum). However, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion on the effect of this on breastfeeding duration up to six months.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-20 09:30:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search for studies for inclusion in this review was very extensive and we believe that there is only one study that addresses our question. The included RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Bystrova-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bystrova 2008</LINK>) did not evaluate all the important pre-specified outcomes, in particular it did not evaluate the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed up to six months of age as recommended by the World Health Organization. The trial examined only healthy mother-infant pairs after a normal vaginal delivery and did not include healthy mother-infant pairs after operative delivery as we had intended to study. In addition, they did not report any of our pre-specified potentially harmful maternal and fetal outcomes such as rate of breast engorgement, maternal adverse events, neonatal infection, diarrhoea, and hypoglycaemia.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:44:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The quality of the evidence is severely limited by the inclusion of only one small study. We were unable to conduct GRADE quality assessments on five of our seven GRADE outcomes (duration of any breastfeeding; proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six month of age; frequency of breastfeeding per day; maternal level of confidence in breastfeeding; neonatal infection). The study reported nearly exclusive breastfeeding at six months. We judged this to be similar enough to our outcome, any breastfeeding. The authors stated that exclusive breastfeeding was rare in their setting. Nearly exclusive breastfeeding was defined as breastfeeding plus irregular supplementation of juices and solids less than 30 mL per day and formula less than 100 mL per day. We assessed the two outcomes proportion of women with any breastfeeding at six months (nearly exclusive breastfeeding) and exclusive breastfeeding at day four postpartum as being of l<I>ow-quality evidence</I>. We downgraded both outcomes to low quality because the evidence was derived only from this one small study, and secondly for risk of bias. We judged the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and for other biases arising from differences in labour ward management between the groups. These differences could have had an independent effect on our pre-specified outcomes. However, we conducted a posthoc subgroup analysis to explore the impact of the differences in labour ward management. We found no differences between the three rooming-in groups subgroups.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-09 11:44:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We attempted to minimise bias during the review process by having two people assess the eligibility of studies, assess risk of bias and extract data with a third person involved to check or review each area. We attempted to be as inclusive as possible in our search. We introduced the outcome proportion of infants being fed any breastfeeding at six months for this update. This is a post hoc decision which we made after we had completed our search and the decision is partly based on the outcomes reported in the included trial but also based om outcomes reported in the other Cochrane reviews reporting duration of breastfeeding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-09 10:22:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a need for a properly designed randomised controlled trial in this field to support or refute the practice of mother-infant rooming-in after delivery for increasing duration of breastfeeding. Proper randomisation including concealed allocation and blinding of outcome assessors, and complete or near complete follow-up are crucial. The intervention should be rooming-in for the entire duration of hospital stay as defined by the World Health Organization and outcome measures should include duration of exclusive breastfeeding and proportion of infants with exclusive or any breastfeeding to six months as well as the other secondary outcomes in this review. Consideration should be given to standardising the placement of the cot for the rooming-in mother-infant pair. In addition to a randomised controlled trial, it would be important to explore the process of rooming-in, using qualitative methods. This would provide insight into social and environmental factors that may support or hinder this practice.</P>

<P>The methods have been updated in accordance with the latest guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and standard methods text for Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth review group.</P>
<P>For this update (2016), we have reversed the intervention and the comparison. We have taken rooming-in as our intervention and separate care as the comparison. Since both rooming-in and separate care are traditional practices we have made this change because we felt that rooming-in was the intervention of interest and it was more intuitive for the reader. We added the outcome, Proportion of infants being given any breastfeeding at six months of age. We also conducted a posthoc subgroup analysis to explore the impact of the differences in labour ward management of the three rooming-in groups.</P>

<P>Primary breastfeeding outcomes: breastfeeding parameters on day 4 postpartum, i.e. frequency of breastfeeding per day, duration of each feed (minutes), volume of milk ingested (mL), infant weight changes (g) and rate of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes: median duration of 'nearly exclusive' breastfeeding, and mother-infant interaction 1 year later using The Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA) Method.</P>
<P>'Nearly exclusive' breastfeeding is analysed as any breastfeeding in this review.</P>
<P>The paper included in this update used a validated tool with 14 observations to assess mother-infant interaction at day 4. Some of the elements on this tool might be considered as indirect measures of maternal confidence.</P>

<P>This thesis was reported in a total of 5 study reports (only 2 study reports contributed data to this review). Due to skewing of the data the duration of breastfeeding was analysed as a median and interquartile range. The mean and SD was supplied by the author who warned a skewed distribution of data. The author also supplied 'nearly exclusive breastfeeding' outcomes at 6 months.</P>

<P>This 'randomised' trial examined the effect of rooming-in on the incidence of measures of parenting inadequacy. A total of 301 mother-infant pairs were studied. The randomisation and allocation was based on the availability of the rooming-in beds in the postnatal ward. When both type beds were available, there was no information about how mothers were assigned to the postnatal beds. About 143 mothers were assigned by the bed availability to rooming-in (n = 143), where the infants were roomed-in with their mothers 7 hours after birth up to 8 hours each day until discharge. The other 158 mother-infant pairs had separate care after a glimpse of their baby at birth. Parental inadequacy was measured after 17 months by the rate of infestations, rate of accident, exanthematous disease and hospitalisation. Rooming-in in this study did not meet our definition of rooming-in where the infants are expected to stay with mother in the same room or in nursery for 24 hours a day.</P>

The number of exclusions and reasons for exclusion were similar across the 4 groups.

<P>Women in the rooming-in group had 1 of 3 different treatments in the labour ward i.e. skin-to-skin contact, holding dressed baby in her arms immediately after delivery and removal of the baby form the mother during stay in the labour ward. These treatments could have independently influenced the outcome so that any effect seen in the rooming-in group might not be attributable to the rooming-in intervention.</P>
