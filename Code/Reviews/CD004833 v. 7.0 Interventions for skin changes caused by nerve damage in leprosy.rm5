<TITLE>Interventions for skin changes caused by nerve damage in leprosy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 08:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Three million persons are affected by nerve damage caused by leprosy (Hansen's disease) worldwide. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium <I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>. About 30% of people with leprosy develop nerve damage that can lead to loss of normal sensation and skin damage. The skin can crack and become infected and ulcerated. Impairment of the affected limb, caused by nerve damage, can result in severe joint deformity and injuries. The major areas affected by sensory loss are the hands (especially the palms), feet (especially the soles) and eyes. The drug therapy offered to those with leprosy is efficacious and has low relapse rates. However, even with treatment, many with leprosy will go on to develop secondary damage to skin and limbs as the nerve damage sustained cannot be reversed. In some, treatment leads to inflammatory reactions in the nerves, sometimes resulting in further damage.</P>
<P>Many interventions may help the healing of such ulcers. The rationale behind the use of, for example, appropriate footwear is to protect feet from damage that can lead to superficial sores on the soles of the feet, and later ulcers and secondary infections. Self-care includes daily management to reduce the effects of nerve function impairment. Education, information and empowerment of those affected by leprosy (and their carers) is part of some leprosy programmes and might prevent ulcers developing. Dressings might enhance the healing of ulcers.</P>
<P>We included eight trials with a total of 557 participants. Based on weak evidence we suggest that dressings with topical ketanserin may be more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste and topical phenytoin may be more effective than saline dressings regarding ulcer healing. Canvas shoes seem to be a little better than PVC-boots, but not significantly. Double rocker shoes do not show statistically significant benefit compared to below-knee plaster in promoting healing of ulcers. Whether the interventions reduce social stigma and lead to better quality of life were not investigated in any of the eight trials in this review. No side effects were documented.</P>
<P>There is a lack of high quality research in the field of ulcer prevention and treatment in leprosy. New trials should follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>More than three million persons are disabled by leprosy worldwide. The main complication of sensory nerve damage is neuropathic ulceration, particularly of the feet. In this review we explored interventions that can prevent and treat secondary damage to skin and limbs.</P>

<P>Eight trials with a total of 557 participants were included. The quality of the trials was generally poor. The interventions and outcome measures were diverse. Although three studies that compared zinc tape to more traditional dressings found some benefit, none of these showed a statistically significant effect. One trial indicated that topical ketanserin had a better effect on wound healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste, RR was 6.00 (95% CI 1.45 to 24.75). We did not combine the results of the two studies that compared topical phenytoin to saline dressing, but both studies found statistically significant effects in favour of phenytoin for healing of ulcer (SMD -2.34; 95% CI -3.30 to -1.39; and SMD -0.79; 95% CI -1.20 to 0.39). Canvas shoes were not much better than PVC-boots, and double rocker shoes did not promote healing much more than below-knee plasters.</P>

<P>One study suggested that topical ketanserin is more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-09 09:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>More than three million individuals are currently disabled by leprosy (Hansen's disease) worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Despite intensive efforts to control the disease, the total incidence is reported to be about 700,000 new cases per year (738,00 and 634,376 new cases detected in 1999 and 2000 respectively), in affected countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002b</LINK>). The proportion of new cases of leprosy in children under 15 years of age was 18% in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Hence person-to-person transmission remains a problem; there are significant numbers of childhood cases and many people suffer from the consequences of leprosy (<LINK REF="REF-McDougall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDougall 2002</LINK>). At the beginning of 2003 the number of people currently on drug treatment for leprosy was around 524,000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). There were 407,791 new cases diagnosed and reported to WHO in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006b</LINK>). Although the incidence rate is declining slowly worldwide it is rising in a few places ( <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>South East Asia has the highest prevalence of leprosy followed by the Americas, Africa, the Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). The seven most affected countries are India, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Nepal, Madagascar and Mozambique. Of all those identified as having the disease, 64% live in India .</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium <I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical manifestations and complications</HEADING>
<P>The principal manifestations are skin lesions (flat or raised patches on the skin, sometimes a few and sometimes numerous, depending on host immunity). In those with a large number of bacteria the skin may become diffusely thickened. Thickened or cracked skin, or skin ulcers, may be later complications and peripheral neuropathy, (inflammation of nerves in the limbs, which become thickened and damaged) is common. Complications result from nerve damage, through immune reactions and also through direct invasion by the <I>M. leprae</I> bacteria. When the small sensory and autonomic nerve fibres in the skin are damaged this initially causes local loss of sensation and loss of the skin's ability to sweat. Damage to peripheral nerves eventually leads to more widespread loss of sensation, skin dryness and reduced function of the muscles supplied by the affected nerve. The dry skin can crack and become infected and ulcerated, and misuse of the affected limb can ultimately result in severe joint deformity and injuries.</P>
<P>The major areas affected by nerve damage in leprosy are the hands (especially the palms), feet (especially the soles) and eyes. The main complication of sensory nerve damage is ulceration secondary to sensory loss, particularly of the feet. The drug therapy offered to people infected with <I>M. leprae</I> is efficacious if given for sufficient length of time (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). However, even with treatment, many persons with leprosy will go on to develop secondary damage to skin and limbs as the nerve damage sustained cannot be reversed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Leprosy is diagnosed clinically by two principal signs:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>anaesthetic skin lesions i.e. parts of the skin that are numb and not able to detect painful stimuli such as a pin prick;</LI>
<LI>thickened peripheral nerves that can easily be felt through the skin;</LI>
</UL>
<P>and by:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>positive smear i.e. evidence of the causative bacterium, <I>M. leprae,</I> using microscopic examination of a sample of tissue (skin smear).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Classification</HEADING>
<P>There are two main forms of classification (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2002a</LINK>). They are the Ridley-Jopling scheme and the World Health Organization (WHO) PB/MB (paucibacillary/multi bacillary) classification .</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ridley-Jopling scheme</HEADING>
<P>This classifies leprosy on a scale from 'tuberculoid' to 'lepromatous' based on the clinical appearance and bacterial index of lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2002a</LINK>). 'Tuberculoid' indicates that the body's immunity is good and there are few skin lesions. 'Lepromatous' means that the body has a poor immune response to the mycobacteria and there is uncontrolled bacterial multiplication, many skin lesions and also lesions in the mucosa of the nose and mouth. Peripheral nerve damage can occur at any point on the scale. Between the extremes of ' tuberculoid' and 'lepromatous' are the 'unstable borderline tuberculoid' and 'borderline lepromatous' forms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">WHO classification</HEADING>
<P>This classification is based on the number of skin lesions:<BR/>1. paucibacillary (PB) - up to five lesions<BR/>2. multi bacillary (MB) - greater than five lesions (and/or positive smear at any site).</P>
<P>This is a simple classification scheme that makes treatment simpler for field workers, but it is less specific than the Ridley-Jopling scheme. The WHO classification system is the most widely used.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 14:20:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Chemotherapy with a combination of drugs (multidrug treatment (MDT)), is used to treat leprosy. The drugs used are rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine - they are effective in killing bacilli, but do not prevent further nerve damage. Virtually all people affected by leprosy, and registered with their local health services, are treated with MDT. Other interventions in leprosy care are aimed at prevention and treatment of secondary damage to skin and limbs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 08:23:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The rationale behind the use of, for example, appropriate footwear is to protect feet from damage that can lead to superficial sores on the soles of the feet, and later ulcers and secondary infections (<LINK REF="REF-McDougall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDougall 2002</LINK>). Many interventions may help the healing of such ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasan 1989</LINK>). Self-care includes daily management to reduce the effects of nerve function impairment. Education, information and empowerment of those affected by leprosy (and their carers) is part of some leprosy programmes (<LINK REF="REF-McDougall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDougall 2002</LINK>). Ketanserin is thought to decrease peripheral vascular resistance. This vasodilation might have beneficial effects on capillary haemodynamics and cause increase in the blood flow and enhance healing of ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>). Phenytoin is another topical dressing thought to enhance healing. The rationale behind this is that it accelerates the formation and maturation of collagen fibres, stimulates fibroblast proliferation, and inhibits collagenase activity (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Nerve damage can happen before, during and after chemotherapy treatment. It affects approximately 30% of people diagnosed with leprosy (2.6% with PB, 37% with MB, 2 years after detection and MDT treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2001</LINK>). Approximately 6% to 9% of people with newly diagnosed leprosy present with grade 2 disabilities (visible deformity or damage present) and as many as 20% to 56% of people have established nerve damage at diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2002b</LINK>). These figures vary from country to country and between disease types.</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-08 08:32:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The key to effective management of leprosy is early diagnosis and treatment, and early recognition and management of nerve damage, combined with effective health education to prevent limb damage. A successful treatment of the nerve damage itself can be effective for preventing ulcer development. Corticosteroids have been used for this purpose. However, a systematic review of three randomised controlled trials comparing prednisolone with placebo or comparing different doses of corticosteroids did not show a significant long-term effect (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Veen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Veen 2007</LINK>). Also, corticosteroids are not well tolerated by everybody and may cause harmful effects. It is, therefore, still of importance to find the best way of prevention or treatment of skin damage.</P>
<P>People with leprosy are, after a few days on chemotherapy, no longer infectious and can lead a normal social life. This has contributed in recent years to the management of leprosy programmes worldwide moving away from clinics dedicated to the treatment of leprosy to primary health care services in general. However, despite the opportunity to lead a normal social life, long-term nerve and muscle damage can lead to great psychosocial and financial difficulties, social stigmatisation and decreased quality of life. Care and awareness of limb use will in all circumstances be necessary and education of those with leprosy is considered a central element to achieve a satisfactory level of self-care (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-2002c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 2002c</LINK>). In this review we want to explore the effect of several types of potential interventions that can prevent and treat secondary damage to skin and limbs, such as education, information, self-care programmes, dressings (i.e. zinc tape, saline, iodine, gauze soaked in different ointments, dry dressings), skin care, footwear or other measures designed to prevent damage.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 08:53:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>In the protocol we had stated that studies which were clearly not randomised trials should be excluded. At least three of the studies that we found stated that they had used alternation when allocating participants to groups. Studies using such methods are considered to be quasi-randomised and are excluded from reviews whenever randomised controlled trials are stated as the inclusion criterion for type of design. However, treatments allocated alternately "are in principle unbiased being unrelated to patient characteristics", under the assumptions that the underlying sequence in which participants present to the study is random and that the procedure is concealed to the persons that assign participants (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>). Although such methods are possible to conceal, they are according to the Cochrane Handbook usually not concealed. If the allocation procedure is open it is easy to manipulate by the person in charge. This may result in a selection bias which in turn will threaten the validity of the study. However, the same requirement of concealment of the allocation schedule relates to the use of random numbers tables (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1999</LINK>). Actually, failure to conceal is found to be more important in predicting bias than other components of allocation, such as the generation of the allocation sequence, for instance by computer, random numbers table or alternation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of random numbers table makes it easier to conceal the allocation, but the Cochrane Handbook says nothing about whether use of such tables usually is blinded when concealment is not reported on. However, Pildal and colleagues who compared articles that were unclear in their reporting of allocation concealment with their protocols, revealed that only 16% of 96 studies in reality had adequate concealment in their protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2005</LINK>). Except for one study protocol that was rated as inadequate, all the others were unclear also in their protocols. Consequently, in cases where it is only stated that a random numbers table or alteration have been used, we will not be sure whether it was concealed or not and hence resulted in a "true" randomisation. Therefore, we included those studies that had used alternate allocation as well as those studies that had used a possibly open random numbers table. We rated the studies as unclear or inadequate with regard to concealment accordingly.</P>
<P>We based inclusion or exclusion on the full article. Studies that were clearly not randomised trials were excluded, others were assessed for eligibility by two authors (LMR, LF). Consensus with persisting disagreement was to be adjudicated (by AB), but this was not necessary. We kept a log of excluded studies with reasons for exclusions. We wrote to two trial authors for missing data about study designs in March 2005 and March 2006, but received no replies by March 2008.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-12 08:35:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We assessed the quality by evaluating the following components for each included study. We categorised each component as adequate, unclear, or inadequate. The quality components criteria were those suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK> since there is some evidence that these are associated with biased estimates of treatment effect:</P>
<P>(a) the method of generation of the randomisation sequence;<BR/>(b) the method of allocation concealment - it was considered 'adequate' if the assignment could not be foreseen;<BR/>(c) who was blinded/not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors);<BR/>(d) how many participants were lost to follow up in each arm (split into post-randomisation exclusion and later losses if possible), and whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention-to-treat).</P>
<P>In addition the quality assessment also included:</P>
<P>(e) degree of certainty that the participants have leprosy or complications of leprosy;<BR/>(f) baseline assessment of the participants for age, sex, duration and severity of complications;<BR/>(g) aims, interventions (with details of how it was done) and outcome measures clearly defined;<BR/>(h) use and appropriateness of statistical analyses.</P>
<P>Two authors performed the quality assessment and independently judged the components on the quality assessment form (LMR, LF). We resolved disagreements with a third author (AB). We described the quality of each study based on a summary of these components. We also assessed the overall quality of the included studies. Note that the nature of interventions made it impossible to meet all criteria adequately, i.e. blinding of providers.

<P>We included 8 trials with a total of 557 participants. All included trials were small and had included between 43 and 110 people affected by leprosy. The age range of participants in four studies was 18 to 70 years, two studies reported an average age of 42 and 46, while two studies did not report information on the age of the participants. All included studies were published between 1982 and 2004. One study had three arms and one study reported on two separately conducted trials (multicenter study). The initial assessment and baseline reporting of leprosy and damage to peripheral nerves was recorded in varying details, as was the reporting of outcome measurements and the results. The follow-up period varied from one month to one year.<BR/>
<BR/>All trials reported the primary outcome of healing of existing ulcers, measured either as percentage healed or number of ulcers healed. The other primary outcome, prevention of limb deformity was not reported in any of the included trials. All participants had skin damage at trial entry. Typical outcome measures were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>number of ulcers healed;</LI>
<LI>size of ulcers or reduction of ulcer size;</LI>
<LI>number of new ulcers;</LI>
<LI>ulcer free at one year;</LI>
<LI>ulcers not healed;</LI>
<LI>ulcers fully healed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>None of the included trials measured the outcomes we had listed as secondary or tertiary outcomes for our review.</P>
<P>The studies took place in India, Indonesia, Mexico and Ethiopia. All studies included participants affected by leprosy with plantar ulcers (simple ulcers, trophic leprosy ulcers or with anaesthetic feet), and two studies also included people with ulcers on hand and elbow (<LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>) and ulcers on palm and gluteal ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>). Most participants had simple plantar ulcers, but some studies also included participants with infected ulcers i.e. treated with antibiotics. Three studies were hospital (in-patient) based (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derberg-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Söderberg 1982</LINK>), while five were based at out-patient clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Overbeek-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Overbeek 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pring-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pring 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seboka-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Seboka 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walton-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Walton 1986</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Three trials evaluated zinc tape, two trials topical phenytoin, and one trial topical ketanserin. One trial evaluated canvas shoe and another plaster of Paris double-rocker plaster shoe. Co-interventions varied and included bed-rest, ulcer care, education, ulcers cleaned with benzalkonium chloride, soaking and drying of feet. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derberg-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Söderberg 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walton-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Walton 1986</LINK>) had statements on the social acceptability of the intervention but reported no actual findings in this regard. One trial had asked the participants which of the interventions they preferred and had also made a simple cost analysis. Two studies reported on whether there were harmful effects (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>). We have included details of all the studies in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was great diversity (or heterogeneity) between interventions and methods used to measure outcomes in the trials. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>) used similar interventions and outcome measures. Bansal and Bhatia also restricted the participants to bed rest. The rest of the studies used different interventions and comparisons and could therefore not be pooled. We were unable to extract data from the study comparing adhesive zinc tape with gauze soaked in Eusol, so we described the results from the study (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derberg-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Söderberg 1982</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 08:16:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>In the included trials it was often difficult to make out whether the participants had one or several ulcers. When the allocation is done on an individual level and the participants have several ulcers, it means that one person will contribute several times in the analysis. This represents a unit of analysis error if not corrected for. In turn, this might lead to an over-estimate of the effect because the intra-variance between healing of ulcers on the same person may be smaller than the inter-variance of healing of ulcers between individuals. In three studies the number of participants were the same as the number of ulcers, four studies may have had a unit of analysis error (but they all had results that were insignificant statistically), while the fifth used two treatments for each participant, one for each ulcer, but it is unclear how this was analysed (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials was generally poor; only three of the trials were scored as having moderate overall quality while all the others were rated as low. How each trial scored on each quality component can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Most of the trials were characterised by inadequate and unclear reporting. Only the interventions were reasonably well described; it seemed like both intervention and control groups were treated equally in all other respects. None of the studies reported on sample size calculations. Sample sizes ranged from 38 to 110, with a mean of 67 and a median of 57. Four studies most probably did do analysis by intention-to-treat, one study lost one participant in the experiment group, one study was unclear as to who was included in which analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>) and two studies clearly did not use intention-to-treat analysis (excluded lost participants from analysis).</P>

<P>All studies gave inadequate description of the randomisation procedure. Three studies stated only that the participants had been randomly assigned (<LINK REF="STD-Pring-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pring 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seboka-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Seboka 1998</LINK>), and four studies had used alternate assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Overbeek-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Overbeek 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derberg-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Söderberg 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walton-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Walton 1986</LINK>). One study had used a table of random numbers for the assignment procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>), but the authors are unclear as to whether the randomisation itself was concealed or whether it applies to the providers throughout the study: "After breaking the code at the end of the study, it was found that each group had 15 patients". None of the others specified whether the procedure had been concealed. Consequently, the trials very likely suffer from a lack of control of selection bias.</P>
<P>We assessed base-line measurements as indications of similarity of the groups and judged them as adequate in three of the eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Walton-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Walton 1986</LINK> it is stated that base-line measurements were comparable but only the age of participants in the two groups is provided (which differed by about eight years), so we rated this component as unclear accordingly. In the other studies base-line values were either not provided and therefore rated as unclear or deemed as showing diversity between groups and therefore rated as inadequate.</P>

One centre, Mangalore, had 30 participants; 15 in each group The other centre, Polambakkam, had 60 participants; 33 in the zinc tape group and 27 in the Eusol group. The outcome measure was time to heal in days and the follow-up time was one to two months. In Mangalore it took about 20 (CI 18 to 23) days on average for superficial ulcers to heal in the zinc tape group versus about 30 days (CI 27 to 33) to heal in the gauze group. For deep ulcers it took 35 (CI 30 to 40) days to heal in the zinc-tape group, while in the gauze group about 44 (CI 22 to 61) days were needed for healing. In Polambakkam the average number of days to heal in the zinc tape group for superficial wounds were about 13 (CI 9 to15) days and 23 (CI 15 to 28) days in the gauze group. For deep ulcers it took 17 days (CI 12 to 20) in the zinc tape group and 30 (CI 12 to 63) days in the gauze group. The authors of the trial state that all the participants in Mangalore wore shoes, while eighteen of the participants in Polambakkam wore shoes. We do not know if this explains the heterogeneity in the results.<BR/>
<BR/>The average healing time was shorter for ulcers treated with zinc tape compared to gauze treated ulcers, but according to the authors, this difference was only statistically significant in Polambakkam, which was the larger group. The authors state further that zinc tape has the following advantages: low cost, easy application and convenience, also it can be worn under shoes without causing pressure and is socially more acceptable as no bandages are needed. However, the authors had not asked any of the users about their preferences.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Zinc oxide tape versus povidone iodine</HEADING>
<P>In Indonesia, Overbeek et al conducted a trial where they compared zinc oxide tape with gauze soaked in 10% povidone iodine (<LINK REF="STD-Overbeek-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Overbeek 1991</LINK>). A total of 56 people were recruited and alternately allocated into 2 groups, (in 10 different clinics); the preliminary size of groups is unknown. During the investigation 18 participants were lost to follow-up and 38 people were included in the analysis; 26 in the zinc oxide tape and 12 in the iodine group. The primary outcome measure was the mean difference between groups in the reduction of the ulcer area.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome was mean surface area reduction of the ulcers between subgroups of high (walking &gt; 2.2 km per day or &gt; 4.07 hours work per day) and low (&lt; 2.2 km per day or &lt; 4.07 hours work per day) activity level of the participants in both groups. There was no information on whether numbers of ulcers were the same as numbers of persons. The follow-up was six weeks. The authors found no statistical significant difference between the groups, although the ulcer healing was in favour of zinc oxide tape: SMD 0.29 (95% CI -0.40, 0.97 <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Also regarding the difference in healing, depending on high and low activity, the healing was slightly better for the zinc tape participants with low activity compared to those with high activity, and slightly better for iodine participants with low activity compared to those with high activity (not analysed here because of the very small numbers).</P>

<I>). </I>The outcome measure was the number of completely healed ulcers. All persons had one ulcer each and there was no loss to follow-up. At three months follow-up, 37% of the ulcers in the intervention group had healed compared with 6% for the controls; the RR was 6.00 (95% CI 1.45 to 24.75 <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), i.e. the study demonstrated a statistical significant difference between the two groups as to promoting ulcer healing.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Topical phenytoin versus saline dressing</HEADING>
<P>Two Indian studies with a total of 145 participants reported the effect of topical phenytoin compared with normal saline on trophic ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>
<I>; </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>
<I>). </I>Bhatia et al used 3 comparison groups, with 15 participants in each. The total number of fully healed ulcers were the same for both intervention groups in this study, but measured as the mean percentage reduction of ulcer size, there were nevertheless some differences between the 2% and 4% phenytoin groups, but they were not statistically significant. In Bansal et al ten participants had two ulcers each, in which case one ulcer was treated with phenytoin and the other with normal saline. It is unclear if the trialists adjusted for this in the analyses. The ulcers in the Bansal study were of "varying chronicity", while in Bhatia they had "less than three months duration", i.e. acute ulcers. All participants in the Bhatia and Bansal studies had bedrest. The outcome measure was the mean percentage of ulcer volume reduction. Follow-up was done at four weeks for all participants. In the Bhatia study it is unclear whether all participants were included at the end of the study. Bhatia's study gave an estimate of SMD -2.34 (95% CI -3.30 to -1.39 <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Bansal's study gave an estimate of SMD -0.79 ( 95% CI -1.20 to 0.39 <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Both studies demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the effect of topical phenytoin versus saline dressing, favouring phenytoin.</P>

<P>The two studies comparing footwear were too clinically heterogeneous to be pooled.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Canvas shoe versus PVC-boot</HEADING>
<P>In rural Ethiopia, Seboka et al conducted a study involving 110 farmers affected by leprosy (<LINK REF="STD-Seboka-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Seboka 1998</LINK>). The participants had either one or more plantar ulcers or had a scar of a healed ulcer. They were allocated to either canvas shoe group (52) or PVC boot ("Wellington boot") group (58). The outcomes were the number of participants being ulcer free and number of particpants having ulcers not healed, acceptability of the footwear and footwear condition. The study had a one-year follow-up and one person in the canvas shoe group was lost to follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups when it came to participants being ulcer free at one year; (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.74 <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). The authors reported that no new ulcers developed during study period in either group. The RR for those having ulcers not healed at one year was 0.52 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.75 <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>), favouring the canvas shoe group, although this result was not statistically significant. They also reported that PVC boots were much more durable than the canvas shoes, but they could become very hot. Eighty percent of the farmers rated PVC boots as "excellent" for social acceptability and suitability for work. The canvas shoes were rated as socially acceptable, but not rated as highly suitable for work.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Double-rocker plaster shoe versus below-knee plaster</HEADING>
<P>Pring's Indian study reported a comparison of a traditional below-knee plaster with a padded, moulded double-rocker plaster shoe (<LINK REF="STD-Pring-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pring 1982</LINK>). Forty-seven people affected by leprosy with a total of 55 plantar ulcers were randomly allocated to both groups. In addition dressings with magnesium sulphate, glycerine and acriflavine were applied to all ulcers and removed after six weeks, at follow-up. Also, at the time of application and removal of plasters all participants were given health education on foot care (daily foot inspection, foot soaking and scraping, and the importance of the regular wearing of soft-lined chappals. Outcome measures were ulcers fully healed, ulcers nearly healed and ulcers failed to heal. The authors found that of the 31 ulcers treated with plaster shoe, 18 were fully healed after 6 weeks; 8 were nearly healed and 5 failed to heal. Of the 24 ulcers treated by below-knee plaster, 18 were fully healed, 3 nearly healed and 3 had failed to heal after 6 weeks. The authors state that the plaster shoe was more acceptable to the person affected by leprosy and cheaper to apply. The statistical analysis of ulcers fully healed showed (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.88 <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) in favour of the below-knee plaster group; nearly healed (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.61 to 6.96 <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>) in favour of the double rocker plaster shoe group; and for ulcers not healed (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.93 <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>) favouring the plaster shoe group, i.e. no statistical significant differences between groups were demonstrated.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-07 14:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We found and included eight studies with a kind of randomisation procedure for allocating participants to groups. Although the three studies that compared zinc tape to more traditional dressings found some benefit, none of these had a statistically significant effect. Topical ketanserin had a better clinical effect on wound healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste. The two studies that compared topical phenytoin to saline dressing demonstrated a statistically significant effect in both studies. Canvas shoes were not much better than PVC-boots and double rocker shoes did not promote healing more than below-knee plasters. None of the studies reported any harms caused by the treatment, except for a general statement by the trial authors of the plaster study that plasters in general may result in osteoporosis of bones in the foot caused by lack of use, which in turn may result in fractures when plaster is removed.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-04-30 13:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies we identified were not sufficient to address all of the objectives of the review. Our objective was to investigate whether there were interventions that could prevent or treat secondary damage to the skin in people with leprosy, for example self-care, dressings or appropriate footwear. We found eight studies altogether of seven different interventions, so the lack of replication of studies in itself limits the reliability and applicability of results. As none of the comparisons were done crosswise we can draw no conclusions as to which of the interventions were the most effective. Likewise, none of the studies investigated whether the interventions had the potential to reduce social stigma and lead to better quality of life. We did not find any trials that evaluated the effect of self-care or educational interventions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-05-08 10:09:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The studies that we included did not allow any robust conclusion regarding the objectives they addressed. There were several reasons for this. Overall, it was difficult to assess the validity of the results of the studies, due to the lack of clear reporting of methods and data in general and of the allocation process in particular. We do recognise that these studies were reported at a time when the importance of a full description of the allocation process had not been much focused on in contemporary literature. In fact, only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>) would have had a chance to report according to previous (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) or current guidelines for reporting clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The empirical evidence for whether one can suppose that the allocation procedure has been concealed or not in the real setting, when not reported on, is conflicting (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2005</LINK>). For example, in one study, authors of 40 rheumatology articles published in 1997/1998, in which the statement regarding allocation concealment was unclear, were asked by means of a questionnaire whether they in fact had concealed the allocation procedure and in 78% of 32 trials, the allocation process was reported by their trialists to have been concealed (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2002</LINK>). In a study by <LINK REF="REF-Deveraux--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deveraux 2004</LINK>, 98 articles reporting trials in 29 journals in the period 1997 to 1998, were assessed for reports of concealment of allocation. They found 54 out of 56 (96%) trials with an unclear allocation procedure in the published documents were reported by the researchers in a telephone interview to actually have used concealment when allocation to groups had been done. However, a third study collected 102 authorised protocols of randomised controlled trials for the years 1994 and 1995 from two districts in Denmark (<LINK REF="REF-Pildal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pildal 2005</LINK>). They were used for verification of whether concealment had been done or not when the statement in their corresponding publications was unclear. The authors found that only 16% (15/96) of the publications not reporting concealment had stated in the protocol that this would be done. Compared to using the authors' self-report to determine the real occurrence of concealment, using the protocols for verification of actual use, seems more credible.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we consider that the studies included in our review that did not report on allocation concealment, most likely did not conceal the allocation process, which in consequence may have led to selection bias.</P>
<P>One included study clearly used blinded assessors to assess degree of ulcer healing and one study most likely used blinded assessors. Due to the small sample sizes, the conclusions in all trials may be subjected to the possibility of both erroneously seeing a difference when there is none (type I error) and erroneously not seeing a difference when there is one (type II error), as the risk of both errors increases with small samples. Moreover, only one comparison was replicated so the other comparisons were all only done in one study. As demonstrated in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 1993</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2004</LINK>) there seems to be a lack of consensus of how to measure wound surface area. This may result in less reliable, imprecise and non-comparable measures. A complete healing of wounds would be easier to measure objectively than surface area and also would be the outcome of greatest interest to people with leprosy as well as to healthcare providers. Others have recommended that investigators measure time to healing, analysed as a life table or by survival analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Palfreyman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palfreyman 2006</LINK>). For some of the trials the follow-up time was only four weeks and this might be somewhat short - results from one of the included trials indicate that ulcers may need a longer healing period.</P>
<P>Shaw and colleagues conducted a systematic review on the clinical effect of topical phenytoin on wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2007</LINK>). They too found that most papers failed to describe randomisation, treatment allocation and blinding techniques adequately. The authors included prospective controlled trials or RCTs and carefully concluded that topical phenytoin might have a positive effect on wound healing in a variety of wounds (including leprosy).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-04-30 14:05:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the inadequate reporting of the trials is the most important threat to the validity of the review process. This may have led to misunderstandings during the critical appraisal of the studies and of our descriptions and evaluations. We have not assessed potential publication bias. Since several studies with no significant effect and also with very few participants, have been published, this is an indicator that suggests that publication bias in this case is not very likely. However, we cannot know if we have identified all relevant studies. The trials we found were small, so similar sized trials may have been done and not been reported. The authors of the included trials may have done additional trials. Also, the countries in which the trials were done, are not well represented in the databases we searched (except for LILACS). For example, Indian literature may have escaped our searches. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Which of the interventions are the most effective?</HEADING>
<P>Topical ketanserin may be more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste and topical phenytoin may be more effective than saline dressing in ulcer healing. However, this is based on very weak evidence, for topical ketanserin only one study tested the comparison and for phenytoin the summary analysis of two studies did not show a very clear effect. For the other comparisons the results were equivocal. Whether the interventions reduce social stigma and lead to better quality of life were not investigated in any of the trials. Three studies reported that no side effects of treatment were observed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-07 15:33:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>The disabilities resulting from sensory nerve damage in leprosy, have a serious impact on the quality of life of the persons affected. Not only is it potentially disabling, but since leprosy still carries social stigma, visible signs of the presence of the disease in the person concerned may cause distress and prejudice. Research should not be neglected, as there is a need for high quality research in the field of ulcer prevention and treatment in people with leprosy. However, research projects in the management of skin changes and ulcers in leprosy need to be improved regarding methodological quality, including setting a standard in identifying suitable outcome measures. An important tool to attain improved quality is to follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>In particular this research should aim to compare:<BR/>(a) different types of dressings, including dry dressings;<BR/>(b) different types of topical agents;<BR/>(c) topical agents versus dressings;<BR/>(d) different types of footwear;<BR/>(e) different self-care and educational programmes.<BR/>

<P>We made some changes to the Background to update it.</P>
<P>In Methods, in the section 'Criteria for considering studies for this review' under 'Types of studies' we included trials that used an alternating allocation.</P>

<P>In the same section under 'Measures of treatment effect' we changed the effect estimate from Odds Ratio stated in the protocol to Relative Risk. This was because ulcers are quite common in people with nerve damage caused by leprosy.</P>
<P>Also in Methods, in the section 'Search methods for identification of studies' under 'Searching other resources' we were unable to handsearch the Indian Journal of Leprosy as it was not available, and we did not contact adverse events bodies for information.</P>
