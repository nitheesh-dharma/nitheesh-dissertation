<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Psychological factors may have an effect on asthma in children, or its severity. As some children with families who are having problems have severe asthma, family therapy has been tried. The aim is to resolve any problems there might be in a family, in case they are causing the child stress and then making asthma worse. The review found some evidence from two trials that family therapy (in addition to standard asthma treatments) might help reduce a child's asthma symptoms, but more research is needed to be certain.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Psychosocial and emotional factors are important in childhood asthma. Nevertheless, drug therapy alone continues to be the main treatment. Treatment programmes that include behavioural or psychological interventions have been developed to improve disturbed family relations in the families of children with severe asthma. These approaches have been extended to examine the efficacy of family therapy to treat childhood asthma in a wider group of patients. This review systematically examines these studies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Recognition that asthma can be associated with emotional disturbances has led to the investigation of the role of family therapy in reducing the symptoms and impact of asthma in children. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of family therapy as an adjunct to medication for the treatment of asthma in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, and checked the reference lists in trial reports and review articles. The most recent search was carried out in January 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing children undergoing systematic therapy focusing on the family in conjunction with asthma medication, with children taking asthma medication only.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviwers (JY and CS) applied the study inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials with a total of 55 children were included. It was not possible to combine the findings of these two studies because of differences in outcome measures used. In one study, gas volume, peak expiratory flow rate and daytime wheeze showed improvement in family therapy patients compared to controls. In the other study, there was an improvement in overall clinical assessment and number of functionally impaired days in the patients receiving family therapy. There was no difference in forced expiratory volume or medication use in both studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some indication that family therapy may be a useful adjunct to medication for children with asthma. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-24 10:37:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The incidence of childhood asthma has increased annually at a rapid rate over the last 20 years. A variety of factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma including allergies, infections, endocrinological disorders, genetic predisposition and, more recently, psychological elements. Although psychological factors are widely acknowledged to play a part both in precipitating episodes of asthma, and in the control of symptoms, pharmacological treatment alone continues to be the main treatment, and therefore the focus of most research. Recently, however, traditional medical models upholding a split between the "psyche" and the "soma" are being replaced by those which recognise the powerful influences of the mind on the body. Similarly, the need for integrated treatment models which consider behavioural or psychological interventions in addition to pharmacotherapy are well documented (<LINK REF="STD-Cluss-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cluss 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onnis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Onnis 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molinari-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Molinari 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Towns-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Towns 1994</LINK>)</P>
<P>Studies which do acknowledge psychosocial aspects to the disease range from cognitive behavioural approaches, to education programmes, relaxation techniques, autogenic therapy, and rational emotive behaviour modification as an adjunct to medication. However, such studies, although recognising that asthma has strong associations with emotional disturbances, have been conducted mainly with adults.</P>
<P>Of the few studies which examine psychological influences in childhood asthma, psychosocial and emotional factors are regarded as important in the most severely ill of asthmatic children (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK>). A child's chronic illness can place psychological burdens on both child and family (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pless-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pless 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhauer-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhauer 1974</LINK>). In addition, Weil (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1999</LINK>) concluded that two psychological variables, child and carer mental health, were important predictors of subsequent asthma morbidity. The earliest research conducted in the 1970s indicated the presence of disturbed family relations in the families of children with severe asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Liebman-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Liebman 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liebman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Liebman 1976</LINK>). This prompted a limited number of trials to be conducted in the area of family therapy.</P>
<P>The theoretical basis which underpins the systemic view of family therapy presupposes that "symptoms" can be the product of a dysfunctional family system. Therapeutic intervention is used to alert the family system to its dysfunctional behaviours and to empower it to adaptively overcome the difficulties which give rise to the symptoms. The body of research undertaken so far has been based on a structural family therapy perspective which assumes that relationships between family members adhere to certain patterns, which are often maladaptive to the current life situation. Systemic theories regard phenomena in terms of circularity, rather than in the linear terms of cause and effect inherent to the medical model of illness. Therefore asthma is assumed to be both a symptom of the family dysfunction, and a contributor to it (<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK>). Family therapy has been used to decrease the symptoms and impact of asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to test whether family therapy as an adjunct to traditional medication can be shown to have a significant effect in reducing the symptoms and impact of asthma in children.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-24 10:33:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>During data extraction and through personal communication with the authors, it was noted that for the analysis of some outcomes, had employed a cross-over design. Since it had previously been decided to enter onto 'Review Manager' only analyses which maintained the study groups according to the original randomization procedure, the analyses performed after cross-over were not included and readers are referred to the original paper for this information.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-24 10:32:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The methodological quality of the studies (allocation concealment) was independently assessed by two reviewers (JY and CS) using the following criteria for allocation concealment:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment<BR/>Grade D: Not used</P>
<P>There were no disagreements on ratings given to the studies.</P>
<P>Each study was also assessed using the modified 0 to 5 scale developed by Jadad 1996 and summarised as follows:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>2. Was the outcome assessment blinded (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>5. Was the method of blinding well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>6. Deduct on point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>
<P>Modification of this scale was essential as, due to the nature of the psychological interventions, it would be difficult to conduct double-blind trials. Therefore step 2 and 5 'double-blind' was changed to 'blind'.</P>

<P>Two RCTs were included. Between them, a maximum of 55 children with asthma and their families were studied, although not all participants were included in each comparison.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK> was a controlled,randomised, unblinded study. Reported outcomes were objective measures of lung function. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK> was a controlled, randomised, single blinded study. Reported outcomes were objective measures of lung function and measures of asthma impact: General paediatric assessment; participant reported number of impaired days; participant reported number of nights where a beta2-agonist was used.

<P>None of the studies reviewed for this update (n = 4) were included. Only the two originally included trials were appropriate for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>).</P>

<P>The children from both studies were attending hospital outpatient departments for their asthma symptoms. Children eligible for selection in the trials were required to have asthma symptoms graded as C or D (as defined by where Grade C = children with a continuing history of episodic asthma over a number of years and D = children with a current history of very frequent or chronic unremitting asthma). The children were aged between 4 and 15 years. The duration of illness was only reported in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>, (mean = 7 years). Three families had more than one asthmatic child and all were included in the assessments. All children used bronchodilators, and some children were also using inhaled steroids. Children fitting these criteria and their families were selected for the trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cultural setting</HEADING>
<P>One study was conducted at a London postgraduate teaching hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK>) and the other at a University Hospital in Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Description of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Neither trial reports on the training or background of the clinicians who gave the family therapy. Both trials assume the importance of therapists meeting the whole or part of the family for effective therapeutic intervention. The role of the asthma symptoms within the family system was explored in both trials. Focus was on specific themes such as the varying attitudes to the illness, the doctor and the medication, the fear of death and the experiencing of painful and frightening emotions (<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK>) in an attempt at enhancing communication between family members about the emotional impact of the disease (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors drew upon different theories in their explanations of the aims of family therapy for this group. The paper by <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK> draws on theories from the structural family therapy model which conceptualises families in terms of boundaries, hierarchies, and sub-systems. The strengthening of boundaries between individuals and hierarchical sub-systems, and the revelation of hidden conflicts is thereby assumed to alter dysfunctional patterns of interaction between family members. In this way the source of family tension is reduced or re-routed away from the asthmatic child. The paper by <LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK> suggests that stresses in the family are alleviated by focusing on themes and attitudes towards the illness. In turn the attitudes of the family may be altered from the extreme to the more realistic, thus helping to promote an improvement in the psychological well-being of the family.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-24 10:37:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>It must be noted that this review concerns itself only with studies which have used family therapy in addition to traditional pharmacological treatments and not as an alternative. Of the only two randomised controlled trials conducted in this area, both demonstrated that children given family therapy in addition to their normal asthma medication show more improvements in their asthma symptoms than those treated with medication alone. Theories suggest that conflicts and relationships between family members are improved, and morbid fears and anxieties alleviated through family therapy interventions. Although the two trials do not show improvements in the same outcomes, a variety of improvements are demonstrated.</P>
<P>A number of our outcomes (health care utilisation (apart from emergency hospitalisations by <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1986</LINK>), school absenteeism, and psychological and behavioral indicators) were not evaluated in the included studies. These outcomes are considered to be important indicators of overall well-being and therefore, we recommend their inclusion in trials evaluating psychologically orientated interventions as found in a related review of psychological interventions for children with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Yorke-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorke 2005</LINK>)</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Lung Function</HEADING>
<P>Compared with controls, an improvement in Thoracic Gas Volume (TGV) was found in those who had family therapy. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was also found to have improved post family therapy, but within the experimental group and not compared with the control group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>There are also indications that children receiving family therapy suffered fewer functionally impaired days than those who were on prescribed medication alone. Day wheezing also decreased in the experimental group of one study. One of the studies demonstrated improvements in a variety of subjective and objective measures of general health.</P>
<P>Despite the generally positive nature of these findings in favour of family therapy, it must be remembered that they have been derived from the only two randomised controlled trials published in this area. These two studies employed different outcome measures, which were often un-standardised, ascertained these measures at different baseline and post-treatment time periods, and used small samples. Missing data from one of the studies undermines the validity of some of the findings. These methodological limitations and restrictions make it difficult to draw conclusions which are generalisable to a wider population.</P>
<P>The assumptions behind family therapy treatment may have different epistemological bases, according to the model used, thus affecting the types of therapeutic interventions that would occur. For instance family therapy given by therapists who believe asthma to have a function in re-routing conflicts within the family, may use an entirely different approach to those whose aim is to explore the impact of the disease on different family members and their relationships with one another. It is also important to note that the theories and practice of family therapy have changed to include a broader range of perspectives since the two studies included in this review were published. Future studies need to be more specific about the interventions and the models from which they derive in order to help distinguish which psychological phenomena have the most impact on the alleviation of asthma symptoms.</P>
<P>Finally, in only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Lask-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lask 1979</LINK>) was any attempt made to control for the effects of increased attention alone on the patient and their families. The author told us that each control group patient was seen for 30 minutes longer than normal and was seen more often than normal. This makes it difficult to conclude whether it is the family therapy treatment itself or merely the extra attention on the patients and families, which has generated the improvement in asthma symptoms. Future studies are clearly warranted to compare trials conducted with alternative psychological interventions or 'placebo' + medication with trials using family therapy + medication, in order for these effects to be controlled.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Family therapy does appear to produce benefits for children with asthma, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. It should be noted that, since this these trials were performed, the theories and practice of family therapy have changed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This appears to be a field of treatment for asthma that warrants further research. This would require larger randomised trials, standardised rating scales and outcome measures, at similar time periods. We aslo recommend the inclusion of outcome measures that represent a child's overall well-being and enable an analysis as to the economic value of such interventions, such as health care utilisation, school absenteeism, and psychological and behavioral indicators. Such studies are important in the light of the growing body of evidence supporting theories that the impact of asthma is not based upon molecular or organic processes alone, but involves a complex interrelationship between these and psychological phenomena.</P>
