<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-30 11:33:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer of the vulva is mainly a disease of elderly women. Surgery involves removal of the tumour and surrounding lymph nodes, occasionally followed by radiotherapy. Although survival rates are high if the tumour is found early enough, removal of the lymph nodes causes odema (swelling), particularly in the legs. Wound healing and psychosexual problems are also common. While radiotherapy may be effective in the short term, there is not enough evidence from trials to show that it is as effective as surgery in preventing tumour regrowth in the lymph nodes of the groin.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-10 09:42:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite changes in technique, morbidity after surgery for vulvar cancer is high and mainly related to the groin dissection. Primary radiotherapy to the groin is expected to result in lower morbidity. However, studies on the efficacy of primary radiotherapy to the groin in terms of groin recurrences and survival show conflicting results.</P>

<P>We selected randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing inguinofemoral lymph node dissection and primary radiotherapy of the inguinofemoral lymph nodes for patients with early squamous cell cancer of the vulva.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-03-11 10:25:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and extracted results. Primary outcome measures were the incidence of groin recurrences, patient survival and morbidity.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 12:51:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>No new RCTs were identified by the updated search. Out of twelve identified papers only one met the selection criteria. From this one small RCT of 52 women, there was a trend towards increased groin recurrence rates (relative risk (RR) 10.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 175.78), lower disease-specific survival rates (RR 3.70, 95% CI 0.87 to 15.80), less lymphoedema (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.03) and fewer life-threatening cardiovascular complications (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.45) in the radiotherapy group. Primary surgery was associated with a longer hospital stay than primary groin irradiation (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 12:50:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Primary radiotherapy to the groin results in less morbidity but may be associated with a higher risk of groin recurrence and decreased survival when compared with surgery. Due to the small numbers in this trial and criticisms regarding the depth of radiotherapy applied, corroboration of these findings by larger RCTs using a standardised radiotherapy method, is desirable. However, until better evidence is available, surgery should be considered the first choice treatment for the groin nodes in women with vulvar cancer. Individual patients not physically able to withstand surgery may be treated with primary radiotherapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-29 13:07:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-03-29 13:03:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Vulval cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly women with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years. The incidence in industrialised countries is around 3 per 100,000 women per year (<LINK REF="REF-UKStats-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKStats 2000</LINK>). According to population-based studies, approximately 75% of vulvar malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Platz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Velden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Velden 1996</LINK>) although this figure may be as high as 90% (<LINK REF="REF-de-Hulle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Hulle 2004</LINK>). Primarily the tumour metastasises to the inguinofemoral lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morley-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the older (pre-1988) clinical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, early vulvar cancer was categorised as stage I or II disease. After 1988 the FIGO staging became pathological. However, for the purposes of this review, we used the TNM classification of malignant tumours where early vulvar cancer is defined as cancer in which the primary tumour is confined to the vulva without clinically suspicious groin nodes or clinical suspicion of distant metastases i.e. patients with cT1 to T2, N0 to T1, M0 tumours (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for staging classifications).</P>
<P>Pre-treatment risk of groin lymph node metastases appears to be of the order of 15% for T1 toT2 N0 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sedlis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedlis 1987</LINK>) and 10% for T1 N0 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sedlis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedlis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Velden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Velden 1996</LINK>). Groin lymph node metastases are associated with a poorer prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Homesley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homesley 1991</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-03-29 13:07:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Current standard treatment for patients with clinical T1 to T2 N0 M0 tumours is primary surgery, followed by radiotherapy if indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1993</LINK>). Surgery usually consists of radical excision of the tumour and bilateral inguinal and femoral lymph node dissection. This treatment policy results in excellent survival figures, and the incidence of tumour recurrences in the groin after surgery in patients with clinically non-suspicious (N0) lymph nodes is often reported as less than 2% (<LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Velden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Velden 1996</LINK>). Unfortunately, surgery is associated with high complication rates: wound healing problems are observed in a large proportion of patients, and in the long term, lymphoedema and psychosexual complications are frequently seen. In one study, 49% of patients experienced wound breakdown and 27% experienced chronic lymphoedema following this radical surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Homesley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homesley 1991</LINK>), however some studies report even higher figures. The high complication rates have prompted many investigators to look for less radical surgery and a more individualized approach (<LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1993</LINK>). As morbidity is mainly related to the dissection of the inguinal-femoral lymph nodes, modifications in the surgical approach have been introduced into practice, specifically, a triple incision technique instead of an en-bloc resection, and a unilateral groin dissection instead of a bilateral groin dissection. These changes in surgical technique have been the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ansink-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansink 1999</LINK>). Recently the sentinel node technique has been introduced into the diagnostic workup and treatment of early vulvar cancer whereby sentinel nodes are identified using a radioactive tracer and blue dye, and removed (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Zee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Zee 2008</LINK>). In an observational study by <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Zee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Zee 2008</LINK>, only 6 out of 259 women (2.3%) with T1 to T2 N0 vulvar cancer experienced a groin recurrence after a negative sentinel node was reported. Despite the changes in technique of groin dissection, morbidity is still considerable for the group of patients who are not candidates for the sentinel node procedure.</P>
<P>Some investigators recommend radiotherapy for the primary treatment of groin lymph nodes in early vulvar cancer which has a lower risk of acute and late morbidity than primary surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>). Primary radiotherapy for the groin in early vulvar cancer results in less tumour recurrences in the groin compared with a 'wait and see' policy (<LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>). Groin recurrence rates after primary radiotherapy range from 0% to 14% in non-randomised studies (NRS) (<LINK REF="STD-Hallak-S-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hallak S 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>) which all have methodological shortcomings, e.g. data on early vulvar cancer often cannot be extracted separately from other stages of disease (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>), or non-standard surgical procedures have been used (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>). Similarly, reliable survival figures on primary radiotherapy for early vulvar cancer are scarce.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK> was the only RCT included and we consider it to be of low to moderate risk of bias. Randomisation was done in blocks and balanced across participating institutions. However, no details of allocation concealment are described. Patients and personnel could not be blinded to intervention group allocation for obvious reasons. Of the 58 patients initially randomised, six were withdrawn after randomisation due to incorrect staging (five) or due to the incorrect primary site (one), leaving 52 for analysis (27 in the radiotherapy group and 25 in the surgery group). Investigators had planned to recruit 300 patients but the trial was stopped early when 5 out of 27 patients in the radiotherapy group experienced groin recurrences. All pre-specified outcomes were addressed, although morbidity data were not clearly presented and could not all be extracted for comparison here. Patients in the radiotherapy group were slightly younger and had a better 'performance status', however we considered that these differences were unlikely to have impacted substantially on the findings.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-29 16:02:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Vulvar cancer is a rare disease, therefore conducting RCTs on the treatment thereof is difficult. However, it becomes clear how important these RCTs are when one considers the shortcomings of the existing observational and case-control studies.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 16:02:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Based on one small RCT reviewed here, there was no statistically significant difference in groin recurrence or disease-specific survival between the radiotherapy and surgery groups although the trend favours the surgery group. As expected, morbidity outcomes favoured the radiotherapy group.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-03-10 14:52:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High quality evidence is sparse in this field. None of the outcomes addressed by this review have been answered completely by the available data. The controversy over the radiotherapy method and dose limits the applicability of the <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK> study. <I>See</I> <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK> below.</P>
<P>Although not many studies are available, it is obvious that morbidity after primary radiotherapy is low. Reversible grade I skin reactions are the main problem, while the incidence of lymphoedema is significantly less than reported after surgery. There is no doubt that additional problems after surgery such as infection and wound separation are not seen after radiotherapy. The occurrence of severe life-threatening cardiovascular complications occurred in five out of 25 patients (20%) in the surgery group in the <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK> trial, reinforcing the risks associated with this radical procedure.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-03-29 16:02:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The incidence of groin recurrence was much higher in the <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK> study compared with some NRS (<LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>); however the risk of selection and other biases in these studies was high e.g. by selecting patients with a low pre-treatment risk of nodal metastases for radiotherapy. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK> has been criticised in the radiotherapy literature (<LINK REF="REF-Lanciano-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanciano 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>) because the technique of radiotherapy applied was insufficient to sterilise subclinical lymph node metastases in the groin. The mean depth of the deeper groin nodes (the femoral group of nodes, under the fascia lata, at the level of the femoral vessels) is between 4.5 cm (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 1995</LINK>) and 6.1 cm (<LINK REF="REF-Koh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 1993</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK>, the radiotherapy was dosed at a depth of 3 cm and this suggests that many of the patients were under-dosed at the level of the deeper, femoral lymph nodes. This casts doubt on the reliability of the data.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-03-18 12:39:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although primary radiotherapy for the groin results in less short term and long term morbidity compared with inguinal and femoral groin dissection, there is not enough evidence to prove that it is as effective regarding control of tumours in the groin. In the only RCT, tumour recurrence and survival were both better in the surgery arm overall, although the irradiation dose may have been inadequate. In daily practice this means that surgery is the first choice treatment for the groin lymph nodes in early vulvar cancer. When the condition of the patient is such that the increased risk of morbidity with the use of surgery outweighs the chances of cure, then primary radiotherapy is a good alternative treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-29 16:03:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The role of radiotherapy in primary groin treatment remains uncertain. There is a need for a large well-conducted RCT, comparing primary radiotherapy of adequate dose, depth and volume with primary surgery, to address this uncertainty. However, the debate about primary radiotherapy or primary surgery for the groin in early vulvar cancer is now definitely influenced by the outcome of the 'sentinel node' studies. In these studies, the area around the vulvar tumour is injected with a radioactive colloid. The first lymph node in the groin to pick up the radioactive colloid is considered the 'sentinel node'. It is hypothesised that the presence or absence of tumour involvement in this node will predict whether the remaining nodes in the groin are affected. When the predictive value of the 'sentinel node' is sufficiently high, 80% of T1-2 N0 vulvar cancers will not need treatment for the groin because of a negative sentinel node. However, when a positive sentinel node is found, primary radiotherapy may have a role to play. An observational study is currently underway on this subject, and a RCT comparing radiotherapy versus lymph node dissection for sentinel positive nodes in early vulvar cancer would be desirable.</P>

<P>52 patients with primary, previously untreated, squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (T1-3 N0-1 M0). A radical vulvectomy had to suffice to remove the lesion; patients with T1 tumours were eligible only if there was vascular space involvement or if invasion &gt; 5 mm; no suspicious lymph nodes (N0-1); no distant metastases. Needle aspiration was required if there was any concern over lymph node status.</P>

<P>Retrospective observational study. 294 cases of vulvar cancer were given post-operative radiotherapy after standard surgery which included inguinal lymphadenectomy in only 27 cases. 110 patients had Stage I disease.</P>
<P>Two separate inguinal fields were irradiated with combined photon (6MeV) and electron (12 MeV) beams. Dose 47.5 Gy to 54 Gy; depth: relative depth dose &gt; 100 from 2 till 7 cm. Three different fraction schedules were used.</P>
<P>Follow-up was for a minimum of 10 years. Overall, 127 recurrences were recorded (43%) - 15/110 patients with Stage 1 disease (14%). The 5-year survival of the Stage I group was 69% and relapse free survival (RFS) was 60%. RFS rate was not associated with the type of surgery performed (total/partial vulvectomy or local tumour excision) The inguinal relapse free rate was 75% both for patients treated with adjuvant inguinal irradiation without lymphadenectomy (n=201) and patients treated with primary lymphadenectomy ± inguinal irradiation (n=27). It was not possible to identify the inguinal relapse free rate for the stage I/II patients who had radiotherapy as sole treatment for the groins separately. Post-op complications were significantly more frequent in the subgroup undergoing lymphadenectomy.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> The control risk is of groin recurrence after surgery is assumed to be 2% based on incidence of groin recurrence after surgery by van der Velden 1996.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> The original sample size was 300 patients but the trial was stopped early, after 58 enrolments, due to perceived dis-benefit in the radiotherapy group.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Radiotherapy was applied to a depth of 3cm only. The mean depth of deeper groin nodes is estimated at 4.5-6.1cm, therefore the radiotherapy dose used in this trial may have been insufficient for deep nodes.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-29 16:33:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Search Strategy</HEADING>
<P>For the original review, The Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRALl) were searched using the criteria set by the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006). A MEDLINE (1966 to 2006) and EMBASE (1988 to 2006) search using the Mesh Heading ´vulvar neoplasms´ and text word ´vulva´ was performed. Publications on the effectiveness of primary radiotherapy treatment of early squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were selected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study Selection and Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Nine papers met the initial selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Daly-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edsmyr-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Edsmyr 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leiserowitz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leiserowitz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pirtoli-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pirtoli 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK>) with three being included in the original review (one RCT, one case-control and one observational study). All studies were assessed with the aid of a critical review form. We used three different critical review forms: one for RCTs, one for case control studies and studies with historic controls, and one for observational studies.</P>
<P>The critical review forms were filled out independently by both review authors. Differences were resolved by discussion. We included studies that met at least the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>All participants had clinical cT1-2N0,M0 vulvar cancer, or it was possible to analyse these participants separately.</LI>
<LI>Radiotherapeutic interventions are described adequately.</LI>
<LI>For studies with (non-randomised) controls, interventions should be the same in each group, apart from the experimental intervention.</LI>
<LI>Site of recurrence is mentioned precisely.</LI>
<LI>More than five patients meeting the above mentioned criteria are included in the study.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Six studies were excluded from further analysis for the following reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Impossible to analyse incidence of groin recurrences in relation to initial stage of disease separately (<LINK REF="STD-Edsmyr-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Edsmyr 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leiserowitz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leiserowitz 1997</LINK>;).</LI>
<LI>Site of recurrence not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Pirtoli-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pirtoli 1982</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Incidence of groin recurrences cannot be analysed separately in relation to early stage of disease (<LINK REF="STD-Petereit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Petereit 1993</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Insufficient numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Daly-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1974</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias associated with the NRSs</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the five included studies is fair. Problems that remain after the selection process as described above are:</P>
<P>(1) Three studies also include patients with non-squamous histology (<LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hallak-S-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hallak S 2007</LINK>).<BR/>(2) One study does not mention the duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>).<BR/>(3) No study addresses the problems of sexuality (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manavi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manavi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stehman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stehman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hallak-S-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hallak S 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>(4) One study does not mention the stage of disease for patients in the surgery group (Hallak S 2007a)</P>
