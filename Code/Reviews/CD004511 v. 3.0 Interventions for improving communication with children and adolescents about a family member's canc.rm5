<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Communicating well with children and adolescents about a sibling's cancer can improve their knowledge and understanding as well as their coping, adjustment and wellbeing</P>
<P>It has not been common for families and health practitioners to share information with children or adolescents about a family member's cancer. Interventions to try to help young people cope with cancer in the family include printed information materials, counseling, education and support programs, sibling group programs and art, play and music therapy. The review found limited evidence of some interventions for children and adolescents about a sibling's cancer only. Structured group interventions and camping programs for healthy siblings improved knowledge and understanding about their sibling's cancer, and improved coping, adjustment and wellbeing. There was no evidence of harm.

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A diagnosis of cancer creates multiple problems for affected families, including major changes in living patterns, roles and relationships. It has not been common practice for families and health practitioners to share information with children or adolescents about a family member's cancer, or to allow them to express their feelings about this. In recent years, however, researchers and practitioners have begun to recognise that children and adolescents might appreciate and benefit by being better informed about, and having more opportunity to communicate their responses to, cancer in the family. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effects of different ways of enhancing communication with children and/or adolescents about a family member's cancer and its treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:37:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We searched the following sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1 2003; MEDLINE (1966 to January week 2 2003); EMBASE (1985 to 2003 week 6); CINAHL (1982 to February Week 1 2003); ERIC (1966 to 23 January 2003); PsycINFO (1985 to February week 1 2003).</P>
<P>For the original (1999, unpublished) version of this review we also searched the following databases: CancerLIT, Health Management Information Consortium, British Nursing Index, IAC Health &amp; Wellness, JICSTE-Plus, Pascal, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Mental Health Abstracts, AMED, HUMN, MANTIS and ASSIA. Bibliographies of identified studies were also checked and contact made with experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and controlled and uncontrolled before and after studies that evaluated the effects of interventions to enhance communication with children and/or adolescents about a family member's cancer and its treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:38:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Data on knowledge and understanding, coping, adjustment and wellbeing were extracted by one review author and checked by another review author. We assessed study quality using six criteria. We present a qualitative synthesis of the results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies satisfied the selection criteria: one non-randomised controlled before and after study, and four uncontrolled before and after studies. They differed in terms of the interventions evaluated and the outcomes measured. One study of a camping program and two studies of structured group interventions reported improvements in cancer-related knowledge. One out of two structured group intervention studies found significant reductions in psychological and social problems. The camping program study reported significant improvements in siblings' behaviour. One structured group intervention study reported significantly more positive mood states after the intervention. Another structured group intervention study reported significantly lower levels of anxiety after the intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Different methods of communicating with children and adolescents about a family member's cancer have not been widely evaluated in controlled trials. There is weak evidence to suggest that some interventions, such as structured group interventions, may lead to improvements in knowledge and understanding, in coping, anxiety, adjustment and wellbeing. More research is needed to investigate the comparative value of these interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:41:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>A diagnosis of cancer creates multiple problems for affected families, including major changes in living patterns, roles and relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Piro-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piro 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hymovich-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hymovich 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monaco-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monaco 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1993</LINK>). Children are especially vulnerable in this context. It has not been common practice for families and health practitioners to share information or allow for children to express their feelings or to be involved when a family member had cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Rittenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rittenberg 1996</LINK>). However, there is now increasing recognition that children need information and support to help them construct personal and social meaning for illness and death (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hymovich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hymovich 1995</LINK>). It is argued that enabling children to assimilate information and feelings also allows them to cope better (<LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Greenly-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Greenly 1983</LINK>). If parents and practitioners do not communicate frankly about such issues, children might construct their own explanations, which can lead them to fantasise a worse situation than is actually the case, and lead to a mistrust of adults and health practitioners in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Jennings-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennings 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCue-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCue 1994</LINK>). 
<BR/>

<BR/>The diagnosis and treatment of cancer in a family member can be very stressful to children and adolescents. For example, a well sibling can face frequent disruptions to usual activities, and repeated separations from one or both parents and the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1983</LINK>). This can cause feelings of rejection, hurt and anger (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simeon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simeon 1984</LINK>). The increase in attention for the ill sibling, coupled with a possible increase in the well sibling's responsibility for household duties, may result in strong feelings of jealousy and resentment (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1984</LINK>). These feelings may in turn lead to guilt and self-directed anger in the well sibling and perhaps to lasting emotional problems.</P>
<P>Parents play an important role in meeting the communication needs of children when a family member has cancer. Parents are usually, though not always, gatekeepers or conduits for communication for their child. Communication with children and adolescents about a family member's cancer should be seen in the context of the family and other social structures that might provide support. This can make communicating with them about the disease and its treatment a more sensitive and complex task than with adults.</P>
<P>Improving information and communication for children and adolescents about cancer in the family may help to reduce future problems (<LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Greenly-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Greenly 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christ-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Christ 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greening-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Greening 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor_x002d_Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor-Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kristjanson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjanson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulcahey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulcahey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Compas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 1997</LINK>). A range of different methods have been used to enhance information provision and communication for children and/or adolescents about a parent's, sibling's or grandparent's cancer. These include printed information materials (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1988</LINK>), combined cancer education and psychosocial support programs (<LINK REF="STD-Adams_x002d_Greenly-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Adams-Greenly 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hoke 1997</LINK>), counseling (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1997</LINK>), family-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bakke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakke 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 1997</LINK>), structured sibling group programs (<LINK REF="STD-Kinrade-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kinrade 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor_x002d_Brown-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor-Brown 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bedway-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bedway 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>), art and play therapy (<LINK REF="STD-MacEvoy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MacEvoy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourkes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sourkes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1993</LINK>), music therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Slivka-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Slivka 1986</LINK>), and bereavement support interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Christ-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Christ 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulcahey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulcahey 1995</LINK>). We conducted a systematic review of the effects of these interventions.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and controlled and uncontrolled before and after studies (studies that compare pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments) that evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at improving communication with children and/or adolescents about a family member's cancer at any stage of the disease or treatment process.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children and/or adolescents with a parent, a sibling or a grandparent diagnosed with cancer. The definition of childhood and adolescence can vary. We were as inclusive as possible and defined it as up to and including 18 years of age. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the majority of participants fell into this age group. </P>
<P>Children and/or adolescents whose parent, sibling or grandparent is in long-term remission from cancer (i.e. 'survivors' of cancer) were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any intervention aimed at improving communication between health professionals and others (for example, parents and school teachers) and children and/or adolescents about a parent's, sibling's or a grandparent's cancer (for example, through conversation, play, storytelling, art, etc.) in regards to the disease, its treatment and the implications. The interventions might aim to improve routine communication between health professionals and patients' siblings (for example by communication skills training, or by introducing new tools or techniques such as visual aids or puppets into routine discussions) or they might be interventions in addition to routine communication (for example additional discussion sessions, educational social programs, or access to informational resources). </P>

<P>One review author pre-screened all identified titles and abstracts for relevance. Two authors assessed relevant studies for inclusion independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>A systematic approach to data extraction was used to produce a descriptive summary of evaluative studies of methods of enhancing communicating with children or adolescents about a family member's cancer and/or its treatment. One review author extracted the relevant data from the included studies. A second author checked the data extraction. Data extracted about participants included age, setting, diagnosis and stage of disease and treatment of the family member with cancer. Data extracted about interventions included aims, content, timing, duration and frequency. Data extracted about outcomes focused on timing, type of outcome and instruments used to measure the outcomes. We contacted study authors for clarification where necessary.</P>
<P>The following aspects of methodological quality were assessed for all included studies: study design, methods of recruitment of participants, participants' awareness of the study, method of allocation, numbers of patients involved in the studies, proportion of participants followed up, method of analysis and whether a power calculation was carried out. One review author assessed methodological quality and a second review author checked the assessments.</P>
<P>We prepared tabular summaries of extracted data. We present a narrative overview of the findings, grouped according to intervention type.</P>
<P>A review advisory panel was set up to ensure the scientific validity and relevance of the original (1999, unpublished) review. To ensure that patient views and perspectives are represented in the review, the advisory panel included a cancer patient and consumer advocacy organisations in the United Kingdom, including Cancer BACUP, The National Cancer Alliance, the Consumers' Advisory Group for Clinical Trials (CAG-CT), and the Standing Advisory Group on Consumer Involvement in the NHS R&amp;D Programme. Review advisory panel members were invited to comment on both the protocol and a draft of the review.</P>

Four before and after studies evaluated: a structured group intervention (including facilitated group discussion, art therapy, role play and informal social interaction) (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>); a structured educational and support group intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>); a psychosocial sibling support program (<LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>); and a camping program with recreational, educational and psychosocial support components (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>). Detailed information about the interventions used in each study is given in the table of Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All the studies recruited both children and adolescents, with an age range from 6 to 17 years (except <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>: 7-18 years). One study recruited siblings of patients treated at a paediatric oncology centre (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>), one recruited siblings of patients treated at a children's hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>), one recruited siblings of children with chronic illness, including cancer, treated at a university affiliated medical centre (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>), one recruited siblings of children with cancer, treated at a university affiliated medical centre (<LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>), and one recruited siblings of patients treated at several paediatric oncology centres, who were attending a five-day residential camp program (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>). Detailed information about the participants in each study is given in the table of Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes evaluated included social adjustment (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>), knowledge and understanding of siblings' cancer, feelings, attitudes and mood state (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>), perceptions of siblings' cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>), and siblings' level of anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The validity of the measures used to assess psychological, social and behavioural outcomes in particular sometimes received little or no comment in the study reports. Their use in previous studies was often cited as the justification for their usage (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>). One study used the intervention recommended by the American Group Psychotherapy Association (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>). It is not clear how appropriate some of the psychological measures are for young people with cancer. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK> reports on the authors' detailed consideration as to the appropriateness of the measures used.<BR/>
<BR/>None of the included studies explicitly set out to measure harms or adverse effects as distinct outcomes. One study asked for feedback on the 'disadvantages' of the structured group intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>). One study measured the 'personal impact' of the intervention through a post-intervention questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>). All the outcome measures were capable of showing negative as well as positive changes.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:21:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The following aspects of methodological quality were assessed for all included studies: study design, methods of recruitment of participants, participants' awareness of the study, method of allocation, numbers of participants involved in the studies, proportion of participants followed up, method of analysis and whether a power calculation was carried out.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>) used uncontrolled before and after designs. One typical problem with these study designs is that it is hard to be confident that any differences in scores before and after the intervention are due to the effects of the intervention itself: the scores might have changed over time anyway, even if the intervention had not been used. A fifth study used a non-randomised controlled before and after design (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of recruitment</HEADING>
<P>All the studies included in the review explained how they recruited participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants' awareness of study</HEADING>
<P>Three studies obtained consent from siblings' parents and the consent or assent of siblings (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>). One study reported obtaining consent from parents only (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>). One study did not state that informed consent was obtained from either the siblings or their parents, but did state that information about the program was sent to the parents and the children, with the invitation to take part in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Method of allocation</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>), siblings living beyond a 60-mile radius of the treatment center formed the control group. The other four studies did not have control groups and so this criteria is not applicable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Numbers of participants involved in the studies</HEADING>
<P>The total number of participants ranged from 14 to 150 across all five studies. All the studies were single centre, although one recruited from multiple sources (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Proportion of participants followed up</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies reported the proportion of participants followed up for assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>), although proportions are implied in the other studies. Proportions varied between 63% and 100%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of analysis</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies explicitly reported an intention to treat approach to statistical analysis, although two studies appear to have included in the analysis all participants who received the interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:36:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>One non-randomised controlled before and after study (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>) and four uncontrolled before and after studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>) were included in the review. They compared a variety of interventions among different populations and measured different outcomes. The results for each type of intervention are presented separately and a summary of statistical results is presented in the Other Data table. The studies have been grouped according to intervention type.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Structured group interventions</HEADING>
<P>Four studies evaluated structured group interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>). Two assessed knowledge and understanding. <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK> found that participants were significantly more knowledgeable after participating in six group sessions (mean scores: before = 16.00 (SD 8.79), after = 25.83 (SD 5.98), P &lt; 0.000). <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK> also found significant increases in participants' knowledge and understanding after attending an unspecified number of educational and support group sessions (mean scores: before = 60.62% (SD 18.59), after = 82.67% (SD 12.88), t = 7.07, P = 0.0001). Of the three studies that assessed psychosocial outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK> found significant reductions in interpersonal problems (mean scores: before = 16.04 (SD 5.76), after = 11.39 (SD 4.95), p&lt;0.001), intrapsychic (i.e., self) preoccupation (before = 9.77 (SD 3.51), after = 5.63 (SD 2.45), P &lt; 0.000) and disease related communication (before = 6.52 (SD 2.34), after = 8.26 (SD 3.59), P &lt; 0.000). The same study found significantly more positive mood states after the intervention (Sibling-Report: before = 3.22 (SD 11.00), after=14.78 (SD 6.75), P &lt; 0.000; Parent-Report: before= -3.43 (SD 10.39), after = 18.19 (SD 6.92), P &lt; 0.000). <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>, using a before and after design, found that the mean anxiety score before group participation (37.08) was significantly higher than after group participation (33.25) for the whole group of siblings (t =3,49; df 23; p 0.002). The majority of the siblings experienced relatively high anxiety scores before group participation: 18 siblings (75%) had anxiety scores in the 8-10th decile. After group participation, the number of siblings in the higher deciles was smaller: 11 siblings (46%). <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>, using a controlled design, found no significant difference in social adjustment between the intervention and control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Camp program</HEADING>
<P>Using an uncontrolled before and after design, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>) assessed changes in participants' knowledge and understanding, coping, adjustment and wellbeing after attending a specialised camping program. Significant increases in knowledge were found in 2/8 (25%) items on the Identification of Procedures and Therapies subscale (P &lt; 0.02) and in 2/8 (25%) items on the Instrumental Understanding subscale (p&lt;0.01). The same study reported significant increases in Identification of Procedures and Therapies, and in Instrumental Understanding for younger-returning campers (approximate average percent correct: before = 60%, after = 70%, P &lt; 0.05) and for older-new campers (before = 70%, after = 80%, P &lt; 0.05). This study also found significant improvements in intrapersonal disease influence (i.e. how the sibling's illness affects the individual well sibling) in 7/7 (100%) items. A significant mean reduction in younger-returning campers' fear of catching their sibling's cancer was found (from 1.27 (SD 1.49) to 0.47 (SD 0.92), P = 0.01). A significant mean reduction was also found in older-new campers' perceptions of their friends' fears of catching their brother's or sister's cancer (from 0.63 (SD 0.89) to 0.19 (SD 0.40), P = 0.04). However, younger-returning campers' perceptions associated with their friends' fears of catching their brother's or sister's cancer increased (from 0.53 (SD 0.92) to 1.20 (SD 1.21), P = 0.03). Parents reported significant improvements in behaviour in 2/8 (25%) positive behaviour items (P &lt; 0.05) and in 4/6 (67%) negative behaviour items (P &lt; 0.00). Participants themselves reported improvements in 3/8 (38%) positive mood items, (P &lt; 0.02) and in 4/6 (67%) negative mood items (P &lt; 0.00). Parents also reported significant improvements in positive mood states in 2/8 (25%) items (P &lt; 0.05) and significant improvements in negative mood states in 4/6 (67%) items (P &lt; 0.00). Campers themselves reported significant improvements in positive mood states in 3/8 (38%) items (p&lt;0.02) and significant improvements in negative mood states in 4/6 (67%) items (P &lt; 0.00).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-08 15:22:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Only five studies were found to satisfy the inclusion criteria of this review. Their findings are difficult to interpret due to (a) inherent problems with the design of individual studies, and (b) because they are heterogeneous in terms of their aims, study designs, interventions, outcomes, assessment instruments, participants and methods of analysis. The evidence they have produced is weak and inconclusive.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Problems with study designs and methods</HEADING>
<P>All the studies involved complex interventions in that they had multiple components, could be tailored to individual circumstances, and would depend on the characteristics of the individuals who delivered them. For example, in one study a series of six group sessions were held, each addressing a different problem area and using a combination of discussion, art therapy, role play and informal social interaction (<LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>). It is impossible to discern which components, or combination of components, had an effect.</P>
<P>The improved outcomes reported in uncontrolled before and after studies may be effects of the passage of time and unrelated to the interventions tested. It is difficult to interpret the results of controlled studies if the groups are not compatible at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1990</LINK>, the intervention and control groups were not compatible at baseline inasmuch as those receiving the intervention lived nearby their sibling's treatment centre, whereas those in the control group lived beyond a 60 mile radius. The researchers assumed that there was no substantial difference between those siblings who lived near to and those who lived far away from the treatment centre. This assumption may be unjustified as many of the problems experienced by child and adolescent siblings of cancer patients arise directly from their separation from one or both parents and the ill sibling during treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simeon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simeon 1984</LINK>). This separation and its consequences are likely to be exacerbated for siblings of patients who live far away from the treatment centre.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Houtzager-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Houtzager 2001</LINK>, only those patients who were known to have siblings in the relevant age group were contacted, and the dropout rate was high, leading to questions, given the small sample size, about whether it was only those who benefited who were followed up. Further, the high levels of anxiety found before group participation might have been associated with the prospect of group participation itself, rather than more generally. The reported findings might, therefore, tend to overestimate the positive effects of the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other factors affecting interpretation of findings</HEADING>
<P>All the studies recruited participants with relatively wide age ranges. Some studies (for example <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>) applied the same intervention to different age-groups. If the same intervention is given to children of a range of ages, it might be significantly more suitable for some than others, and might have quite different effects on children of different ages. If the findings reported are the aggregate or 'average' effects across all age groups, important differences might be masked. Some studies (such as <LINK REF="STD-Dolgin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dolgin 1997</LINK>) tailor interventions to children of different ages. The findings of these are also difficult to interpret and apply if they do not describe the different version of the interventions given, and present the data for all age groups together.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Range and appropriateness of outcomes assessed</HEADING>
<P>The interventions assessed might impact on a range of processes and outcomes by a variety of mechanisms. Three studies investigated changes in knowledge and understanding and three investigated changes in coping, adjustment and wellbeing, after communication interventions. Other outcomes which could have been assessed include patterns of interaction and perceived quality of relationships within the family, general quality of life and physical health status.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cost considerations</HEADING>
<P>The costs of the interventions also need to be considered. None of the reviewed studies contained economic evaluations. Future researchers may wish to evaluate the separate elements of the camping intervention described in <LINK REF="STD-Sahler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sahler 1989</LINK>, to determine whether the findings could be replicated in less resource-intensive interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There have been few reported studies which have evaluated the effects of interventions to enhance communication for children and adolescents about a family member's cancer and its treatment. There is weak evidence to suggest that some interventions, such as structured group interventions, may lead to improvements in knowledge and understanding, in coping, anxiety, adjustment and wellbeing. In the absence of more robust empirical evidence about the effects of particular interventions, health practitioners must use their own individual judgement about how better communication with these groups might be achieved. Whatever approaches are tried, decisions about communicating with children and adolescents might take into account a range of factors. These include the family member's medical condition (especially their prognosis), the healthy child or adolescent's levels of cognitive, emotional and physical development, readiness and ability to communicate, and with whom they prefer to communicate concerns about their family member's cancer and treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is needed to investigate the effects of different methods of enhancing communication with children and/or adolescents about a family member's cancer and its treatment. Interventions should be underpinned by relevant psychological and sociological theory and by research that clarifies the needs and preferences of healthy children and adolescents and their ill family member. Choice of interventions should also be informed by a knowledge of the wide range of approaches, from formal education to the expressive arts, which have been used but not properly evaluated. In addition, studies could usefully evaluate the impact of interventions with children and adolescents when family members other than siblings (such as parents) develop cancer. </P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF/>
<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>This review was originally conducted in 1999 as a partner review to "Interventions for improving communication with children and adolescents about their cancer". The review was completed (with four included studies) and submitted to the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group for editorial and peer review comment. Editorial feedback was provided in early 2000 but was never acted upon, and consequently the review remained unpublished. </P>
<P>In late 2002/early 2003, staff at the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group editorial base joined with the original review team to complete and publish the review, by a) addressing the original editorial feedback, b) updating the search strategies and bringing the searches up to date, and c) updating the review accordingly. An additional study was included. The updated review also received a round of editorial feedback from the current editorial team of the Consumers and Communication Review Group. <BR/>

<P>Aims: to give siblings the opportunity to know more about their sibling's cancer and to be able to interact with peers in a similar situation and with professional staff experienced in counselling.</P>
<P>To assess the effect of repeated instruction on siblings' medical information, campers were grouped (a) according to whether they had previously attendedthe camping programme (new or return), and (b) into younger (6- to 11-years) and older (12- to 17-years) groups. This produced four groups: younger-returning campers (n = 15), younger-new campers (n = 33), older-returning campers (n=26) and older-new campers (n = 16). Recreation is the major component of Camp B&amp;ST but the camp is designed to provide siblings with medical information and peer support. Each camper attended a small-group 1-hour medical information session, led by a paediatric oncologist and an oncology nurse specialist. In order to provide age-appropriate instruction, campers were divided into 2 age groups (6 to 11 and 12 to 17). The sessions were experiential seminars and included opportunities to see and handle medical equipment and to ask questions. Various medical terms (eg. blood counts), procedures (eg. spinal tap) and therapies (eg. chemotherapy) were defined and simulated, and their function in the management of childhood cancer explained.</P>
<P>Campers also attended a group psychosocial support session. Groups were composed of campers of similar ages and further divided into groups of campers whose ill sibling was still alive and campers who were bereaved. Sessions were preceded by skits, staged by a theatre group, depicting common themes in families with childhood cancer (eg. parents not having time to attend a school play with a healthy sibling). Following each vignette, "in character" discussions to clarify feelings occurred between the actors and the audience.</P>
<P>N = (baseline) 141.</P>

<P>Anxiety was measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). The mean anxiety score before group participation (37.08) was significantly higher than after group participation (33.25) for the whole group of siblings (t =3,49; df 23; p 0.002). The majority of the siblings had high anxiety scores before group participation: 18 siblings (75%) had anxiety scores in the 8-10th decile. These reduced after group participation: 11 siblings (46%). Examination of changes in deciles showed: for 12 siblings (50%) there was a decrease in decile and for 11 siblings (46%), the decile score remains the same. One sibling (4%) had an increased decile score. <BR/>
<BR/>Before group participation, the boys as well as girls in the younger age group (7-12) and adolescent boys (13-18) had significantly higher mean anxiety scores than would be expected from the norms (p &lt; 0.05). For boys in both age groups, anxiety scores droped to a normal level again after group participation. For young girls, anxiety decreased after group participation, but remained significantly higher than in the norm group. For the adolescent girls, both before and after group participation, the level of anxiety experienced was comparable to that of their norm group.<BR/>
<BR/>T-tests showed that sibling age and the survival perspective of the ill child were not related to the differential anxiety scores. Time since diagnosis showed no significant correlation with the differential anxiety score (r =0.34; p 0.10; n 24). Type of diagnosis appeared to have a significant effect on the differential anxiety score in the regression analysis. The anxiety of siblings of children with leukemia or lymphoma decreased more after group participation than in siblings of children with a solid tumor or a brain tumor. There was no effect of being in or off treatment. Neither was in or off treatment a confounder for the effect of diagnosis.</P>
