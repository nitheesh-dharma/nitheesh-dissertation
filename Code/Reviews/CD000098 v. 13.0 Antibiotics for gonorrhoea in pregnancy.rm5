<P>Pregnant women with gonorrhoea who take penicillin, spectinomycin or ceftriaxone are much less likely to show signs of infection.</P>
<P>Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacteria transmitted (passed) during sex, causing an infection in the genital area. Pregnant women with gonorrhoea may pass the infection to babies during birth. This can affect the baby's eyesight, causing blindness. The review of two trials, involving 346 women, found evidence that pregnant women who take penicillin, spectinomycin, ceftriaxone or cefixime are much less likely to have signs of gonorrhoea a week to 10 days later. Further research is needed to find out which antibiotic treatment is the best for preventing infection of the baby.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-01-03 14:13:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be transmitted from the mother's genital tract to the newborn during birth and can cause gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum as well as systemic neonatal infection. It can also cause endometritis and pelvic sepsis in the mother.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic regimens in the treatment of genital infection with gonorrhoea during pregnancy with respect to neonatal and maternal morbidity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-03 14:11:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2009) and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. We updated this search on 3 January 2012; no new trials identified.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized trials of one regimen of antibiotic versus another in pregnant women with culture confirmed genital gonococcal infection.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials involving 346 women were included. The only outcome included in these trials was the incidence of 'cure' assessed by bacterial culture. Failure to achieve 'microbiological cure' was similar for each antibiotic regimen: amoxicillin plus probenecid compared with spectinomycin (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 7.08), amoxicillin plus probenecid compared with ceftriaxone (Peto OR 2.29, 95% CI 0.74 to 7.08) and ceftriaxone compared with cefixime (Peto OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.16 to 9.01). Side-effects were uncommon for all the tested regimens.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-03 14:13:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of women included in each of the comparisons is small and therefore, although no differences were detected between the different antibiotic regimens, the trials were limited in their ability to detect important but modest differences.

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-18 11:39:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Neisseria gonorrhoea causes a sexually transmitted infection which, although uncommon in developed countries, is a major public health issue in many developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laga-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laga 1986</LINK>). Gonorrhoea in pregnancy has been associated with prelabour rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery, although this relationship may be casual rather than causal (<LINK REF="REF-Amstey-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amstey 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be transmitted from the mother's genital tract to the neonate at the time of delivery and occasionally, when there is prolonged rupture of the membranes, it can be transmitted to the fetus before birth. The usual manifestation of neonatal infection is gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. The risk of transmission from an infected mother is between 30% and 47% (<LINK REF="REF-Fransen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galega-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galega 1984</LINK>). Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum begins in the first few days of life, is manifest by a profuse purulent conjunctival discharge and is frequently bilateral. If left untreated, this infection will eventually lead to blindness although the risk of blindness has not been accurately quantified. Occasionally the neonate may develop gonococcal infection elsewhere such as gonococcal arthritis.</P>
<P>In the postpartum period gonorrhoea can cause endometritis and pelvic sepsis in the mother, which may be severe.</P>
<P>Gonorrhoea was one of the first infections to be treated with penicillin in the 1940s and there have been no randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of penicillin for people with symptomatic gonorrhoea. Penicillin continues to be used for the treatment of gonorrhoea in pregnancy in most countries which have a low incidence of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG). However, for women who are sensitive to penicillin or who are infected with PPNG, there is uncertainty as to what is the most effective antibiotic therapy.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine what antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of genital infection with gonorrhoea in pregnancy. Any antibiotic will be compared with penicillin. If there are sufficient trials, these will be stratified into groups of similar antibiotics compared with penicillin. In addition, any trials of alternative antibiotics comparisons will be included to determine their relative effectiveness, or at least suggest which comparisons may be useful to investigate in future trials.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Two trials involving 346 women were included. All the tested antibiotic regimens demonstrated a high level of effectiveness as judged by 'microbiological cure', with eradication rates of between 89% and 97%. Failure to achieve 'microbiological cure' was similar for each antibiotic regimen: amoxicillin plus probenecid compared with spectinomycin (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 7.08), amoxicillin plus probenecid compared with ceftriaxone (Peto OR 2.29, 95% CI 0.74 to 7.08) and ceftriaxone compared with cefixime (Peto OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.16 to 9.01). There is no convincing evidence that any one of the tested antibiotic regimens is superior to the treatments with which they were compared. The number of women included in each of the comparisons is small and therefore, although no differences were detected between the different antibiotic regimens, the trials were limited in their ability to detect important but modest differences. </P>
<P>There appear to be few side-effects associated with any of the tested regimens. No women in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ramus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramus 2001</LINK> reported any side-effects sufficient to stop treatment and the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Cavenee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cavenee 1993</LINK> reported that only one woman in the whole trial reported vomiting after treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of treating gonorrhoea during pregnancy is to eradicate the infection and therefore prevent the consequences of that infection. These consequences will include neonatal infection, postpartum sepsis for the mother and the consequences of transmission to sexual partners. 'Microbiological cure' is used in these trials as an alternative measure of eradication of infection, the assumption being that 'microbiological cure' equals eradication and no subsequent neonatal or maternal disease. This assumption may not be true, however, and the extent to which it is not true may vary between the different antibiotics being compared. Thus, if both agents appear to be equally effective in terms of their effect on 'microbiological cure', there may still be differences in their effect on more substantive outcome measures such as ophthalmia neonatorum. Neither trial reported any substantive outcome measures.</P>
<P>The concept that genital cultures may not accurately reflect whether a woman is or is not infected with gonorrhoea is supported by findings from both of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cavenee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cavenee 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramus-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ramus 2001</LINK>). In these trials, women were referred to a specialist clinic because they had culture evidence of genital gonococcal infection. These women then had repeat cultures taken and only 68% to 76% of the original group had evidence of gonorrhoea on a second sample. This may reflect spontaneous cure or it may reflect the inaccuracy of genital cultures as a method of detecting women who are infected. Either way, it is possible that evidence of 'microbiological cure' may be a less reliable outcome measure than has been assumed and evidence that there were no or few episodes of disease in the neonates or the mothers postnatally would have been more reassuring.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-03 14:13:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review suggests that any of the antibiotic regimens tested in these trials may be suitable for the treatment of gonorrhoea in pregnancy in terms of their effect on 'microbiological cure'. There is a suggestion that amoxicillin with probenecid may be a little less effective than spectinomycin or ceftriaxone although the numbers in the trials are too small to state this with confidence.</P>
<P>For women who are allergic to penicillin this review provides reassurance that treatment with ceftriaxone or spectinomycin is at least as equally effective in producing 'microbiological cure'. The two trials did not include populations with a high prevalence of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains and little can be concluded about the relative effectiveness of these antibiotic regimens in such populations.</P>
<P>When comparing two non-penicillin antibiotics, the only direct comparison which has been made is a comparison between ceftriaxone and cefixime. This suggested little difference in terms of their effectiveness but once again the numbers involved are small. A conclusive demonstration that the two drugs are equally effective would be of interest in that one is given orally and one by intramuscular injection.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-03 14:13:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any further trials of antibiotic treatment for gonorrhoea in pregnancy should include more substantive outcome measures.</P>
<P>Similarly, information about side-effects should be collected and clearly presented, particularly when assessing the relative merits of two different antibiotics. If the drugs seem to be equally effective, there may be differences in their side-effect profile which would favour the adoption of one drug over the other and, without this information, the clinician is left uncertain about which policy to adopt.</P>
<P>Finally, the association between genital gonococcal infection and adverse perinatal outcome in terms of prelabour rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery merits further investigation. The evidence to date is entirely observational and the assumption that early detection and treatment of gonorrhoea in pregnancy will alter subsequent perinatal outcome requires testing in randomized controlled trials.</P>
