<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-01 14:19:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common mental disorder characterised by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy pleasurable activities. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life.</P>
<P>Antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment for major depression in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care in some countries. This systematic review investigated the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran compared to that of other antidepressive agents in the acute phase treatment of major depression. A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (2277 participants) were included in this review. When we brought together the results of approximately 2000 patients, we were unable to say whether milnacipran is better, worse or the same when compared to other antidepressive agents used in practice in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. However, there is some evidence that fewer people taking milnacipran stop taking the drug ('drop out') due to side effects and fewer people taking milnacipran experience side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth or constipation than do people who take tricyclic antidepressants.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 18:17:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta-analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 20:09:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost-effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 18:22:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common metal disorder characterised by a combination of persistent symptoms (including depressed mood, loss of interest, loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, extreme guilt and suicide ideation) that interfere with a person's ability to work, study and enjoy pleasurable activities (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Compared with other medical diagnoses, depression is very common. Lifetime prevalence estimates for major depression in the community range from 15 to 17% (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>), 12-month prevalence from 6 to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2003</LINK>). The prevalence of major depression in the medical outpatient is 5 to 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Coyne-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 1994</LINK>). Major depression is the third leading cause of burden among all diseases after lower respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases, accounting for 4.3% of human suffering in terms of illhealth; moreover, it is expected to show a rising trend during the coming 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). This condition is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). In the USA, the economic burden of depression has been estimated at just over $83 billion in 2000, of which $26 billion were direct treatment costs, $5 billion were suicide-related costs, and $52 billion were workplace costs (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2003</LINK>). It is also suspected that these figures are still underestimates of the true economic burden of the disease, which may in addition involve burden on family members and caregivers, the cost of lost productivity while at work, and cost associated with those who remain untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 18:23:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) (see below for other references to the relevant evidence). Amongst ADs many different agents are available, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs: venlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran), and other newer agents (mirtazapine, reboxetine, bupropion). In many western countries, during the last 20 years, ADs consumption has dramatically risen, mainly because of the increasing consumption of SSRIs and newer ADs, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2005</LINK>). SSRIs are generally better tolerated than TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2007</LINK>), and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparisons provide contrasting findings. Amitriptyline, for example, may have the edge over SSRIs in terms of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Guaiana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guaiana 2007</LINK>), and individual SSRIs and SNRIs may differ in terms of efficacy and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-05-11 17:02:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Milnacipran has been available as an antidepressant since 1997 in many countries including France and Japan (34 countries and regions as of 2006). Milnacipran appears to act exclusively at presynaptic sites to inhibit noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and serotonin uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Moret-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moret 1985</LINK>), but unlike TCAs, has no significant effect on any neurotransmitter receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Briley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briley 1996</LINK>). Thus, compared with TCAs, milnacipran has shown a lower incidence of anticholinergic-like side effects, less sedation due to histamine H1-receptor binding and lower incidence of postural hypotension due to alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonism (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1998</LINK>). The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug indicates that milnacipran has a high bioavailability, low plasma protein binding (13%) and is mostly eliminated in urine: 50% as the unchanged drug, 30% as a glucuronide (main metabolite) and the remaining 20% by oxidative transformation (<LINK REF="REF-Puozzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puozzo 1996</LINK>). Milnacipran does not affect the activities of CYP-2D6, 2C19, 1A2 and 3A4 isoforms, and its pharmacokinetics are not modified in poor metabolizers of CYP-2D6 and CYP-2C9 (<LINK REF="REF-Puozzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puozzo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawada-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawada 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puozzo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puozzo 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, studies in patients with liver dysfunction suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary or to be minor when milnacipran is administered to these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Puozzo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puozzo 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-05-11 17:04:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that the most recent available evidence refers to the SSRIs as an homogeneous group (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2005</LINK>), it is still unclear how each newer antidepressive agent compares with other antidepressants in terms of effects and adverse events. A group of researchers therefore agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Multiple meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants (MANGA) Study to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer antidepressant.</P>
<P>In terms of milnacipran, only limited evidence has been established regarding the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in comparison with other antidepressive agents, to date. Some RCTs have reported that milnacipran has an antidepressant efficacy similar to other antidepressants, such as imipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Tignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Amerongen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Amerongen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Ibor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Ibor 2004</LINK>), clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Leinonen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leinonen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 1997</LINK>), fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Guelfi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guelfi 1998</LINK>), fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="STD-Clerc-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Clerc 2001</LINK>) and paroxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Sechter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sechter 2004</LINK>). In a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Puech-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puech 1997</LINK>), milnacipran has shown superior antidepressant efficacy in comparison with SSRIs and the tolerability has been comparable to that of the SSRIs. However, this review was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company marketing milnacipran and was published more than a decade ago. Therefore, there is a good reason to conduct an up-to-date comprehensive systematic quantitative review using currently best-available evidence on comparative efficacy and adverse effects of milnacipran against other antidepressive agents.</P>
<P>The primary objective of this systematic review is to assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with TCAs, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents, including non-conventional agents, in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.</P>

<P>Patients aged 18 or older, of both sexes with a primary diagnosis of major depression.

ICD-9 is not operationalised criteria, because it has only disease names and no diagnostic criteria, so studies using ICD-9 were excluded. On the other hand, studies using Feighner Criteria or Research Diagnostic Criteria were included. We included the following depression subtypes: chronic, with catatonic features, with melancholic features, with atypical features, with postpartum onset, and with seasonal pattern. Studies in which less than 20% of the participants may be suffering from bipolar depression were included. A concurrent secondary diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered as exclusion criteria.</P>

<P>Studies relating to milnacipran generated by the search strategies of the CCDANCTR-References and the other complementary searches were checked by the CCDAN Trial Search Coordinator (HMG), who is an author of this review, and another independent review author (AN and NW) to see if they met the inclusion criteria, firstly based on the title and abstracts. All the studies rated as possible candidates by either of the two reviewers (AN and NW) were added to the preliminary list and their full texts were retrieved. All the full text articles in this preliminary list were then assessed by two review authors (AN and NW) independently to see if they met strict inclusion criteria. If the raters disagreed the final rating was made by consensus with the involvement (if necessary) of another member of the review group. Non-congruence in selection of trials were reported as percentage disagreement. Considerable care was taken to exclude duplicate publications.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-05-12 18:27:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool as recommended in RevMan 5.0.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>). This instrument consists of six items. Two of the items assess the strength of the randomisation process in preventing selection bias in the assignment of participants to interventions: adequacy of sequence generation and allocation concealment. The third item (blinding) assesses the influence of performance bias on the study results. The fourth item assesses the likelihood of incomplete outcome data, which raise the possibility of bias in effect estimates. The fifth item assesses selective reporting, the tendency to preferentially report statistically significant outcomes. It requires a comparison of published data with trial protocols, when such are available. The final item refers to other sources of bias that are relevant in certain circumstances, for example, in relation to trial design (methodological issues such as those related to crossover designs and early trial termination) or setting.</P>
<P>Two independent review authors (AN and NW) assessed risk of bias in each trial independently, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>).

<P>Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: drop-outs were always included in this analysis. Where participants had withdrawn from the trial before the endpoint, it was assumed they would have experienced the negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). When there were missing data and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) were been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. When dichotomous or continuous outcomes were not reported, trial authors were asked to supply these data.</P>

<P>Outcome concerning efficacy during acute phase treatment (6-12 weeks) were obtained from ten studies (n=1565). Of the ten studies, six studies were assessed at 6 weeks, 3 at 8 weeks and one at 12 weeks. Efficacy data during early phase were obtained from 13 studies (n=1934), and in 11 studies were assessed at two weeks. All studies used intention to treat analyses based on the last observation carried forward method for the efficacy outcome. Either 17, 21 or 24-item HAM-D were used to evaluate the efficacy data for all the studies included in the review.The data reporting of most studies were incomplete even after supplementing the provided data from contacted two authors (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shinkai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shinkai 2004</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 18:50:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in this review. Milnacipran does not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, the data from one trial suggest that milnacipran may be inferior in terms of response compared to clomipramine (OR0.45, 95%CI: 0.21 to 0.98). Further, compared with TCAs, intervention groups including patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer patients leaving the trial early due to adverse events as compared to patients taking TCAs (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). There was also small amount of evidence that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation, as compared with those taking TCAs.</P>
<P>The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Also ,only a small number of trials per comparison were found for most of the antidepressants. This limits the power of the review to detect moderate but clinically meaningful differences between the antidepressive agents.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 18:52:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has long been argued that placebo controlled trials are required to adequately demonstrate the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 2002</LINK>), however, in the present review we focused only on the comparison between milnacipran and other active treatments for two reasons. First, in this review we focused on the following important clinical matter: "When an milnacipran is to be prescribed, would it constitute the better choice ?" </P>
<P>To answer this question within a clinically sound perspective, we included studies with active treatment comparisons. Second, placebo-controlled studies are different from active comparator trials in terms of design, conduct and population, and furthermore it has been shown that placebo response in published trials of antidepressant drug for major depressive disorder is highly variable and often substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2002</LINK>). Retrieved randomised evidence compared milnacipran with a small selection of possible comparator antidepressants and no trials comparing milnacipran with escitalopram or citalopram (amongst SSRIs), or with venlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, reboxetine or hypericum (amongst the newer antidepressive agents), or with some of the first generation antidepressants (such as MAOIs) were found. Although the search was comprehensive and thorough, it is still possible that there are unpublished studies that have not been identified but the small number of trials identified per comparison hinders the detection of any publication bias. </P>
<P>As in all systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in the present study the main concern is about assessing the studies which were identified. The more information that is pooled together, the more precise and accurate is the estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We are realistically aware that a possibly significant piece of information has not been published and thus is not contributing to the true treatment estimate we were seeking. Although we did our very best to retrieve as many data as possible, through asking pharmaceutical companies and study authors to supply all available information, we can assume that data from some trials are still lacking, most of which are likely to be studies with negative findings. We are also aware of the possibility that a number of further randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant drugs are currently being conducted and these will be included in future updates of the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-05-11 18:54:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some possible limitations of this review should be noted. Firstly, we had to impute the response and remission rates, our primary outcome, for most of the included trials. However, we consider that this is hardly rare, since incomplete reporting of outcome (i.e. an outcome reporting bias) is common within published articles of randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>). Further, imputation of response and remission rates by a validated statistical method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>) in our review should minimize those biases. Nevertheless, we regret that we were unable to do a sensitivity analysis excluding trials with imputed response rates. As we update this review and assemble more trials involving milnacipran, we hope to conduct such a sensitivity analysis and be able to examine if our conclusions are robust. </P>
<P>Secondly, high dropout rates reduce the reliability of the assessment of other outcomes. Further, by making multiple comparisons we might have committed a type 1 error, that is, identifying and reporting a spurious association. Thirdly, all but one of the included trials had been funded by the drug company marketing milnacipran. There is nothing inherently wrong or biasing in this but, in view of the overwhelming evidence that sponsorship bias exists not only in psychiatry (<LINK REF="REF-Heres-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heres 2006</LINK>) but also in medicine overall (<LINK REF="REF-Bekelman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekelman 2003</LINK>), we should pay special attention that we may not inadvertently fall prey to such a bias. Therefore, these associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of the current findings.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-05-11 18:57:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venlafaxine, another dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been the first new generation antidepressant to be claimed to have differential effectiveness vis-a-vis the other antidepressants. The superiority of venlafaxine was first demonstrated in a drug company sponsored meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Thase-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thase 2001</LINK>), and subsequently confirmed in an independently conducted meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>). In addition, duloxetine, another SNRI, is also reported to be efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated, safe and effective for the treatment of core depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cowen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowen 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Frampton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frampton 2007</LINK>). In keeping with these findings, milnacipran has been reported to be superior to SSRIs and equal to TCAs in two drug company sponsored meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Puech-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puech 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Ibor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Ibor 1996</LINK>). However, this superiority was not replicated in a subsequent independently-conducted meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Papakostas-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papakostas 2007a</LINK>). Our current review, which has included two additional trials involving SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-Shinkai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shinkai 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2003</LINK>), and seven TCAs trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tignol 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Amerongen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Amerongen 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Ibor-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Ibor 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leinonen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leinonen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Annseau-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Annseau 1989a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Annseau-1989c" TYPE="STUDY">Annseau 1989c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yamashita-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yamashita 1995</LINK>) and one heterocyclic trial (<LINK REF="STD-Endo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Endo 1995</LINK>) since <LINK REF="REF-Papakostas-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papakostas 2007a</LINK>, confirms its findings.</P>
<P>The methodological limitation of standard systematic reviews is that they can rely only on evidence from direct comparisons. However, given the wide spectrum of available comparisons for the treatment of major depression, the use of the methodology of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM, also known as <I>network meta-analysis</I>) may help overcome this limitation (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2004</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Lu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salanti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salanti 2008</LINK>). MTM is a statistical method that enables to integrate data from direct comparisons (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how effective they are against a common comparator treatment) involving diverse regimens, and to assess the strength and consistency of the evidence. MTM has already been used in other fields of medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2007</LINK>), and these comparisons may provide a clinically useful summary that can be used to guide treatment decisions. In the field of major depression, we have recently published a MTM including our data for milnacipran to compare both direct and indirect effects of 12 new-generation antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>). The corresponding OR with 95%CI for efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (total dropout rate) are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. All of the confidence intervals overlap widely between MTM and direct comparisons, mainly because the confidence intervals of the direct comparisons are wide, generally indicating that the network of evidence is consistent. When the relative ratio of ORs was smaller than 0.59 (vs fluvoxamine and vs sertraline for response), the ORs of the MTM were revealed to be more conservative (i.e. closer to the null result) than the direct comparisons. It is possible that including indirect evidence may have 'cancelled out' the potential biases such as sponsorship and publication biases. The value of MTMs are increasingly acknowledged (<LINK REF="REF-Santaguida-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santaguida 2005</LINK>) along with their pitfalls (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2006</LINK>). Further methodological work is needed to confirm the relevance and validity of the review.</P>

<P>The results of this review suggest that milnacipran is no more or less effective than other antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression. There is also inadequate evidence to detect a substantial difference between milnacipran and other antidepressive agents in terms of acceptability and tolerability.

<P>More randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with other antidepressants are needed to generate more precise and accurate information about the drug. Also, randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with other comparator such as escitalopram, venlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, or hypericum are needed. Furthermore, future studies should focus to a greater extent on outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning. Cost-effectiveness also need to be assessed.</P>
