<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No convincing evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare, chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. Colchicine, a plant alkaloid, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and was tested in randomised clinical trials. When all identified trials were combined, colchicine appeared to be not significantly different from placebo/no intervention in respect to mortality, mortality and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, and the occurrences of adverse events. Colchicine may reduce pruritus, but this finding may be due to bias. The addition of ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly influence the effect of colchicine. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Colchicine has been used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis because of its immunomodulatory and antifibrotic potential. The therapeutical responses to colchicine in randomised clinical trials were inconsistent.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We identified trials through electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>on<I> The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE, EMBASE (September 2003)</I>, and manual searches of bibliographies. We contacted authors of trials and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing colchicine with any kind of control therapy were included irrespective of language, year of publication, and publication status. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The primary outcomes were the number of deaths and the number of death and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined intervention effects by using both a fixed effect model and a random effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eleven randomised clinical trials involving 716 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were detected between colchicine and placebo/no intervention on the number of deaths (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.06), the number of deaths and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.49), liver complications, liver biochemical variables, liver histological measurements, and adverse events. Trial methodology was generally low and some trials had high drop-out rate. A best-worst-case-scenario analysis showed no significant effect of colchicine on mortality (RR 0.59, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.15), while a worst-best-case-scenario analysis showed a significant detrimental effect of colchicine on mortality (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.44). Colchicine significantly decreased the number of patients without improvement of pruritus (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87). However, this estimate was based on only 156 patients from three trials. The effect of the combined treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was not significantly different from that of colchicine alone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We did not find evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. As we are not able to exclude a detrimental effect of colchicine, we suggest that it is only used in randomised clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-24 12:27:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon chronic progressive liver disease of unknown etiology. Ninety per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are females and the majority are diagnosed after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-James-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1981</LINK>). The earlier description was published in 1949 (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1949</LINK>). Later, Ahrens and co-workers comprehensively described primary biliary cirrhosis in 1950 (<LINK REF="REF-Ahrens-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrens 1950</LINK>). A progressive granulomatous hepatitis destroys small septal and interlobular bile ducts, eventually leading to cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis is classically defined on the basis of the triad: antimitochondrial antibodies, which are found in over 95% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fregeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fregeau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacerda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacerda 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Invernizzi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Invernizzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turchany-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turchany 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattalia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattalia 1998</LINK>); abnormal liver function tests that are typically cholestatic (with raised activity of alkaline phosphatases being the most frequently seen abnormality); and characteristic liver histological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>) in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1996</LINK>). Patients may either be diagnosed during a symptomatic phase (the common symptoms being pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, liver enlargement, signs of portal hypertension, sicca complex, and scleroderma-like lesions), in which case survival is significantly decreased, or during an asymptomatic phase of the disease, which has a relatively favourable prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balasubramaniam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasubramaniam 1990</LINK>). However, 40 to 100% of these patients will subsequently develop symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nyberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metcalf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalf 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prince-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although the etiology remains unknown, primary biliary cirrhosis is in many respects analogous to the graft-versus-host syndrome in which the immune system is sensitised to foreign proteins. Most primary biliary cirrhosis patients have increased class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) histocompatibility expression on bile duct cells (<LINK REF="REF-Ballarardini-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballarardini 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Oord-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Oord 1986</LINK>), and the bile duct epithelium is infiltrated by cytotoxic T-cells (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 1986</LINK>). Lacrimal and pancreatic glands, for example, with a high concentration of HLA class II antigens on their epithelium, may be involved in the disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1982</LINK>). </P>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have been subjected to many drugs. Ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid, is the most extensively used drug in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). However, a recent systematic Cochrane Review was unable to demonstrate any significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on mortality or liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2002</LINK>). Over the years, a number of other drugs have been evaluated for primary biliary cirrhosis. Earlier attempts to treat primary biliary cirrhosis using immunomodulatory and other agents such as azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heathcote 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1985</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>), chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1986</LINK>), cyclosporine (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1990</LINK>), D-penicillamine (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matloff-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matloff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1985</LINK>), methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1995</LINK>), or colchicine have resulted in clinical effects that have not led to widespread acceptance of these drugs for primary biliary cirrhosis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Colchicine is a plant alkaloid. It is effective against gouty arthritis and other forms of rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, Bechet's disease, etc.) (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Chetrit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Chetrit 1998</LINK>). The basis for effect of colchicine is inhibition of the migration of granulocytes into inflamed areas and decreased metabolic and phagocytic activity of granulocytes. Further, colchicine is an anti-mitotic (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 1998</LINK>) and anti-fibrotic agent. Colchicine retards the microtubule mediated transport of procollagen (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1972</LINK>) and enhances collagenase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1971</LINK>). </P>
<P>Colchicine has been used for primary biliary cirrhosis patients because of its immunomodulatory and antifibrotic potential. Colchicine has been reported to slow the rate of progression of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1997</LINK>) and to produce improvements in liver function tests and immunoglobulin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Warnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1999</LINK>). However, colchicine does not affect clinical symptoms or liver histology (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>). The effect of combination therapy with colchicine and ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported, but the results have been conflicting (<LINK REF="STD-Shibata-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ikeda-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ikeda 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poupon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poupon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almasio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Almasio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Battezzati-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battezzati 2001</LINK>). We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis patients.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, i.e., patients having at least two of the following: elevated serum activity of alkaline phosphatases (or other markers of intrahepatic cholestasis), and/or a positive result for serum mitochondrial antibody, and/or liver biopsy findings diagnostic for or compatible with primary biliary cirrhosis. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Administration of any dose of colchicine versus placebo or no intervention or other drugs. Co-interventions were allowed as long as all intervention arms of the randomised clinical trial received similar co-interventions. Therefore, we analysed the following comparisons:<BR/>1) Colchicine versus placebo/no intervention (monotherapy). <BR/>2) Colchicine plus ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo/no intervention plus ursodeoxycholic acid (combination therapy).<BR/>3) Colchicine versus other drugs.</P>

<P>Relevant randomised clinical trials were identified by searching <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (September 2003), <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 3, 2003), <I>MEDLINE</I> (January 1966 to September 2003), and <I>EMBASE</I> (January 1980 to September 2003). See '<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>' for the search strategies that were applied to the individual electronic databases.</P>
<P>Further trials were identified by reading the reference lists of the identified studies.

</B>YG extracted the data and CG validated the data extraction. Disagreements were solved by discussion. YG wrote to the authors of all the included trials on colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis and asked them to specify data, had they not been reported clearly in the articles.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included trials<BR/>
</B>The methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was assessed using four components (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>):</P>
<P>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice will be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure;</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described;</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. These studies are known as quasi-randomised and were excluded from the present review.</LI>

</B>All outcomes were extracted from each included trial when possible.</P>
<P>We analysed mortality and/or liver transplantation at maximum follow-up. We analysed other outcomes, which were repeatedly observed on patients (like liver biochemistry, clinical symptoms, etc.) at maximum follow-up. However, where possible, we also extracted data on primary outcome measures from the maximal follow-up in each randomised clinical trial, and if available, including data from after the patients were switched from blinded to open label therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>We used RevMan Analyses 1.0.1 provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. Dichotomous data were presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous outcomes were presented by weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. The analyses for the primary outcomes were performed according to the intention-to-treat analyses, which means that the participants in the trials were to be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received or adhered to the allocated intervention. We computed a 'reported scenario' analysis. However, we placed most weight on the 'likely scenario' analysis (see Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses below).</P>
<P>We examined intervention effects by using both a fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) and a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) with the level of significance set at P &#8804; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, only the result of the fixed effect model analysis was given in the text. In case of significant discrepancies of the two models, results from both models were reported and discussed. The presence of statistical heterogeneity was explored by the chi-squared test with significance set at P &#8804; 0.10 and measured the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses<BR/>We performed subgroup analyses, in which trials were grouped according to the stage of disease; duration of treatment; adequacy of generation of the allocation sequence; allocation concealment; blinding; and whether the trial reported used intention-to-treat analysis. The cut-off for duration of treatment was determined by comparing the intervention effect of the group of trials lasting for no more than the median treatment duration with that of the group of trials lasting for more than the median duration. The differences between subgroups were estimated according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Regarding the binary outcomes, patients with incomplete or missing data were included in sensitivity analyses by imputing them:<BR/>

<LI>Likely scenario: worst-case scenario for both colchicine and control.</LI>
<LI>Best-case scenario: best-case scenario for colchicine and worst-case scenario for control.</LI>
<LI>Reported scenario: best-case scenario for both colchicine and control.</LI>
<LI>Worst-case scenario: worst-case scenario for colchicine and best-case scenario for control.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>For secondary outcomes we adopted 'available case analysis', i.e., include data on only those patients, whose results are known, using for denominator the total number of patients who completed the trial for the particular outcome in question. Thus, in the review, the number of patients as the denominator might change according to the secondary outcomes investigated.</P>
<P>
<B>Bias detection<BR/>
</B>Funnel plot was used to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates are associated with study size. The performance of the available methods of detecting publication bias and other biases (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) vary with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>). Therefore, we decided to use the most appropriate method having good trade-off in the sensitivity and specificity, based on characteristics of the trials to be included in this review.</P>

<I>Number of deaths<BR/>
</I>Seven randomised clinical trials involving 398 patients reported data on number of deaths. In the colchicine group 25/200 (12.5%) patients died versus 20/198 (10.1%) patients in the control group. Combining the results of individual trials demonstrated no significant difference in the number of deaths (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<I>Number of deaths and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation<BR/>
</I>Eight randomised clinical trials involving 455 patients reported data on 'number of deaths and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation'. We detected 36/228 (15.8%) deaths and patients who underwent liver transplantation in the colchicine group versus 36/227 (15.9%) in the control group. Combining the results of the eight trials demonstrated no significant difference in this outcome measure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.49) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses. Neither the reported-scenario nor the likely-scenario analyses showed any significant difference between colchicine and placebo/no intervention.

The trials where colchicine was administered with 1 mg/day (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.52) versus 1.2 mg/day (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.44) did not reveal any significant influence on the relative risk of mortality. Test of interaction between the two estimates showed no significant difference (P = 0.44). The trials where colchicine was administered for no longer than two years (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.93) did not differ significantly from the trials where colchicine was administered for longer than two years (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.39).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-24 12:05:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We found no significant difference on mortality or mortality and liver transplantation between colchicine and placebo/no intervention for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. These observations were robust to subgroup analyses taking methodological quality of trials, dose, and treatment duration into consideration. It has been reported that trials with inadequate methodological quality do significantly overestimate the effect of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). However, we found that our results are not sensitive to the adequacy of generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding status, and the use of intention-to-treat analysis, probably due to the relatively small sample size and low number of trials included.</P>
<P>Our systematic review may have a number of limitations. Firstly, our systematic review regarding the comparison of colchicine versus placebo/no intervention on mortality analysed only seven trials involving 398 patients. This is a low number of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>). Additionally, compared to the natural history of primary biliary cirrhosis, most of the trials had relatively short period of medication and follow-up. Thus, the risk of type 2 error (the risk of overlooking an effect if it really exists) is present and a potential beneficial effect of colchicine on survival cannot be reliably excluded. Secondly, the present meta-analyses on mortality and mortality or liver transplantation were based on number of events per randomised patients from the individual trial, not on individual patient data analysis based on time-to-event data. An individual patient data analysis takes time and censored data into consideration and may offer potential advantages. However, the use of meta-analysis based on aggregate data extracted from published and unpublished reports can be considered a useful approach and seems to reach similar conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Liberati-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberati 1996</LINK>). Thirdly, since we could not stratify summary data of included trials according to the patients' baseline stage of primary biliary cirrhosis, we do not know whether the effect of colchicine was associated with the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. Fourthly, we performed a high number of statistical tests, which increases the risk of 'mass significance' (i.e., spurious significant findings due to repetitive testing). Therefore, significant findings ought to be conservatively interpreted. Fifthly, although we employed considerable search strategies and applied no publication status or language limitations, we are concerned about the existence of publication bias and other biases, which leads us to identify 'positive' studies more easily than 'negative' ones (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our findings regarding primary outcome measures did not seem to be sensitive to missing data. Neither the reported scenario nor the likely scenario analyses, which are attempts to fill in missing data in a realistic manner, showed any significant difference between colchicine and placebo/no intervention. The best-case scenario did not show any significant difference. The worst-case scenario detected a significant detrimental effect of colchicine. Although the best-worst-case- and worst-best-case-scenario analyses are extreme and unlikely, it is more probable that the treatment effect did not favour colchicine but placebo/no intervention. Additionally, we found that the effect of colchicine on mortality and liver transplantation (favouring colchicine in the best-worst-case-scenario analyses and favouring placebo/no intervention in the worst-best-case-scenario analysis) to be heavily depended on the <LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1988</LINK> trial, in which the rate of loss of follow-up in the colchicine group was 28.5%. After excluding this trial, we got a non-significant difference (<LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>). In addition, when we included data from 114 patients from two trials switched from blinded to open label colchicine therapy, these differences were not significant either on mortality or on mortality or liver transplantation.</P>
<P>In order to examine the effects of colchicine in a broader context, we expanded our analyses by including trials on colchicine versus placebo/no intervention for alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2003</LINK>). The pooled results showed no significant difference on mortality. In the colchicine group 109/786 (13.9%) patients died versus 106/762 (13.9%) patients in the control group (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Goddard et al. trial was a 2 multiplied by 2 factorial designed trial, which could have investigated the possible interaction between colchicine and UDCA. However, the trial was only published as an abstract and the author did not reply to our request for further information. A synergistic effect was claimed based on a non-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Shibata-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 1992</LINK>). However, our subgroup analyses, stratifying the included trials into monotherapy (i.e., colchicine versus placebo/no intervention) and combination therapy (i.e., colchicine plus UDCA versus placebo/no intervention plus UDCA) did not suggest additional effect of colchicine introduced by the combination with UDCA in the identified trials.</P>
<P>We found that colchicine had a significant beneficial effect on pruritus. This finding was from three trials involving only 156 patients. A number of arguments may contradict this observation. First, lack of efficient blinding of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) and the subjective nature of pruritus assessment could have biased the estimate. Second, pruritus usually reflects indices of cholestasis (e.g., serum alkaline phosphatases) and a correlation between the severity of pruritus and the presence of florid bile duct lesions in the liver has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1999</LINK>). Our analyses did not show any significant effect of colchicine on any plasma indices of cholestasis or on liver histology. Furthermore, due to the large number of statistical comparisons having been performed some of the comparisons might have come out with a significant difference simply due to 'mass significance'. Therefore, we are not convinced that the improvement of pruritus was due to colchicine. The potential beneficial effect of colchicine on pruritus might be worth exploring in future high-quality randomised trials.</P>
<P>We did not find any significant difference on liver biochemical parameters between colchicine treatment and placebo/no intervention. It appeared that the use of colchicine was associated with improvement in hepatic biochemistries in three early randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bodenheimer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bodenheimer 1988</LINK>). In those three trials, however, the protocol violations regarding per cent of randomised patients who were: (i) lost to follow-up; (ii) refused liver biopsy; (iii) were noncompliant, and (iv) were withdrawn due to adverse events or disease progression - were: 33%, 13%, and 38%, respectively. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Warnes-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Warnes 1987</LINK>) stated having employed the intention-to-treat principle.</P>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a pathological process starting with portal inflammation, which progresses towards three irreversible stages: a stage of compensated cirrhosis, a stage of decompensated cirrhosis (defined by high bilirubin levels (greater than 100 µmol/L), ascites, and variceal bleeding), and a terminal stage, in which death occurs unless liver transplantation is performed (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2002</LINK>). The purpose of the randomised clinical trials assessing colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis has not been to evaluate whether colchicine could reverse the decompensated stage or the terminal stage of the disease, but rather, if colchicine could slow the progression towards the cirrhotic stage and the more advanced stages. It is, therefore, interesting to study the effect of colchicine on liver histology. In this review, we were not able to identify any significant effect of colchicine on a number of histological variables. The <LINK REF="STD-Almasio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Almasio 2000</LINK> trial reported a significant reduction in histological grading score in patients administrating colchicine plus ursodeoxycholic acid; however, the proportion of patients having liver biopsy was very low (15 patients out of 90). Thus, its significance could be biased by impact of missing data on liver histology.</P>
<P>Vuoristo et al. performed comparison of colchicine versus ursodeoxycholic acid, the most widely used drug in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. No significant difference was detected regarding mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>). Colchicine appeared to relieve fatigue, but the effect size was small. For the liver biochemical outcomes, the significant difference detected on s-alkaline phosphatases and gamma-glutamyltransferase was suggestive of a favourable effect of ursodeoxycholic acid. This is in accordance with trials comparing ursodeoxycholic acid with placebo/no intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2002</LINK>). Overall, we were not able to suggest beneficial effect of colchicine compared to ursodeoxycholic acid.</P>
<P>Compared to methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist that blocks nucleic acid synthesis, colchicine seemed to be less effective against methotrexate regarding severity of pruritus and level of s-alkaline phosphases and plasma immunoglobulin M. The data we extracted were from a two-year interim analysis of the ten-year <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1999</LINK> trial. The trial is finished, but the published data are not available presently (October 2003).</P>
<P>Regarding the safety issue of colchicine treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis, this systematic review could not demonstrate that colchicine was associated with an increase or decrease of non-serious adverse events (mainly transient diarrhoea, usually resolved by lowering the dose of colchicine) or serious adverse events. We were not able to identify data on the effects of colchicine concerning quality of life and health economics.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We did not find convincing evidence showing that colchicine had significant beneficial effects on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis when compared to placebo or no intervention. The combination of colchicine and UDCA did not significantly change the effects of colchicine. We are not able to exclude the possibility that colchicine may reduce mortality by 70%. On the other hand, it may increase mortality by 344%. We therefore cannot recommend the use of colchicine outside randomised clinical trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>If researchers have an interest to investigate colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis, they may consider the following: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>due to the chronic progression of primary biliary cirrhosis and thanks to the low toxicity of colchicine, long-term follow-up is needed and seems feasible; </LI>
<LI>to have an independent data monitoring and safety committee, which can follow the data and stop the trial should it start to demonstrate harmful effects of colchicine</LI>
<LI>to study in detail the potential effect of colchicine on pruritus; </LI>
<LI>to ensure that enough patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are kept followed to undergo liver biopsy in order to obtain more data on liver histology; </LI>
<LI>to include quality-of-life and health economics analyses; </LI>
<LI>to adhere to the Consort Statement (www.consort-statement.org).</LI>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Date of Submission: 13-Jun-2006<BR/>Name: Roger Pepin<BR/>Email Address: r.pepin@elsevier.com<BR/>Personal Description: Occupation EBM Editor</P>
<P>Feedback: Could someone clarify the relationship of this review and the review published in American Journal of Gastroenterology, 2005 Aug;100(8):1876-85. In particular, could they comment on the differing numbers of trials included in each review, and the observations made of trial quality in each abstract.</P>
<P>Submitter agrees with default conflict of interest statement:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>We published the systematic review in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 2, based on which we published a modified version in The American Journal of Gastroenterology in 2005. The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group has endorsed a co-publication agreement with The American Journal of Gastroenterology. </P>
<P>The trials included in the review published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology compare colchicine versus placebo/no intervention. The review published in The Cochrane Library is broader since it also includes trials comparing colchicine versus ursodeoxycholic acid and colchicine versus methotrexate.</P>
<P>We stated in the The American Journal of Gastroenterology the following:<BR/>'This review is published as a Cochrane Review in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 2. Cochrane Reviews are regularly updated as new evidence emerges and in response to comments and criticisms. The Cochrane Library should be consulted for the most recent version of the Review.'</P>
