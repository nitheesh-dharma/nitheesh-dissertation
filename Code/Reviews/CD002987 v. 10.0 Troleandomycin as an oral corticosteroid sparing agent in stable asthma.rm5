<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Troleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic with established effects in the treatment of infections. It alters the breakdown of corticosteroid drugs, so may be of benefit in asthma. This review found three small studies, that provide no evidence to justify the use of this drug in asthma.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-09-13 15:04:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Patients with chronic severe asthma are often dependent on the long term prescription of oral corticosteroids. The use of steroids is associated with serious side effects. Physicians treating such patients continue to search for alternative therapies that reduce the need for chronic dosing with oral steroids. Troleandomycin is a compound that is established as an effective antibiotic but may also have non-antibacterial actions that may be useful in the treatment of asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of adding troleandomycin to oral steroids in the treatment of chronic steroid dependent asthmatics.</P>

<P>Three trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review and a total of 112 patients were recruited into these studies. Data from 90 patients were analysed. There was no treatment effect for troleandomycin in terms of steroid dose reduction (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.75, 0.17). For measures of lung function a meta-analysis of data derived from two of the included studies showed no benefits for added troleandomycin (SMD 0.06 95% CI -0.8, 0.9). </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-01 16:04:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The recognition that asthma is a consequence of airway inflammation has focused treatment objectives towards anti-inflammatory agents. Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids are of proven benefit.</P>
<P>There are, however, a group of asthmatics who continue to have symptoms despite high doses of inhaled steroids and require maintenance treatment with oral corticosteroids. Whilst these patients are in the minority, in the order of 1-2%, this subset constitute a significant number and consume a considerable and disproportionate fraction of the health care resources. Furthermore these patients are at risks from the unwanted effects of long term treatment with systemic corticosteroids. These include osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, neuro psychiatric disorders and growth retardation in children.</P>
<P>As a result of this clinical dilemma there have been a number of clinical trials examining the use of 'second-line' immunosuppressive agents. These include agents such as methotrexate, gold, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, and troleandomycin. The concept that these drugs may be of benefit in asthma has arisen from studies showing benefits in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. To date only methotrexate in asthma has been reviewed.<BR/>Troleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic with established effects in the treatment of infections. Its most likely mechanism of action relates to the inhibition of the clearance of methylprednisolone. However there is some in vitro work showing reductions in neutrophil chemotaxis, inhibitory effects on mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, reductions in basophil histamine release, and airway mucous secretion. Overall however the evidence would support steroid related actions rather than direct immunomodulatory effects.</P>
<P>This conclusion arises from the finding that patients taking troleandomycin frequently manifest Cushingoid features in excess of that expected for the doses of steroid given, adding further weight to the arguments forwarded concerning its mode of action. In addition troleandomycin inhibits the metabolism of theophylline and this may in part explain the gastrointestinal upset it causes.</P>
<P>The use of troleandomycin as an adjunct to oral corticosteroids has been reported in both open &amp; blinded randomised controlled studies in asthma. These studies have employed differing methodology and to date the results have been conflicting. Previous narrative reviews give the overall impression that it is of benefit, but this has not been established. A systematic review with meta-analysis may help to synthesize the data.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the literature concerning the benefit of adding troleandomycin to oral corticosteroids in chronic stable asthmatics who were dependent on oral corticosteroids</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-09-13 15:04:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Three studies were identified, all of which were published as full articles. All studies were published since 1990 in English language journals. They were all parallel group studies and were all carried out in steroid dependent subjects. They were all relatively small and mainly of short duration. All these patients had demonstrable reversibility of FEV1. All trials excluded patients with significant co-morbidity. None of the trials included smokers. All patients in these studies were maximally treated with inhaled bronchodilators and oral theophylline. Patients were maintained on inhaled steroids with the exception of the study reported by Nelson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>) where they were excluded. The initial dose of troleandomycin was 250 mg daily in all studies. Update searches conducted in September 2008 and 2010 did not identify any additional trials.</P>
<P>A detailed description of each study follows:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> studied 15 children, between 8 and 18 years, over a 2 week period. Study subjects were randomised to receive troleandomycin 250 mg daily (TAO) and methylprednisolone (MP), placebo with MP, or TAO with prednisolone in parallel groups. For patients switched to MP, the dose was calculated as 80% of the pre-randomisation prednisolone dose. The group consisted of 9 boys and 6 girls. The mean age was 13.5 years. All patients had been steroid dependent for a minimum of 3 years and had been subjected to steroid tapering prior to randomisation. Patients were assessed daily during the treatment period.<BR/>
<BR/>The authors found that all patients were able to tolerate at least a 50% reduction in the dose of their steroids. This change was not associated with any change in lung function or worsening in markers of asthma control. Limited long term follow up confirmed the TAO-MP group showed the most consistent stability in asthma control. Measures of airway responsiveness (AR) showed improvements in 4/5 patients in the TAO/MP group, 2/5 in the TAO/prednisolone group and none of the MP/placebo group. Differences between groups did not reach significance. No drug related adverse events or abnormalities of liver function were reported for TAO. One patient (MP/placebo) was noted to have raised intra-occular pressure at the beginning of treatment - this settled during the treatment phase with steroid reductions, and another developed acute psychosis (TAO/prednisolone). Both of these may have been related to steroid treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies showed reduction in MP clearance times in the patients on TAO/MP.</P>
<P>In conclusion the authors suggested that low dose TAO had beneficial steroid sparing effects in children that were not totally attributable to inhibition of MP clearance given the improvements seen amongst the TAO/prednisolone patients. They reported a protective effect of TAO against airway challenge with methacholine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>: 18 children (11 boys), 6-17 years, completed the protocol. Patients were screened and threshold (i.e. lowest) doses of steroids were identified. Individuals were randomised to receive TAO/MP, TAO/prednisolone or MP/placebo. The dose of TAO was 250 mg daily. The treatment period was 12 weeks. Patients were monitored on the ward for the first 2 weeks of the study, thereafter weekly contact was maintained.</P>
<P>The maximum tolerated dose reductions were significant for each treatment group (80% TAO/MP, 55% TAO/prednisolone, 44% MP/placebo). There were significant differences between the TAO/MP group and the MP/placebo group. Similarly there were reductions in the requirements for added prednisolone treatment of exacerbations, the greatest effect seen in the TAO/MP patients although these changes did not reach significance.</P>
<P>There were no significant changes in lung function in the TAO/MP patients amongst whom there were less reported symptoms (p = 0.025). Worsened lung function was reported for the TAO/prednisolone treated patients. For AR there were reductions in the PC20 Methacholine in the TAO/MP (p = 0.011) and MP/placebo groups, whereas slight protection afforded by TAO/prednisolone. 2 patients experienced abnormalities of liver function on TAO.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that TAO is safe and is a reasonable option in the treatment of steroid-dependent asthma. They do not hypothesise about the relative contributions to these benefits with respect to direct effects and those mediated via steroid metabolism.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>: 57 patients (19 men), aged 21 - 75 years, completed the trial. Steroid tapering was undertaken prior to study entry and patients were randomised to receive TAO/MP or MP/placebo. The dose of TAO was 250 mg and the trial ran for one year (double-blind phase) with a single blind period during a second year for some of the study subjects.<BR/>29/30 patients receiving TAO/MP and 23/27 on MP/placebo managed to reduce steroids to an alternating day regime. The mean daily steroid dose for TAO/MP was 6.3 mg/day and for MP/placebo, 10.4 mg/day (p = 0.03). Control of asthma was maintained and similar in both groups. No differences were seen for steroid side effects between the two groups.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that the benefits seen in the TAO group were accountable to its effects on MP metabolism alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">(iii) Prior attempts at reduction in oral corticosteroid dose should have been unsuccessful in eliminating chronic use. </HEADING>
<P>A "run in" period on a steady dose of oral corticosteroid following an attempt at reduction of corticosteroid dose was identified as an important component of the trial design.</P>
<P>Attempts to taper steroid doses before the treatment periods were stated explicitly only in <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al refer to tapering 'in a way consistent with good asthma control'. In fact this report states that at randomisation some of the patients were receiving higher doses of steroid than previously so as to ensure good control at the start of the study. No tapering was done in the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al. Criteria for steroid dependency was similar in the trials reported by <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al, approximately 30 mg a day, although this parallel is difficult to draw given that the patients in the latter study were children. The patients reported in each of the treatment groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> study had baseline doses of 21 mg, 24 mg, 34 mg a day.

<P>The literature searches identified twelve trials of which 3 fulfilled criteria for selection into the review. Attempts to contact the authors for information were made and we are grateful to Drs Kamada and Bruchmeier (Nelson et al) for supplying further data.</P>
<P>Initially a total of 112 patients were enrolled and data was collected from 90 patients across the three trials reviewed. Of these 58 individuals completed the various protocols. The majority of the patients were included in the study by Nelson et al (75 patients enrolled).The trials were of varying duration; 2 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK>), 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>), and up to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The various study groups were all diagnosed as asthmatic with no other pulmonary co-morbidity but no details of pre-trial lung function were given in any of the studies, with the exception of the patients reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al whose subjects had a mean FEV1 of 83% at baseline.</P>
<P>The primary outcome variable in all trials was a reduction in the dose of steroids although this was not explicitly stated in any of the trials. Steroid data were expressed as both absolute doses for each patient as well as percentage reduction by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al. <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> showed the baseline and 12 week data for treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al expressed results in terms of methylprednisolone dosage as well as reporting outcomes such as exacerbation rates, hospital visits and admissions for asthma. Individual patient data was used in this instance following receipt of the raw data from the authors. Overall there was no demonstrable benefit for the addition of TAO to methylprednisolone in terms of steroid dose reduction (SMD -0.29 95% CI -0.75, 0.17). No analysis was done comparing the effects of TAO and prednisolone since the studies were not specifically designed to address this and there were insufficient data for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of measures of spirometry derived from the data presented by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al shows no significant treatment effects of added TAO (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.8, 0.9). No change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was seen at the end of the first treatment year in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al and no data for the second year are shown. In this trial no differences between the groups for asthma control, exacerbations or hospital requirements were found although no specific data were presented. No differences were seen for exacerbations in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al. In the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al symptom scores were not significantly reduced in the patients randomised to TAO-methylprednisolone.</P>
<P>For measures of bronchial reactivity the results in the three trials were mixed. Few of the study subjects in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al were able to undergo this test (11 on placebo, 13 on TAO). There were insignificant reductions in airways responsiveness in both groups and a trend towards greater improvements in the TAO patients (p = 0.08). <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al showed non significant improvements in airway responsiveness in the methylprednisolone-TAO patients and no changes in the prednisolone-TAO or methylprednisolone groups. In fact <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al showed significant increases in airway responsiveness in the methylprednisolone -TAO group with non-significant changes in the other two treatment groups.</P>
<P>There were no withdrawals from treatment in the studies reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and one from the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al. 18 patients ( 7 TAO, 11 placebo) withdrew from the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> during the first year and a further 32 withdrew during the second year of double blind treatment. Reasons for exiting the study are not given although the authors found no significant differences between the withdrawing patients and the trial survivors for markers of asthma control in either placebo or TAO treatment. They conclude that the withdrawals were not due to treatment failures. No details concerning liver function were given in this paper. Two patients had clinically important abnormalities of liver enzymes in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al and one of these was withdrawn from the study, the other resolved spontaneously. Liver function remained normal in all the subjects studied by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al.</P>
<P>No theophylline toxicity was reported in any of the studies but levels required careful monitoring throughout. A 30% reduction in dose of theophylline was required in five patients studied by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al.</P>
<P>The question as to whether the benefits measured in terms of steroid dose requirements was solely attributable to effects on methylprednisolone metabolism rather than any other effects of TAO was addressed by <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al. <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al measured methylprednisolone clearance rates and showed a 62% reduction on TAO but did not present any data on steroid side effects amongst the TAO responders. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al showed untoward and significant changes in bone density, lipids and fasting blood glucose in patients randomised to TAO-methylprednisolone despite lower doses of methylprednisolone indicating effects via steroid metabolism alone. Over the 12 weeks of treatment in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al no objective features consistent with increased steroid effects (blood pressure, weight, bone densitometry etc) were measured in any of the treatment groups although two individuals in the TAO-methylprednisolone group developed marked Cushingoid features (vertebral collapse and striae respectively).</P>
<P>No significant heterogeneity was identified amongst the data analysed by meta-analysis.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The result from the meta-analysis of these three studies for steroid doses shows a trend in favour of TAO but no significant effects for TAO in terms of steroid sparing qualities (SMD -0.29 95% CI -0.75, 0.17). At first sight this may seem a surprising result since TAO might be expected to reduce steroid doses through it's effects on methylprednisolone clearance, notwithstanding any other beneficial asthma effects. However, this pre-supposes a steep dose=response effect for oral corticosteroids in asthma, which has not been shown. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al found a significant effect for steroid dose in favour of the TAO group at one year but the baseline doses for placebo and TAO were significantly different making comparisons of dose differences at time points thereafter difficult. Analysis of changes in dose between baseline and one year for individual patients (kindly supplied by the authors and used in the meta-analysis) shows no significant treatment effects between groups.</P>
<P>There are some important differences between these studies that are worthy of mention in the interpretation of this review. The most important of these relates to the study subjects. Two of the trials examined the effects of TAO in groups of steroid dependent children. Very little data that could be used to define the severity of the subjects is given in any of the trials. There are inconsistencies in the use of inhaled steroids across these three trials. This is an important deficit in the usefulness of the review given the importance of inhaled corticosteroids as 'steroid sparing agents'. The use of theophylline is an important and potential confounding variable. TAO interferes with theophylline clearance and therefore benefits in asthma control may arise from increases in the effective serum levels of this drug. In fact all three studies titrated doses of theophylline and as far as can be surmised this factor was appropriately controlled. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al were small and of short duration. Efforts to show conclusive effects for TAO may be hindered by short treatment trial duration. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al report a larger group of adults over one year with a smaller number of patients going on to complete a second study year. The results from both the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al need to be interpreted with caution as there was no formal tapering of steroids during run-in to the treatment periods. It is difficult to draw conclusions from a review of such diverse research methodology.</P>
<P>Efficacy of drugs used to treat asthma should be measured in terms of lung function (PEFR, FEV1, FVC etc) and markers of asthma control (symptom scores, exacerbation rates, quality of life scores etc). <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al made no attempt to demonstrate efficacy. Their study was designed to look at steroid doses and markers of steroid side effects with a view to demonstrating mechanisms of action for TAO. As predicted by the authors, there were no significant differences between the groups for these parameters. Neither of the other two studies showed significant changes in lung function or markers of asthma control. There were trends towards improvements in airway responsiveness in these latter studies although no mechanisms other than steroid related benefits have been proposed.</P>
<P>None of the reports calculated the power of the study. Type 2 statistical errors cannot be excluded in these instances and this may be of particular importance to the measures of airways responsiveness made by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>All three studies looked at the issue of steroid related side effects in an attempt to demonstrate a mechanism for TAO. Efforts to find non-steroid related asthma benefits were done by making measures of airways reactivity to methacholine although no other end points such as bronchial biopsy were done to elucidate mechanisms. Clearly techniques such as this would have been difficult in children notwithstanding the severity of the patients across all three studies. The studies reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al and <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al were small and too brief to add meaningful data to the understanding of how TAO might work. Nevertheless <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al confirmed significant reductions in the clearance of methylprednisolone (not seen for prednisolone) in keeping with the argument that the drug works in this way. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1993</LINK> et al were able to show significant and untoward effects on steroid levels as manifest by changes in fasting blood glucose, lipids and bone densitometry. They conclude that TAO mediated it's modest effects through the reduction in methylprednisolone clearance. These effects are not seen for prednisolone and the consensus view from other publications would support this. </P>
<P>With reference to safety issues unrelated to steroid side effects, there was also shortage of data for entry into meta-analysis. Interestingly the important side effect of TAO, namely abnormalities of liver function did not emerge as a major problem from the two studies reporting this data. Two patients in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kamada-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kamada 1993</LINK> et al showed abnormalities, but no problems were presented in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ball-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ball 1990</LINK> et al.</P>
<P>In summary the three trials included in this review amount to a relatively small body of evidence. There are flaws in each study and differences between the trials that further weaken the meaning of the combined results. Overall, the data show no significant effect on oral steroid dose. From the perspective of safety, whilst there are established serious side effects of this treatment, this review has not demonstrated significant untoward changes in parameters such as liver function. Nevertheless there are changes that suggest augmentation of steroid effects inclusive of side effects. This is endorsed by pharmacokinetic data presented in one of the studies. Under these circumstances the potential benefits in terms of measured reduced steroid doses are clinically insignificant and the available evidence does not support the use of TAO as a steroid sparing agent in asthma. <BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence available does not support the use of TAO as a steroid sparing agent in the treatment of asthma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials with sufficient power to conclusively evaluate TAO whether the beneficial effects that are not attributable to potentiation of steroid actions exist. These trials should be undertaken amongst adult patients who are optimally managed on inhaled steroids following careful tapering during run-in.</P>
