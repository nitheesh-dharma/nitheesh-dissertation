<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:55:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherosclerosis can cause narrowing and hardening of the main blood vessel supplying the kidneys (renal artery stenosis) resulting in high blood pressure. Even using drugs that lower blood pressure (antihypertensives) atherosclerotic renal artery narrowing tends to progress. Poor blood flow results in a lack of oxygen (renal ischaemia) and loss of kidney function, causing kidney failure. Currently, possible treatments are medical treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs, balloon angioplasty with stent insertion (insertion of a balloon-like tube which is inflated to open up the artery followed by insertion of a metal tube which remains in place to try and keep the artery open), and surgery to reconstruct the artery. The review authors identified eight controlled trials in which a total of 2222 adults were randomised to have balloon angioplasty or drug treatment only. The overall quality of the evidence was considered to be moderate because the methodological quality of the studies varied substantially and two of the studies had not provided sufficient data to be able to assess their risk of bias. Overall, the data were insufficient to show that one treatment was better than the other for preventing loss of kidney function or restenosis of the renal artery. Those treated with balloon angioplasty may require fewer antihypertensive drugs or lower doses and experience a slight improvement in diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Balloon angioplasty appears to be safe and there were similar numbers of renal and cardiovascular adverse events in participants treated with either approach. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (collection of blood outside the blood vessel at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), dilated groin artery (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or tear (2.5%) as well as deaths shortly before, during or after the procedure (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-18 08:08:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis but the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, to include the results of recent, important large trials, of a review first published in 2003.<BR/>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-19 13:42:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-18 08:14:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-19 13:26:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were extracted independently on trial design, participants, interventions and outcome measures. A formal meta-analysis was completed to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function and cardiovascular and renal adverse events. Peto's odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous variables were calculated.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:55:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta-analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD -2.00 mmHg; 95% CI -3.72 to -0.27) whilst the meta-analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD -1.07 mmHg; 95% CI -3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD -7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI -22.6 to 6.62). Meta-analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-18 08:28:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data are insufficient to conclude that revascularisation in the form of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, is superior to medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. However, balloon angioplasty results in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure and a small reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements. Balloon angioplasty appears safe and results in similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events to medical therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-18 09:56:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-18 08:52:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (progressive narrowing and hardening of the main blood vessel supplying the kidneys) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension (high blood pressure) and accounts for 1% to 5% of all cases of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Derkx-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derkx 1994</LINK>). Prospective studies on renal angiography in patients starting dialysis identified atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis as the underlying cause of end stage renal failure in up to 20% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Novick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novick 1996</LINK>). With increasing population age and widespread use of noninvasive screening tests, the frequency of documented renal artery stenosis will probably increase (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite antihypertensive drug therapy, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis tends to progress, leading to renal ischaemia (poor blood flow resulting in a lack of oxygen) and loss of renal (kidney) function (<LINK REF="REF-Zierler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zierler 1997</LINK>). The rate of progression has been reported to be 4% to 12% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1991</LINK>). The probability of survival in patients with renal artery stenosis depends on the severity of the impairment of renal function. In a cohort study of patients treated with stent revascularisation (insertion of a tube (stent) to keep the artery open and allow blood to flow through) three-year survival was 92% for patients with normal renal function, 74% for patients with mild renal failure and 52% for patients with more severe renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Dorros-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorros 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-18 09:07:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there are three possible therapeutic options for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS). These are medical treatment with antihypertensive drugs, balloon angioplasty with or without stent insertion, and surgery to reconstruct the artery. In a trial comparing balloon angioplasty with surgical reconstruction for the treatment of renal artery stenosis, the interventions were equally effective in restoring patency of the obstructed vessel but balloon angioplasty was associated with fewer major complications (<LINK REF="REF-Weibull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weibull 1993</LINK>). Surgical reconstruction does not therefore seem to offer any clinical benefit over balloon angioplasty in patients with ARAS. For that reason, this review focuses on the relative benefits of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, in comparison to medical treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-12 13:14:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is generally regarded that restoring renal artery patency may reduce blood pressure and prevent decline in renal function by improving renal blood flow. This prevents any further ischaemic damage to the renal parenchyma from subsequent progression of stenosis or catastrophic thrombosis. It also reduces stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system with a resultant reduction in vasoconstriction and a fall in salt and water retention. Blood pressure therefore falls and the renal parenchyma is protected from hypertension-induced damage.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-18 09:56:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Promising results from early observational studies suggested that balloon angioplasty was superior to medical therapy for the treatment of ARAS, with balloon angioplasty resulting in a cure from hypertension in 19% of patients and to improved blood pressure control (as measured by a reduction in the dosage of antihypertensive drugs by at least half a tablet a day) in 52% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 1990</LINK>). Based on these results balloon angioplasty continues to be widely used for the treatment of renal artery stenosis. However, these early findings have not been replicated in more recent randomised controlled trials and the optimal role for angioplasty is currently unclear. This systematic review of randomised controlled trials aimed to compare the effect of balloon angioplasty and medical treatment in hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis on blood pressure control, renal function and treatment complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2008.</P>

We set out to pool data on changes in systolic and diastolic BP, serum creatinine, and the numbers of antihypertensive drugs from each trial to arrive at an estimate of the overall effectiveness of balloon angioplasty. For continuous outcomes such as BP and creatinine we presented the statistical analysis results as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and for dichotomous outcomes as Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Not all studies presented standard deviations (SD) for the change in BP or the number of antihypertensive drugs and, where necessary, these were imputed from the available data using methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included studies had provided the SDs for serum creatinine measurements during follow-up and serum creatinines were therefore chosen to measure treatment effect rather than changes in serum creatinine from baseline, for which no SDs were provided. However, there are limitations in presenting serum creatinine at the end of follow-up, the main one being that this does not take into account any differences in serum creatinine between angioplasty and medical treatment groups at baseline.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-11-18 10:53:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The unit of randomisation was the individual participant in all included studies. All of the included trials collected follow-up data at different points in time, ranging from one month to five years. In order to enable pooling of the BP and creatinine results, data from either the end of follow-up or two years into follow-up were pooled. Two years into follow-up was chosen as one study followed up participants for five years but by the end of the five-year follow-up many participants had either died or been lost to follow-up. It was therefore felt to be more appropriate to analyse the two-year follow-up data for this study.</P>

Seven trials were fully randomised (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) whilst one trial (<LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK>) reported results of randomised and non-randomised participants separately. We only considered the results of the randomised participants for this review.</P>
<P>No randomised controlled trial with a shorter follow-up than six months was found.</P>
<P>Since only eight trials were identified, no kappa test to assess inter-rater agreement was performed.</P>
<P>In all eight included trials hypertensive men and women with renal artery stenosis were randomly allocated to balloon angioplasty or medical therapy with antihypertensive drugs. The number of included participants in the studies ranged from 49 to 947. Follow-up was six months in the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trials, 12 months in the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trial, 24 months in the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial, 32 months in the <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> trial, 43 months in the <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trials and five years in the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial. The <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trials had two to six-week run-in periods on standardised antihypertensive treatment. In the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trials antihypertensive drug therapy was stopped at the time of the intervention in participants assigned to balloon angioplasty, and subsequently reinstated if necessary. In the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trials antihypertensive drug therapy was continued after balloon angioplasty. Information on the presence or absence of any run-in period or the discontinuation of antihypertensive drug therapy was not available for the <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> trials.</P>
<P>Not all participants allocated to balloon angioplasty underwent the procedure, predominantly due to minimal stenosis being present at the time of angiography. In the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial 335 of the 403 (83%) participants allocated to balloon angioplasty underwent attempted revascularisation compared with 46 out of 64 (72%) in the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial and 442 out of 467 (95%) in the <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trial. All of these three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis. All participants allocated to balloon angioplasty in the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> trials underwent attempted revascularisation, although in five participants in the intervention group in the <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trial this was in the form of either a vein bypass or a nephrectomy. Data for the <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> trial were not available.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trial no patient in the balloon angioplasty group underwent stent insertion. In the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trial 2 of 56 (4%) participants assigned to balloon angioplasty received a stent compared with 2 of 23 (9%) participants in the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> trial; 46 of 64 (72%) in the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial; 317 of 403 (79%) in the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial and 442 out of 467 (95%) in the <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trial. All of the participants assigned to angioplasty underwent stent insertion in the <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> trial. Data for the <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> trial were not available.</P>
<P>There was a large variation between trials in the proportion of participants crossing over from medical treatment to balloon angioplasty. In the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> trial seven of 26 (27%) participants assigned to medical therapy stopped drug treatment early due to refractory hypertension (defined as diastolic BP greater than 104 mmHg despite a maximal tolerated antihypertensive regimen) and subsequently underwent angioplasty. The clinical characteristics of these seven participants immediately before angioplasty were used for data analysis. In the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trial 22 of 50 (44%) participants underwent angioplasty due to diastolic BP measures greater than 95 mmHg despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs; or progressive renovascular occlusive disease, defined as an increase of at least 18 µmol/L in serum creatinine or worsening of the time-activity renogram on scintigraphy, after three months of medical therapy. The data from these participants were analysed in the medical therapy group at 12 months follow-up although they had undergone balloon angioplasty after three months follow-up. In the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial one out of 76 participants (1%) underwent angioplasty with stenting due to refractory hypertension (defined as BP greater than &gt; 180/100 mmHg despite a maximal tolerated antihypertensive regime). The data for this one participant were included in the medical therapy group follow-up data. In the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial 24 out of 403 (6%) underwent balloon angioplasty. The specific reasons for participants crossing over were not given and these participants were included in the medical treatment group follow-up data. In the <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trial 19 out of 480 (4%) crossed over. They were included in the intention-to-treat analysis in the medical treatment group. No participants in the <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trial that were assigned to medical treatment subsequently underwent balloon angioplasty. Data for the <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> trials were not available.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> trial ambulatory BP was the primary outcome of the study, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trials used office BP as the primary outcome measure (office BP is the average of three sitting BP measurements taken in the presence of a physician after five minutes rest). The more recent <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trials both defined renal endpoints as their primary outcomes with the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial assessing the change in renal function (measured by the mean slope of the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level over time) and the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial assessing worsening renal function (defined as a 20% or greater decrease in estimated creatinine clearance compared with baseline). Changes in BP were measured in both studies as a secondary outcome. The primary outcome of the <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> trial was unclear as full details of this study have not yet been published. The <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trial had a primary outcome that was a composite of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. The <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK> trial primary endpoint was the change in estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate over 12 months.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trial presented the results for participants with bilateral renal artery stenosis separately from those with unilateral stenosis. These results were pooled to enable comparison with the five other studies which did not present separate analyses for participants with uni- and bilateral stenoses.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs after one year of follow-up. SDs were not reported and these were imputed by calculating the mean of the SDs from the <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trials. The pooled results from the three trials included in the meta-analysis found that there was a statistically significant MD of -0.18 (95% CI -0.34 to -0.03; P = 0.02, I² = 0%) for the number of antihypertensive drugs in the angioplasty group compared to the medical treatment group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

The median DDD at baseline was 1.33 in both groups and decreased to 1.0 (range 0 to 6) in the balloon angioplasty group. In the medical therapy group the median DDD increased to 1.78 (range 0 to 4.3; P = 0.009) for the difference between the two groups. The <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trials only indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the number of antihypertensive drugs used at the end of follow-up without providing more specific information.

<P>Restenosis rates could not be assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trial because they did not indicate separate restenosis rates for randomised and non-randomised participants. In the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> trial none of the stenotic arteries in either of the two groups were totally occluded on the termination angiogram, but no data on restenosis rates were indicated. In the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trial angiography was performed in 48 of 56 participants in the angioplasty group, and in 43 of 50 participants in the medical therapy group. Significantly more participants (52%) assigned to balloon angioplasty compared to medical therapy (19%) had a stenosis of less than 50% after 12 months (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.8 to 9.8). In the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial angiography was repeated in five participants in the intervention group only. This was due to a decline in renal function, and two of the five were found to have restenosis and this was revascularised.

The complication rate in the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> trial (table 2 of their paper) was erroneously reported as number rather than percentage of participants according to the principal author. The <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK> trials reported adverse events during a follow-up of six months, the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial during a follow-up of 24 months, the <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trials during a follow-up of 43 months and the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial during a follow-up of five years (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

<P>There were similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events in participants treated with balloon angioplasty relative to medical therapy.

<P>Of the participants who underwent balloon angioplasty, 64 out of 987 (6.5%) developed a significant haematoma at the site of catheter insertion, using individual trial definitions for this complication, seven out of 987 (0.7%) femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, 25 out of 987 (2.5%) renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection. There were four (0.4%) peri-procedural deaths (defined as death from procedure-related causes within 30 days of the procedure): two from the <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trial following a perforated renal artery, and two from the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial due to cardiac causes.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:56:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed eight randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment to balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, in hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:55:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our meta-analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference in serum creatinine or in cardiovascular or renal adverse events between the balloon angioplasty and medical treatment arms. There was a small improvement in diastolic BP and a small reduction in the number of antihypertensive drugs required in the angioplasty group relative to the medical treatment group. However, the quality and methodology of the studies is variable and not all the available data from all eight studies could be combined as part of a pooled analysis.</P>
<P>There is a non-significant trend towards a reduction in cardiovascular and renal adverse events in the angioplasty group relative to the medical treatment group. A type beta error with false acceptance of the null hypothesis is therefore a possibility and larger trials with increased power are required to address this issue.</P>
<P>A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.</P>
<P>Overall, the available evidence suggests that the benefits of balloon angioplasty for patients with renal artery stenosis are at best limited to a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure (BP) and a small reduction in antihypertensive medication.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-19 03:44:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the included studies is variable and overall there is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not patients with renal artery stenosis benefit clinically from balloon angioplasty. None of the studies presented data separately according to the severity of the renal artery stenosis, and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK>) analysed results separately for participants with unilateral and bilateral stenosis. We were therefore unable to carry out any subgroup analyses to try and identify groups of patients who may potentially have a greater clinical benefit from angioplasty.</P>
<P>An additional limitation to the analysis was the fact that only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK>) reported SDs for changes in systolic BP and only one study (<LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK>) for the change in diastolic BP during follow-up. SDs were therefore imputed for the five other studies included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SNRASCG" TYPE="STUDY">SNRASCG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) using the available data from the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> trial. Additionally, one study (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>) did not report SDs for the mean number of antihypertensive drugs and these were imputed using the SD data available for the other two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK>). The imputation of SDs, particularly in the changes in systolic and diastolic BP meta-analyses where three out of five and four out of five studies, respectively, were missing SDs, may reduce the validity of the meta-analysis results.</P>
<P>It should also be noted that angiographic techniques are constantly improving, with the five more recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) all comparing angioplasty with stent insertion to medical treatment rather than angioplasty alone.The most recently published trial (<LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>) also included the use of distal protection devices. As yet, these technological advances do not appear to have translated into improved patient outcomes. A subgroup analysis restricting all the meta-analyses to the five studies that carried out angioplasty with stenting (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NITER" TYPE="STUDY">NITER</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RADAR" TYPE="STUDY">RADAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) did not significantly alter any of the results apart from the change in diastolic BP, where the mean difference (MD) between the angioplasty and the medical treatment group reduced and became non-significant (MD -1.24 mmHg; 95% CI -3.23 to 0.75; P = 0.22, I² = 0%).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:56:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A significant limitation of this review is that several of the studies did not provide enough information to accurately judge the risk of bias, and the majority of studies were considered to be at high risk of bias in at least two areas. Selection bias could not be determined in half of studies as authors failed to report the methods used for random number generation and concealing allocation. Due to the nature of the trials, allocation concealment was not possible. Detection bias could not be assessed for the majority of the trials as insufficient information was provided with regards to the blinding of personnel. The majority of studies were low risk for attrition and reporting bias as they had reported on all pre-specified study outcomes and accounted for all participants.</P>
<P>Four of the studies were considered to be high risk for other sources of bias, which was largely due to either significant numbers of participants crossing over from medical treatment to balloon angioplasty or not all participants allocated to angioplasty undergoing revascularisation. This may have reduced any benefits of angioplasty relative to medical treatment. One trial enrolled participants only if their clinician was uncertain as to whether revascularisation would be of clinical benefit (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>). Therefore, patients who otherwise met the study inclusion criteria but were felt to be likely to benefit from angioplasty were excluded from the study, and this may have resulted in the potential benefits of angioplasty being underestimated.</P>
<P>A further source of heterogeneity is the different BP regimes employed in the different studies. In some of the studies specific antihypertensive treatment protocols were provided (<LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK>) whilst in other studies (<LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>) local centres used their own treatment protocols.</P>
<P>The ASTRAL trial had 806 participants and the CORAL trial had 947 participants, and these trials therefore accounted for the majority of the participants included in the meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis was carried out and this showed that these studies did not heavily influence any of the meta-analysis results, with the exception of the meta-analysis of the number of antihypertensive drugs. If either the CORAL or ASTRAL trial was excluded from this meta-analysis then the MD between antihypertensive drug requirements in the angioplasty group relative to the medial treatment group reduced and became non-significant (MD-0.15; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.12; P = 0.27, I² = 10% and MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.00; P = 0.05, I² = 14%, respectively).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was considered to be moderate because the methodological quality of the studies varied substantially and two of the studies had not provided sufficient data to be able to assess their risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-19 04:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review we identified all the randomised controlled trials that compared angioplasty to medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. We believe our search for randomised controlled trials has been inclusive and that our standardised methods of study selection and data extraction should not have introduced bias. We were not always able to pool the available data due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes.</P>
<P>Serum creatinine at two years or end of follow-up was selected as an outcome as SD data were not available for change in creatinine during follow-up. The main limitation of presenting final serum creatinine levels as an outcome is that the final value does not take into account the change from baseline.</P>
<P>Only the <LINK REF="STD-EMMA" TYPE="STUDY">EMMA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trials reported SDs for change in BP during follow-up. SDs were therefore imputed for the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STAR" TYPE="STUDY">STAR</LINK> trials from the available data using methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Similarly, only the <LINK REF="STD-DRASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">DRASTIC</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-CORAL" TYPE="STUDY">CORAL</LINK> trials reported SDs for the mean number of antihypertensive drugs and SDs were therefore imputed for the <LINK REF="STD-ASTRAL" TYPE="STUDY">ASTRAL</LINK> trial.</P>

<P>To date, one other meta-analysis has examined the effect of angioplasty on atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kumbhani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumbhani 2011</LINK>).

<P>The available data does not allow us to conclude that balloon angioplasty is superior to medical therapy in lowering the blood pressure of patients with renal artery stenosis in whom blood pressure can be controlled with medical therapy. However, angioplasty does appear to be safe and there is no evidence of increased complications relative to medical therapy.</P>
<P>Overall, the data does not provide any evidence that angioplasty reduces the incidence of cardiovascular or renal adverse events when compared to the best available medical therapy. Angioplasty does seem to have a small drug-saving effect and may result in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure, but the clinical importance of these benefits is unclear as there is no evidence that these improvements translate into improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-19 04:00:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-conducted randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of medical therapy and balloon angioplasty in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should be performed to overcome methodological errors evident in the published literature. These trials should ensure a sufficient number of participants are included to provide statistical power, unambiguous participant selection criteria, blinded outcome assessment, and follow-up of three or more years in order to evaluate the long-term effect of the interventions on the preservation of renal function. Studies specifically designed to investigate whether certain patients (for example those with renal artery stenosis &gt; 70% or severe bilateral stenosis, rapidly deteriorating renal function, or flash pulmonary oedema) may be more likely to benefit clinically from angioplasty would also be useful. Additional studies should be carried out to determine whether investigations, such as Doppler ultrasound waveform analysis, may aid in the identification of patients with true reno-vascular hypertension who may be more likely to benefit from revascularisation. The following outcome parameters should be considered for any future study: 1) serum creatinine, creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate; 2) systolic and diastolic blood pressure; 3) cardiovascular and renal adverse events; 4) numbers of antihypertensive medications; and 5) peri-procedural complications. A cost-effectiveness analysis, taking into account patient preference, would also be desirable.</P>

<P>The following outcomes could be ascertained from this study:<BR/>Mean differences in office BP and differences in serum creatinine<BR/>Mean BP decreased by 14/5 mm Hg in the BA group, and by 4/3 mm Hg in the MT group, when results of patients with uni- and bilateral stenoses were combined (19/4 in BA group, and 2/2 mm Hg in the MT group with bilateral, and 9/5 in the BA group, and 8/6 mm Hg in the MT group with unilateral stenosis)<BR/>Mean serum creatinine increased by 5 µmol/L in the BA group, and by 22 µmol/L in the MT group (combined for uni- and bilateral stenosis)<BR/>No statistically significant difference in number of antihypertensive drugs (exact number of antihypertensive drugs not indicated)<BR/>No significant difference in DDD between groups (no exact numbers given)<BR/>Restenosis and complication rates could not be used for analysis since they were not reported separately for randomised and non-randomised patients (complications of BA occurred in 25 randomised and in 15 non-randomised patients: significant bleeding at the arterial site in 20%, and pain requiring administration of narcotic analgesics in 10%). Study was originally restricted to patients with bilateral stenosis, but subsequently extended to patients with unilateral disease. For analysis results from patients with bi- and unilateral renal artery stenoses were pooled together</P>
