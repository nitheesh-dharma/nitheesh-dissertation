Prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body (called metastases) including the bones. Bone fractures and compression of the spinal cord are feared complications in addition to death due to prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates are medicines that interact with the formation of new bone and might be useful to prevent the men from experiencing bone pain, fractures or other skeletal complications. We focused this review on pain because pain frequently occurs and can restrict the daily life activities and might require further treatment.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We searched medical databases to 13 July 2017. Two review authors independently screened, summarized and analyzed the findings. This led to the inclusion of 18 clinical trials.</P><P><B>Key results </B></P><P>We found low quality evidence that bisphosphonates provided no clinically relevant difference in pain response (three studies involving 876 men) compared to placebo (pretend treatment) or no additional treatment.

Bisphosphonates showed no clear difference in the number of men who died or the number of men with decreased use of pain killers. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with nausea. Bisphosphonates resulted in seven more men with nausea per 1000 men (0 fewer to 14 more). We found moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with kidney problems. In this case, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more men with renal complications per 1000 men (4 more to 50 more). For osteonecrosis of the jaw (where the jaw bone weakens and dies), we found very low quality evidence that bisphosphonates showed no clear difference. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably decreased the number of men affected by disease progression (where the disease got worse). This means that bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer men with disease progression per 1000 men (71 fewer to 7 fewer). We found no useable data on quality of life.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>We judged the quality of evidence as moderate to very low.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-12-18 09:27:14 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="Alea J Miller"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-12-15 11:28:09 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The prevalence and incidence of pain and skeletal complications of metastatic bone disease such as pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia is high and an important contributor to morbidity, poor performance status and decreased quality of life.

Approximately 1.1 million men worldwide were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>). The reported age-adjusted incidence rate of prostate cancer in the US was 137.9 per 100,000 from 2008 to 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2015</LINK>). Mortality was 21.4 per 100,000 persons per year from 2008 to 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2015</LINK>). About 80% of men with advanced prostate cancer develop bone metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Bubendorf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bubendorf 2000</LINK>).</P><P>The prevalence and incidence of skeletal complications of metastatic bone disease such as bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia is high and an important contributor to morbidity, poor performance status and decreased quality of life (QoL) (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1997</LINK>). Despite the bone metastases themselves, androgen deprivation therapy, which is often given to men with bone metastases, is known to reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Alibhai-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alibhai 2017</LINK>). As pathologic fractures are associated with increased risk of death in men with malignant bone disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fizazi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fizazi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK>), preventing fractures is an important goal in men with prostate cancer at risk for skeletal complications.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:55:53 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Therapeutic options for men with bone metastases are bone-modifying agents such as bisphosphonates or inhibitors of RANK-ligands (receptor activator of NF-&#954;B ligand) (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2012</LINK>).</P><P>The clinical use of bisphosphonates started in the 1970s for the treatment of Paget disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2003</LINK>). Since then, their effectiveness has been shown in other diseases, including osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma and bone metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Devogelaer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devogelaer 2000</LINK>). More than 70% of people with hypercalcemia of malignancy responded to bisphosphonate treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2004</LINK>). Meta-analyses have also shown their effectiveness in reducing pain, bone loss and vertebral fractures in people with multiple myeloma (<LINK REF="REF-Mhaskar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mhaskar 2012</LINK>) and breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2012</LINK>). The mechanism through which bisphosphonates prevent fractures and therefore bone pain is related to the inhibition of disease-induced, osteoclast-mediated bone loss (<LINK REF="REF-Clohisy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clohisy 2002</LINK>). Nowadays, there are hints that despite the bone resorption properties, bisphosphonates even have a preventive potential against breast and colon cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Newcomb-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomb 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thosani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thosani 2013</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events of the intervention</HEADING><P>Bisphosphonates might have beneficial effects, but they are associated with adverse events. These can be structured according to affected organs. Bisphosphonates might increase the risk of atypical femur fracture or osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) as skeletal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellstein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstein 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>). Bisphosphonates are associated with a prevalence of approximately 0.10% agent-induced ONJ (<LINK REF="REF-Hellstein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstein 2011</LINK>). Non-skeletal adverse events might affect the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>). Two percent to 10% of people receiving bisphosphonates experience nausea, emesis, diarrhea or gastric pain (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>). Additional reported gastrointestinal complications are esophagitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>). Other non-skeletal adverse events probably caused by bisphosphonates are hypocalcemia or reduction of renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2014</LINK>). In particular, intravenous (IV) administration of bisphosphonates seems to be associated with an increased risk of renal impairment and requires hemostasis of the person's fluid balance (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-12-07 09:48:51 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="Alea J Miller"><P>Bisphosphonates are analogues of pyrophosphate and they target osteoclastic cells. They can be subgrouped to amino-bisphosphonates or non-amino-bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Examples for amino-bisphosphonates are zoledronate, risedronate, pamidronate and alendronate. They affect osteoclast metabolism by targeting farnesyl diphosphate synthase, which is responsible for post-translational modification of guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>). The group of non-amino-bisphosphonates includes etidronate, clodronate and tiludronate. These substances function by forming an analog of adenosine triphosphate. The resulting metabolite has toxic properties and induces apoptosis of osteoclasts (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 2016</LINK>). Both groups of bisphosphonates inhibit the effect of prostacyclins and cytokines in bone tissue and reduce the number of osteoclasts by downregulation of the reticuloendothelial system (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2007</LINK>). They also bind hydroxyapatite in bone matrix (<LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2015</LINK>).</P><P>Addressing pharmacokinetics, orally administered bisphosphonates have a low bioavailability, which can even be decreased by concomitant consumption of calcium-containing food (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>). Consequently, oral bisphosphonates should not be taken with food or milk, but with water with a low content of calcium.

The decision-making process for prevention of pain and skeletal-related events (SREs) in men with prostate cancer and bone metastases is usually challenging men and their physicians, as there are deviating recommendations on different approaches of bone-modifying agents in national and international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Conford-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conford 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2016</LINK>). One systematic review on the use of bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer described an increased risk for ONJ (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2015</LINK> found that bisphosphonates reduced the incidence of SREs.

One systematic review from <LINK REF="REF-Vignani-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignani 2016</LINK> and colleagues. emphasized that zoledronate has no impact on overall survival. All of these systematic reviews frequently focused on clinically important outcomes, but did not assess information on patient-important outcomes (e.g. pain or QoL). Most of these systematic reviews performed descriptive analysis and only two provided data from pooled data analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK>). None of the systematic reviews used the GRADE approach. In awareness of these weaknesses, we carried out an update of this review considering patient-important outcomes and conducted this Cochrane Review using the GRADE approach.</P><P>The aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of bisphosphonates compared to placebo or no treatment or compared to chemotherapy. By systematically identifying all randomized trials and critically reviewing their reliability and validity considering similar trials in the meta-analysis, we overcame statistical limitations of individual studies. This comprehensive overview is necessary for clinical decision making, and it will have a great impact on international guidelines and clinical pathways. Moreover, it will contribute to a high-grade decision support for effective therapeutic strategies for the individual person.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Current guidelines and recommendations</HEADING><P>Although bone-targeted therapy is common in men with prostate cancer at risk for skeletal complications, recommendations in current guidelines are inconsistent. The guidelines by the European Association of Urology and by the German Oncologic Guidelines Program recommend the usage of zoledronic acid or the RANK-ligand-inhibitor, denosumab, in men with advanced, relapsed or castration-resistant prostate cancer, with no evidence to demonstrate greater efficacy of one drug over another (<LINK REF="REF-Conford-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conford 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2016</LINK>). The guidelines by the American Urology Association (AUA) and the guidelines by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest denosumab or zoledronic acid for men with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk for clinically relevant SREs (<LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horwich-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horwich 2013</LINK>). Neither the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (<LINK REF="REF-Mohler-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohler 2016</LINK>) nor the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzpatrick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzpatrick 2014</LINK>) give strong recommendations to use denosumab or bisphosphonates for SREs in men with prostate cancer. </P><P>Even though bisphosphonates are recognized as a reliable treatment option in bone metastases from prostate cancer, there is disagreement whether potentially beneficial effects would be outweighed by adverse events. In this context, the choice of the bisphosphonate is still a subject of discussion. In consideration of the presented guidelines, zoledronic acid might be the drug of choice. This review analyzed data of different bisphosphonates to determine the advantages and disadvantages.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:20 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effects of bisphosphonates in men with bone metastases from castration-resistant or castration-sensitive prostate cancer.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2017-12-07 08:20:37 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="Alea J Miller"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:56:16 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:20 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without any language restrictions.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer accounted for most cancers. The group of bisphosphonates included zoledronate (seven trials), clodronate (six trials), risedronate (two trials), alendronate (one trial), pamidronate (one trial) and etidronate (one trial). Current German, American and European guidelines recommend zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications and for bone pain relief in participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Conford-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conford 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wirth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 2016</LINK>). Hence, zoledronic acid is the most frequently used bisphosphonate in clinical practice. On the contrary, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has still not approved clodronate (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Amm-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Amm 2016</LINK>). Clodronate was included in one third of all trials, but plays a minor role in clinical routine. Overall, this review answered the review question considering different subgroups of participants with advanced prostate cancer and different types of bisphosphonates.</P><P>Pain frequently occurs in men with bone metastasis from prostate cancer and its control is one target in palliative therapy. Consequently, the proportion of participants with pain response has been defined as primary outcome of this review and the meta-analysis. Pooled data analysis consisted of three trials with 876 participants. We found a low quality of evidence and observed no clear difference in pain response between bisphosphonates and control. This finding might have been influenced by differing end point definitions in the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1989</LINK> provided no definition and <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 2003</LINK> considered disease progression as 'pain event.' <LINK REF="STD-Meulenbeld-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meulenbeld 2012</LINK> defined an at least 2- point reduction from baseline PPI score without increase in analgesic class or decrease in analgesic class without increased PPI score as pain response. Noteworthy, the three trials used different bisphosphonates: clodronate (<LINK REF="STD-Ernst-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 2003</LINK>), risedronate (<LINK REF="STD-Meulenbeld-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meulenbeld 2012</LINK>), and etidronate (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1989</LINK>) and all participants had castration-resistant prostate cancer. Zoledronate is the most frequently used bisphosphonate in men with prostate cancer, but none of the studies with participants receiving zoledronic acid could be included in the statistical synthesis. Descriptive analysis revealed that in two trials participants receiving zoledronic acid presented with clinically relevant lower pain scores in comparison with placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Abetz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abetz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK>). As zoledronate is the clinically most important bisphosphonate, applicability of our quantitative results on pain response is restricted to participants receiving clodronate, risedronate and etidronate. To clarify the role of zoledronic acid in pain management in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer, future studies should evaluate pain response by clearly mentioning the proportion of participants with pain response, defining pain response and providing clear definitions of pain response. Further analyses in participants with bone metastases from treatment-naive or castration-sensitive prostate cancer are needed, as we could not include any of the fours trials reporting on this subset of participants (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-90202" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 90202</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PR05" TYPE="STUDY">PR05</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZABTON_x002d_PC" TYPE="STUDY">ZABTON-PC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZAPCA" TYPE="STUDY">ZAPCA</LINK>).</P><P>Bone metastases may result in SREs. Pooled data analysis of SREs showed that bisphosphonates probably decreased the total number of SREs. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that zoledronic acid probably delayed the onset of SREs and four out of five studies included in the meta-analysis compared zoledronic acid to control groups. These findings derived from trials reporting on participants with either castration-resistant or castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Finally, zoledronic acid probably increased the time to any SRE and decreased the number of SREs in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer.</P><P>SREs were defined as a composite outcome consisting of pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, bone surgery or bone radiation. From the man's perspective, these are less or more important. The differing relevance predominantly arises from the restrictions in daily life activities. Hence, acute interventions (surgery or radiation) might be rated as more important than an asymptomatic fracture or spinal cord compression. Considering this, zoledronic acid might contribute to the man's daily life activities by reducing SREs in general and especially surgical interventions to bone. Future analyses of SREs would be more beneficial if they stratify the relevance of SREs and take the man's perspective as a correlated outcome into account.</P><P>The trials heterogeneously assessed QoL by using different measurement tools and explored different dimensions of the man's daily life considering, for example, mobility, disability or pain. In doing so, each study focused on different facets of QoL. QoL assessment might be important for the man and the physician, because it allows detection of deficiencies of anticancer therapy, evaluation of treatment response and some type of patient satisfaction. Our analysis highlighted the limited applicability of QoL data from each trial and emphasized the need for further research on this outcome. Future studies should evaluate QoL by clearly mentioning the proportion of participants with changed QoL and providing clear definitions of QoL. We recommend the use of one standardized questionnaire to raise external validity of results.</P><P>Bisphosphonates are associated with a potential nephrotoxic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Bartl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2014</LINK>). Meta-analysis of seven trials revealed that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of renal adverse events in comparison with control regimens. Analyzing each study separately, only <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK> showed a clear difference in the occurrence of renal adverse events, the other trials demonstrated no clinically relevant difference between groups (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-90202" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 90202</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elomaa-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Elomaa 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Figg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Figg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kylmala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kylmala 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZAPCA" TYPE="STUDY">ZAPCA</LINK>). In overall analysis, most of the observed events derived from <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK> and the weight of this trial was 89.1%. Four trials used zoledronic acid 4 mg IV (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-90202" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 90202</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZAPCA" TYPE="STUDY">ZAPCA</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK> added a zoledronic acid 8 mg IV arm, but, after an increase in renal adverse events in this arm, Saad and colleagues amended the initial dose from zoledronic acid 8 mg to 4 mg (8/4 mg group). For meta-analysis, we initially planned to combine results of bisphosphonate or control participants from three- or four-armed trials. This approach allowed us to compare two-armed trials to three- or four-armed trials, but might have also led to misleading results in this outcome.</P><P>The rates of renal adverse events were 15.2% with zoledronic acid 4 mg versus 20.7% with zoledronic acid 8/4 mg versus 11.5% with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK>. The authors reported that participants receiving zoledronate 4 mg IV had an RR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.46 to 2.47; P = 0.882) in comparison with placebo, but the corresponding RR was 1.76 (95% CI 0.79 to 3.93, P = 0.165) for the zoledronic acid 8/4 mg group. Noteworthy, zoledronic acid 4 mg, which represents the clinical standard dose, was not associated with a clinically relevant increase in renal adverse events in <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-90202" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 90202</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-ZAPCA" TYPE="STUDY">ZAPCA</LINK>. Given the facts that the temporary high dose of zoledronic acid 8 mg might have influenced the overall effect, <LINK REF="STD-Saad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 2010</LINK> contributed more than 90% of renal adverse events and had the most sensitive definition of renal adverse events, future studies should address the nephrotoxic effects of zoledronic acid 4 mg in the context of a homogeneous outcome definition. The inclusion of the zoledronic acid 8/4 mg group in the analysis of renal adverse events restricted the applicability of our results, therefore, these should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, participants with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bisphosphonates other than zoledronate were under-represented in our analysis. Future studies should evaluate the renal toxicity of different bisphosphonates in these participants in the near future.</P><P>We included seven trials in statistical analysis of disease progression. Definition of disease progression included biochemical progression (PSA progression), radiographic progression (new or expanding bone lesions) and clinical progression in these trials. Clinical progression mainly included pain progression and increased analgesic consumption, but some studies also considered SREs and death due to prostate cancer. Given this heterogeneity in outcome definition, the observed probable reduction of the proportion of participants with disease progression on bisphosphonate treatment must be interpreted carefully. This finding does not reflect the clinical importance of the use of bisphosphonates, as physicians do not treat biochemical results only clinical findings. From the man's perspective, biochemical progression or radiographic progression might not be experienced as discomfort or might not immediately affect survival. On the contrary, the man's daily life activities might be impaired by increased bone pain or need for treatment of disease progression (e.g. radiation or surgery to bone). As the relevance of our finding remains uncertain in the context of the man's perspective, we emphasize the need for new studies taking the man's view into account for the measurement of disease progression.</P><P>In addition to the published trials, we checked registries to identify ongoing clinical trials. We found no ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, the current evidence will not change in the near future.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:21 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. Overall, we judged the quality of the 18 studies included as moderate. In detail, the quality of evidence for pain response was low because the studies were at a potential risk of performance and attrition bias and included a small number of events (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We considered the quality of evidence for SREs, mortality, nausea, renal adverse events and disease progression as moderate due to the potential bias by influence of funding sources. Consequently, we downgraded each of these outcomes by one point. We downgraded ONJ by three points, resulting in very low quality evidence. This is justified by the risk of performance and attrition bias in the trials and the very small number of events included in this outcome analysis. We were unable to judge the quality of evidence for QoL, because the studies did not report this outcome in a way allowing a meta-analysis.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:21 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We used different strategies to minimize the risk of bias in the review process. We performed a highly sensitive literature search considering full-text and abstract publications from medical databases and cancer congresses. We checked study registries to identify completed but unpublished trials. In doing so, we potentially missed unpublished, ongoing or not completed trials. If results of these trials are going to be published in the future, we will consider them in an update of this systematic review.</P><P>Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility. They separately performed data extraction and analysis. During the review process, we produced funnel plots. None of the defined end points had at least 10 studies in the analysis and therefore, this statistical analysis could not be performed. Addressing analysis of defined end points, the trials used different methods in QoL assessment. Because of the deviation in reported data, we were unable to obtain data to meta-analyze, but performed a qualitative outcome analysis.</P><P>The current analysis is an update of the initial review on the use of bisphosphonates in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. By nature, updates of systematic reviews are often prepared without providing a specific protocol, which defines the methodologic background of the review. This could lead to a potential sources of bias, for example, in selection criteria of studies included or end point definitions. This updated review differs from the prior version by including all trials using bisphosphonates in prostate cancer participants irrespective of outcomes. The first version only included studies reporting on pain response in these participants. Furthermore, we did not provide data on the comparison of different routes of administration or dosages of bisphosphonates. According to the protocol of the prior version of the review, we initially identified three trials comparing different doses and types of bisphosphonates, but these studies were designed heterogeneously. In the final analysis, we excluded these trials due to potentially imbalanced results with restricted applicability.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-04 04:23:34 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Lee and colleagues evaluated the risk of ONJ in people with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>). The study included 1389 participants receiving bisphosphonates and 569,620 receiving a control regimen from eight observational studies. In their systematic review, they found an increased risk for participants receiving bisphosphonates (odds ratio (OR) 4.25, 95% CI 3.67 to 5.36). The risk was increased further in participants receiving IV bisphosphonates (OR 4.27, 95 % CI 3.38 to 5.40) compared to participants receiving bisphosphonates orally (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.56). We included five studies in the analysis of ONJ, but only two trials documented events. The number of participants in experimental groups was almost similar in both systematic reviews, but our quantitative analysis revealed no clear difference in the rate of ONJ (RR: 1.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 4.90, very low quality of evidence). This clinically relevant deviation is surprising, even though Lee and colleagues included different types of primary cancer and should be addressed in future investigations on this topic.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015</LINK> and colleagues evaluated the role of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of any SREs in participants with lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and bone metastases. Although they included only seven trials for the analysis of men with prostate cancer, their results are in line with ours, saying that bisphosphonates reduced the risk of SREs in these participants (OR for men with prostate cancer 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). In their analysis, Liu and colleagues calculated ORs and used a random-effects model. On the contrary, we calculated RRs and used a fixed-effect model. Moreover, Liu and coworkers defined SREs "as pathologic bone fracture, the bone surgery, the bone radiation therapy, or change in anticancer therapy to relieve bone pain." These discrepancies might have caused the more distinct effect of bisphosphonates on SREs in their analysis in comparison with our analysis.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2015</LINK> conducted a systematic review on bone-targeted therapies in men with prostate cancer with bone metastases. The authors concluded that zoledronic acid reduced the number of SREs and the time to SREs in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, <LINK REF="REF-Alibhai-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alibhai 2017</LINK> carried out a systematic review on the use of bone-targeted therapies in men with prostate cancer. In summary, the authors reported that zoledronic acid delayed the time to SRE and prevented participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer from SRE development. On the one hand, results of the <LINK REF="REF-Alibhai-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alibhai 2017</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gartrell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartrell 2015</LINK> reviews were in line with our findings.

Only <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2014</LINK> (zoledronic acid) and <LINK REF="STD-PR05" TYPE="STUDY">PR05</LINK> (clodronate) detected an improved survival in participants receiving bisphosphonates, all other trials showed similar survival data for both groups.</P><P>None of the identified and discussed reviews used the GRADE approach. As presented, the systematic reviews focused on SRE, survival and ONJ, but provided no data on patient-important outcomes such as pain, analgesic consumption or QoL. A further advantage of this Cochrane Review was the consideration of men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-12-07 15:19:57 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="Alea J Miller"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-12-07 15:19:57 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="Alea J Miller"><P>This systematic review found low quality evidence that there is no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of participants with pain response between bisphosphonates and control regimens in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Our analysis revealed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates decreased the total number of skeletal-related events and the proportion of participants with disease progression in comparison with control regimens. The advantageous effect of bisphosphonates on the composite outcome of skeletal-related events was more distinct in pathologic fractures, spinal cord compressions and bone surgery. The benefits should be weighed against the risk of renal impairment and nausea in men receiving bisphosphonates. We found very low to moderate quality evidence that there is no clear difference in mortality, quality of life and osteonecrosis of the jaw using bisphosphonates in contrast to control regimens.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:21 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our review enlightened the need for more patient-important data, especially for pain and quality of life. To support further research on pain and quality of life in these men, we recommend the use of standardized assessment tools. As the primary outcome pain was assessed by only including bisphosphonates other than zoledronic acid, further research is needed on the analgesic potential of zoledronic acid as it is the predominantly used bisphosphonate in clinical practice. Future studies might investigate the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw as typical adverse event in people receiving bisphosphonates and preventional strategies. A higher number of events may raise the quality of evidence of this outcome in a following update of this review. More research is needed to evaluate cost effectiveness. In addition, information is needed to guide the choice of bisphosphonates and the optimal treatment schedule.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-12-04 03:23:21 -0600" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors of the first version of this review would like to thank Mrs Bernadette Coles MSc for developing and running the search strategies for this review.</P><P>We thank the authors of the first published version of this review, Mike Shelley, Wai Man Sze, Timothy J Wilt and Malcolm D Mason.</P><P>We thank the Cochrane Urology Group for their support, including the editors for their feedback on this review.
