<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are antibiotics useful for the treatment of peptic ulcer (ulcers in the stomach or upper small intestine) in people with <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> (<I>H. pylori</I>) infection?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Peptic ulcers are caused by acidic stomach juices damaging the lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or upper small intestine (duodenal ulcer). This causes pain, indigestion and sometimes, bleeding. Ulcers can return after being healed, especially if the person is infected with <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> (a lifelong infection unless treated). <I>H. pylori</I> causes most peptic ulcers. It is not clear whether eradicating <I>H.pylori</I> by treating with antibiotics as part of a combination of drugs (<I>H.pylori</I> eradication therapy) is helpful in the treatment of people with peptic ulcers compared to no treatment or other medical treatments. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in 2006.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Fifty-five studies provided information for the review. Thirty-four studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy plus ulcer-healing drug against ulcer-healing drug alone in the healing of duodenal ulcer. Two studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in the healing of duodenal ulcer. Fifteen studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy plus ulcer-healing drug against ulcer-healing drug alone in the healing of gastric ulcer. Three studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy plus ulcer-healing drug against ulcer-healing drug alone in the healing of peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal ulcer). One study compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in the healing of peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal ulcer). Four studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against ulcer-healing drug in preventing the recurrence of duodenal ulcer after initial ulcer had been healed. Twenty-seven studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in preventing the recurrence of duodenal ulcer after initial ulcer had been healed. Twelve studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in preventing the recurrence of gastric ulcer after initial ulcer had been healed, while one study compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in preventing the recurrence of peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal ulcer) after initial ulcer had been healed. Four studies compared <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy plus ulcer-healing drug versus comparison regimen in the relief of symptoms from peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal ulcer). There were no studies comparing <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against no treatment in the healing of gastric ulcer, <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy against ulcer-healing drug as maintenance therapy in preventing the recurrence of gastric ulcer after initial ulcer had been healed, or <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy plus ulcer-healing drug against no treatment or ulcer-healing drug in the relief of symptoms in people with peptic ulcer. Some trials provided information for more than one comparison. The evidence is current until March 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Adding a one to two-week course of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy speeds up ulcer healing for people with <I>H. pylori-</I>positive duodenal ulcer when compared to ulcer-healing drugs alone and no treatment. <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer (ulcer returning after initial healing) compared to no treatment. There is currently no evidence that <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is an effective treatment in people with gastric ulcer or that it is effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcer compared to ulcer-healing drugs. However, because of the small number of studies included for the last two comparisons, significant benefits or harms of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy in acute ulcer healing of gastric ulcers compared to no treatment and in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcers compared to ulcer healing drugs cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low or very low because most of the studies had errors in study design. As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the results.</P>

<P>Peptic ulcer disease is the cause of dyspepsia in about 10% of people. Ninety-five percent of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with <I>Helicobacter pylori</I>. Eradication of <I>H. pylori</I> reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. This is an update of Ford AC, Delaney B, Forman D, Moayyedi P.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, we identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to March 2016) and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to March 2016). To identify further relevant trials, we handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching, and published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in <I>Gut</I>) and Digestive Disease Week (published in <I>Gastroenterology</I>). The search was last updated in March 2016. We contacted members of Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases, and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-21 14:41:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We analysed randomised controlled trials of short- and long-term treatment of peptic ulcer disease in <I>H. pylori</I>-positive adults. Participants received at least one week of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or no treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from two weeks onwards.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We collected data on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) based on intention-to-treat analysis as far as possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 55 trials were included for one or more outcomes for this review.</P>
<P>In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 participants, RR of ulcer persisting = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.76; 381/2286 (adjusted proportion: 12.4%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 304/1624 (18.7%) in UHD; low quality evidence) and no treatment (two trials, 207 participants, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.53; 30/125 (adjusted proportion: 21.7%) in eradication therapy versus 48/82 (58.5%) in no treatment; low quality evidence). </P>
<P>In gastric ulcer healing, the differences were imprecise between eradication therapy and UHD (15 trials, 1974 participants, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68; 220/1192 (adjusted proportion: 16.0%) in eradication therapy plus UHD versus 102/782 (13.0%) in UHD; very low quality evidence). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence the differences were imprecise between maintenance therapy with <I>H.pylori</I> eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (four trials, 319 participants, RR of ulcer recurring 0.73; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; 19/159 (adjusted proportion: 11.9%) in eradication therapy versus 26/160 (16.3%) in UHD; very low quality evidence), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 participants, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 215/1501 (adjusted proportion: 12.9%) in eradication therapy versus 649/1008 (64.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). </P>
<P>In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (12 trials, 1476 participants, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45; 116/697 (adjusted proportion: 16.3%) in eradication therapy versus 356/679 (52.4%) in no treatment; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported proportion of people with gastric ulcer not healed after initial therapy between <I>H.pylori</I> eradication therapy and no active treatment or the proportion of people with recurrent gastric ulcer or peptic ulcers during maintenance therapy between <I>H.pylori</I> eradication therapy and ulcer healing drug therapy. <BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peptic ulcer disease is common, with some 10% of the population of Western countries likely to suffer a duodenal or gastric ulcer during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Dobrilla-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobrilla 1993</LINK>). The annual estimated national costs were USD 3.1 billion in United States, USD 29 to USD 94 million in Sweden in 1998 and USD 522 million in France in 1987 (<LINK REF="REF-Barkun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkun 2010</LINK>). Those suffering from peptic ulcer disease can be troubled by recurrent bouts of pain, in addition to more serious consequences such as haemorrhage or perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Penston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penston 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until the recognition of the major role played by <I>Helicobacter pylori</I>, the most important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease were thought to be acid and pepsin damaging the epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum (<LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-21 14:41:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Triple therapy regimens (acid suppressing therapy combined with two antibiotics aimed at eradicating <I>H. pylori</I>) given for one week are said to achieve rapid symptom relief and healing rates of approximately 90% of duodenal ulcers and 85% of gastric ulcers, with studies suggesting this is more effective than antisecretory drugs alone (<LINK REF="REF-Penston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penston 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, people receiving successful <I>H. pylori</I> eradication had a relapse rate of approximately 5% compared with 80% of those healed on histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (<LINK REF="REF-Penston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penston 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initially triple therapy was instituted using bismuth salts and antibiotics, but subsequent trials replaced the bismuth with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and discovered that this was better tolerated, and achieved similar rates of eradication of <I>H. pylori </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1997</LINK>). Despite these advances, and numerous narrative reviews on <I>H. pylori </I>eradication in peptic ulcer disease, we were not aware of a recent systematic review evaluating duodenal and gastric ulcers separately.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-18 10:49:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>In the 1970s and 1980s therapy was mainly aimed at reducing acid secretion, achieved by the use of H2RAs and PPIs (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1995</LINK>). However in the late 1980s and early 1990s the importance of <I>H. pylori </I>in ulcer development and recurrence was confirmed, and it was postulated that this could be prevented by eradication of this organism (<LINK REF="REF-Tytgat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tytgat 1998</LINK>), which is implicated in 90% to 95% of duodenal and approximately 70% of gastric ulcers.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to obtain a more precise estimate of the efficacy of eradication therapy in the short- and long-term treatment of <I>H. pylori</I>-positive individuals with peptic ulcer disease. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2006</LINK>). The previous version concluded that a one to two-week course of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is an effective treatment for <I>H. pylori</I>-positive peptic ulcer disease. Since the search was outdated, it is important to provide up-to-date evidence.</P>

Overall 15% of gastric ulcers recurred in the <I>H. pylori </I>eradication group compared with 52% in the no treatment group. There was statistically significant heterogeneity between trial results (heterogeneity test (11 degrees of freedom) Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 29.09, P = 0.002) and a random effects model was used. There was a statistically significant benefit of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy compared to no treatment in the prevention of gastric ulcer recurrence (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>) (NNTB = 3; 95% CI 2 to 5). Egger test revealed a trend towards funnel plot asymmetry (P = 0.07) with a preponderance of trials with few events showing large effects when 1/standard error was used as a measure of study size (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Metaregression was performed to evaluate whether length of treatment in the control group, duration of eradication therapy, eradication rate, length of follow-up, number of centres, method of randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding, intention-to-treat analysis and completeness of follow-up had any impact on the result that could explain some of the heterogeneity observed. This revealed that only concealment of allocation had any impact on effect size (RR of recurrence increased if concealment of allocation present (log RR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.77 P &lt; 0.001)).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-11 13:11:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most important finding of this review concerns the ulcer recurrence rate of people with duodenal or gastric ulcer treated with <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy compared to those given a short-term course of ulcer-healing drug. There was a significant relative risk reduction of 80% in the recurrence of duodenal ulcer, and a slightly smaller but still significant risk ratio reduction of 69% for gastric ulcer. The difference in results between duodenal and gastric ulcer probably reflects the lower control relapse rate seen in the latter disease. In addition, one week of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy appears to be at least as effective as maintenance therapy with ulcer-healing drug in the recurrence of duodenal ulcer. This review also finds that <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy has a small benefit over ulcer-healing drug, and a larger benefit over no treatment or placebo in the healing of duodenal ulcer. This does not appear to be the case in the healing of gastric ulcer, where our results show a slight increase in healing rates with ulcer-healing drug alone. Overall <I>H. pylori</I> eradication rate in all trials was 68%. Finally, there appears to be no significant improvement in relief of symptoms of peptic ulcer disease with <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy over comparison regimen, although the number of trials that report this outcome is small. There are also no studies that have evaluated symptoms beyond six weeks, and it is the long-term effect of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication on peptic ulcer disease symptoms that is important. These advantages are offset by an increased incidence of short-term side effects. People receiving eradication therapy report a higher incidence of side effects, with a greater than two-fold increase in the risk of adverse events in people assigned to comparison regimen rather than <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy. Although these unwanted effects are only short-term they may be significant (<LINK REF="REF-Moayyedi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moayyedi 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-18 10:49:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Further trials comparing <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy with placebo in the healing of gastric ulcer disease are required. In addition, more trials reporting the effect of eradication therapy on symptoms arising from peptic ulcer are required.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 07:42:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>Only a small proportion of all trials identified were of high quality, in terms of their reporting of the methods used to generate the randomisation sequence and conceal treatment allocation. In addition, a significant number did not report losses to follow-up completely and could not be judged to be free from selective reporting. Details of these issues are provided in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-25 07:43:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>We have explored reasons for heterogeneity in the results using metaregression. These results need to be interpreted with caution as metaregression evaluates the average of patient characteristics within each trial and is open to giving spurious results due to the ecological fallacy (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1998</LINK>). Nevertheless the finding that effects size was reduced in trials with adequate concealment of allocation in the long term gastric ulcer recurrence trials, and effect size increased with absence of blinding in short term gastric ulcer healing trials, is consistent with previous reports of the general systematic review literature (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). The reduction of effect size with intention-to-treat analysis in the long-term duodenal and gastric ulcer recurrence trials is also consistent with this literature (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>) and the increase in effect size with increasing eradication rate is biologically plausible.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-21 14:42:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>These findings support the recommendations of the European <I>Helicobacter pylori </I>Study Group (EHPSG) and the American Gastroenterological Association, both of which recommend a recognised course of <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy for the treatment of <I>H. pylori</I>-positive peptic ulcer disease (<LINK REF="REF-Howden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howden 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malfertheiner-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malfertheiner 2002b</LINK>). This approach is also advocated from a health economic perspective from models (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imperiale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperiale 1995</LINK>) and also a randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sonnenberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sonnenberg 1998</LINK>), all of which show a reduced use of ulcer-related health care resources compared to conventional ulcer-healing drug therapy in subsequent follow-up.</P>
<P>Two systematic reviews have previously been conducted in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Leodolter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leodolter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1994</LINK>). Both these reviews reported a greater benefit from<I> H. pylori </I>eradication therapy in peptic ulcer disease than our review. In the earlier of these studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1994</LINK>), ulcer-healing rates of 90% to 95% with<I> H. pylori </I>eradication therapy were reported, compared to 75% to 85% in our review, and ulcer-recurrence rates of less than 10%, compared to 12% to 15%. The more recent (<LINK REF="REF-Leodolter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leodolter 2001</LINK>) quoted healing rates of 87% to 93% and recurrence rates of 2% to 3%. This could be accounted for by our use of intention-to-treat data. We assumed all participants lost to follow-up in the trials were treatment failures, whereas the authors of the two previous studies only used intention-to-treat data where reported.</P>
<P>The study by Moore was performed in 1994 and there has been considerable information published in the interim period. In addition, the study author did not perform a separate analysis for duodenal and gastric ulcers, but amalgamated results into an overall healing and recurrence rate for peptic ulcers. The later meta-analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Leodolter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leodolter 2001</LINK> has several differences from our review. Firstly, it was designed to reveal the efficacy of eradication therapy in healing and preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcer compared to gastric ulcer. This means that articles were only eligible for inclusion if they contained data for both duodenal and gastric ulcer healing or recurrence, reported separately. Secondly, in order to 'limit' the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the healing analysis only trials that used PPI-based eradication regimens were used. Finally, there were several non-randomised or uncontrolled studies, or both included in the analysis. Neither of these two previous reviews reported data for symptom relief or adverse events. We have addressed all these issues in our review.</P>

<P>Adding a one to two-week course of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is an effective treatment for people with <I>H. pylori-</I>positive duodenal ulcer when compared to ulcer-healing drugs alone and no treatment. <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is also effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer compared to no treatment. There is currently no evidence that <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy is an effective treatment in people with gastric ulcer or that it is effective in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcer compared to ulcer-healing drug. However, confidence intervals were wide and significant benefits or harms of <I>H. pylori</I> eradication therapy in acute ulcer healing of gastric ulcers compared to no treatment and in preventing recurrence of duodenal ulcers compared to ulcer healing drugs cannot be ruled out.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-06-13 10:10:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has identified some directions for further research. In the future, papers should state the method of randomisation, allocation of concealment, and masking more clearly. More trials are needed to evaluate <I>H. pylori </I>eradication therapy in the healing of gastric ulcer disease, particularly comparing antibiotic therapy with placebo. Finally, there has been little data on symptom relief and quality of life changes and this should be addressed.</P>
