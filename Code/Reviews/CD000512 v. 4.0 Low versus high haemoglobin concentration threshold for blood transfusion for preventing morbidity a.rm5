<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-10 11:29:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very premature infants are extremely vulnerable and often require intensive care to survive. Anaemia is a condition in which the blood does not contain enough haemoglobin, the component of red blood cells which carries oxygen around the body. These babies become anaemic very quickly due to blood sampling and because they are unable to make blood cells quickly the haemoglobin level in the blood falls rapidly in the weeks after birth. Generally, the treatment for anaemia is blood transfusion, and many of these babies receive multiple transfusions of blood. The decision to give a transfusion usually depends on the measured amount of haemoglobin in the blood.</P>
<P>Physicians looking after very premature infants are unsure as to the level of haemoglobin at which they should give a transfusion. As transfusion is the introduction of another person's blood cells into the blood stream, there is a risk of infection and a risk of reaction to foreign blood components; the process requires careful monitoring and supervision to ensure safety. Some people find blood transfusion offensive or contrary to their religious values. Giving few or no transfusions reduces the risks of transfusion, but may result in low levels of haemoglobin and consequently a reduced supply of oxygen to the body which could have effects on survival, growth or development.</P>
<P>This review of five studies compares the effects of blood transfusion at low levels of haemoglobin to transfusion at high levels. Within the levels tested, there were no differences seen in survival, in the serious complications of prematurity, or in longer term development as measured at 18 to 21 months past the baby's due date. Allowing the baby to become a little more anaemic did not affect the baby's weight gain or breathing patterns. These conclusions are not firm, because too few babies have been studied. Our overall recommendation is not to exceed the higher levels of haemoglobin used in these trials, and thus diminish the risks of over-transfusion, but not to allow the level of haemoglobin to fall below the lower limits tested in these studies until further studies are completed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infants of very low birth weight often receive multiple transfusions of red blood cells, usually in response to predetermined haemoglobin or haematocrit thresholds. In the absence of better indices, haemoglobin levels are imperfect but necessary guides to the need for transfusion. Chronic anaemia in premature infants may, if severe, cause apnoea, poor neurodevelopmental outcomes or poor weight gain. On the other hand, red blood cell transfusion may result in transmission of infections, circulatory or iron overload, or dysfunctional oxygen carriage and delivery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-09 20:28:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials, enrolling a total of 614 infants, compared low (restrictive) to high (liberal) haemoglobin thresholds. Restrictive thresholds tended to be similar, but one trial used liberal thresholds much higher than the other three. There were no statistically significant differences in the combined outcomes of death or serious morbidity at first hospital discharge (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.49) or in component outcomes. Only the largest trial reported follow-up at 18 to 21 months corrected gestational age; in this study there was no statistically significant difference in a composite of death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). One additional trial comparing transfusion for clinical signs of anaemia versus transfusion at a set level of haemoglobin or haematocrit, reported no deaths and did not address disability.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of restrictive as compared to liberal haemoglobin thresholds in infants of very low birth weight results in modest reductions in exposure to transfusion and in haemoglobin levels. Restrictive practice does not appear to have a significant impact on death or major morbidities at first hospital discharge or at follow-up. However, given the uncertainties of these conclusions, it would be prudent to avoid haemoglobin levels below the lower limits tested here. Further trials are required to clarify the impact of transfusion practice on long term outcome.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The normal postnatal fall in haemoglobin concentration is greatly accelerated in infants of very low birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Wardrop-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardrop 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1984</LINK>). Anaemia of prematurity is caused by a combination of a suppressed postnatal response to erythropoietin and by rapid growth (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1984</LINK>), and is greatly exacerbated by clinically prescribed blood sampling (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchette-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchette 1984</LINK>). It is difficult to identify a single haemoglobin concentration level below which oxygen delivery may be inadequate. Oxygen consumption may be higher in the critically ill and when poor cardiorespiratory function reduces oxygen delivery, there may be a need for higher haemoglobin levels. Oxygen unloading to the tissues is greatly affected by the separate effects of acid-base balance, carbon dioxide tension and erythrocyte levels of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate on haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1984</LINK>). These effects are greatly amplified in adult rather than foetal haemoglobin, which is increased with transfusion as well as with postnatal age (<LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barkemeyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkemeyer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Failure of an adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues due to a low haemoglobin concentration may be compensated for by adjustments in cardiac output (limited in the newborn) (<LINK REF="REF-Lachance-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lachance 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alkalay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alkalay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cambonie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cambonie 2007</LINK>) and in haemoglobin function (<LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meldon-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meldon 1985</LINK>). However beyond a certain undefined point, it is likely that growth and development will be impaired. Long term effects of anaemia of the low birth weight infant have not been documented, and indications for treatment for signs of anaemia (tachycardia) (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>), poor weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1984a</LINK>) and apnoea (<LINK REF="STD-Ross-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1989</LINK>) have not been defined.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approaches to treating or preventing anaemia in very low birth weight infants include maximising placental transfusion at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hosono-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosono 2008</LINK>), strict limitation of blood sampling (<LINK REF="REF-Madan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venancio-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venancio 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mimica-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mimica 2008</LINK>) and red blood cell transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Miyashiro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyashiro 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2010</LINK>). An alternative or additional strategy is to use erythropoietin, as recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO); this is the subject of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Aher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aher 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aher-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aher 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2006</LINK>). Rates of blood transfusion for infants of very low birth weight are highest in the smallest infants and more than half of the transfusions are given in the first two weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Widness-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widness 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beeram-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeram 2001</LINK>). In the 1990s, about 40% of infants of &lt; 1500 g and 95% of those &lt; 1000 g birth weight received a blood transfusion. On average very low birth weight infants received between two and three transfusions each, and 30% of infants &lt; 1000 g birth weight received in excess of 10 transfusions each (<LINK REF="REF-Widness-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widness 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beeram-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeram 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transfusions may be given in emergencies for shock, or prior to surgery, but in critical care most transfusions are given to raise blood haemoglobin concentrations above ill-defined critical minima (<LINK REF="REF-Fetus-and--Newborn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fetus and Newborn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shannon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shannon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fetus-and-Newborn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fetus and Newborn 2002</LINK>) or &#8216;thresholds&#8217;; the latter term is used in this review. Measurements other than haemoglobin level have been advocated, such as oxygen availability (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siggaard_x002d_Andersen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siggaard-Andersen 1990</LINK>), fractional oxygen extraction (<LINK REF="REF-Wardle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardle 2001</LINK>) or the presence of clinical signs of anaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK>). Apart from the putative clinical signs, these measures are not easy to collect and have not improved prediction of outcome. Haemoglobin levels, on the other hand, are universally and quickly available. Measurements of haematocrit are generally interchangeable with haemoglobin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current recommendations advocate maintaining higher levels of haemoglobin in the early critical weeks. Clinical trials reflect this practice by comparing haemoglobin levels held apart by fixed amounts, but falling with postnatal age. While an essential outcome of trials of neonatal critical care must be survival, long term anaemia has the potential to affect both brain growth and other components of chronic disease of the premature infant (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2006</LINK>). Therefore long term developmental, growth and health outcomes must be included and combined in both short term and long term follow-up studies.</P>
<P>Transfusion borne infections are rare but continue to emerge (<LINK REF="REF-Blajchman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blajchman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stramer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stramer 2009</LINK>). Potential and unproven adverse effects may be subtle and cumulative (<LINK REF="REF-Holman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 1995</LINK>), such as retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Dani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dani 2004</LINK>), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Silvers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvers 1998</LINK>), necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Mally-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mally 2006</LINK>), suppression of host resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 2007</LINK>) or iron overload (<LINK REF="REF-Hirano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirano 2001</LINK>). Blood which has been stored, particularly if not leukoreduced, contains pro-inflammatory microparticles (<LINK REF="REF-Simak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simak 2006</LINK>), which may contribute to transfusion-related acute lung injury, multiple organ failure or infection (<LINK REF="REF-McFaul-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFaul 2009</LINK>). Transfusion borne infections are too rare to evaluate as outcomes in a clinical trial, though the number of donor exposures might be used as a proxy outcome. </P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-10 11:32:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transfusion of packed red cells raises red cell volume and the haemoglobin level of the blood. The presence of additional adult haemoglobin may double the effect of haemoglobin on oxygen delivery to the tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1984</LINK>). However, it is not clear how well or when the transfused red cells function. Stored donor red cells are deficient in 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (<LINK REF="REF-Delivoria_x002d_Papadopoulos-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delivoria-Papadopoulos 1971</LINK>) and are less able to generate S-nitrosohaemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett_x002d_Guerrero-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett-Guerrero 2007</LINK>) which assists in targeting red cell oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2006</LINK>). Some of these functions are known to recover in the recipient circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Zimrin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimrin 2009</LINK>). Transfused allogeneic red cells have shorter life spans than the recipient cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2004</LINK>), and if the rise in haemoglobin from a donor source suppresses erythropoietin in the recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Keyes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keyes 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 2001</LINK>) the haematological benefits of transfusion could be short-lived or reversed. In the face of a falling haemoglobin level, use of a low rather than a high haemoglobin threshold for transfusion may result in later rather than fewer transfusions; therefore the effects of the different strategies may reflect transfusion practices as well as haemoglobin levels.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both anaemia of prematurity and blood transfusion have their own morbidities. Clinical uncertainty about indications for transfusion is reflected in high variability in transfusion rates between treatment centres (<LINK REF="REF-Bednarek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bednarek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringer 1998</LINK>). Restrictive transfusion (at low haemoglobin thresholds) led to equivalent outcomes when compared with conventional liberal transfusion (at high thresholds) in critically ill children (<LINK REF="REF-Lacroix-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacroix 2007</LINK>) and led to improved survival in subgroups of adults (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e9_bert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hébert 1999</LINK>). A systematic review antedated the current generation of randomised evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Hume-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hume 1997</LINK>).

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 5) using the terms BLOOD TRANSFUSION and INFANT. We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2011) using exploded MeSH terms BLOOD TRANSFUSION or the free text terms BLOOD AND TRANSFUS*, RED AND CELL AND TRANSFUS* or text terms ERYTHROCYTE AND TRANSFUSION in all languages. We combined the retrieved titles (AND) with the exploded MeSH term INFANT, NEWBORN. We searched EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2011) using the terms INFANT (with either "low birth weight" or "premature") with BLOOD TRANSFUSION. We searched the Science Citation Index (September 1984 to June 2011) for trials which cited the trials identified by our searches as MEDLINE and Embase.

<P>We used a data extraction form to extract the data together. We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data, using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (WMD) where appropriate using Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We assessed each identified trial for methodological quality with respect to (a) inclusiveness of the population, (b) masking of allocation, (c) masking of intervention, (d) completeness of follow-up and (e) masking of outcome assessment. We sought clarification from at least one author of each trial considered for selection. Some unpublished data were available from the records of trials; we had access to data from the <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> study and communicated with the principal author of <LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK> et al for some details of outcomes.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-15 10:45:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed risk of bias in selection, performance, outcome and attrition. Our intention was to employ a fixed-effect model for data analysis unless there was clinical diversity in the question or statistical heterogeneity in the outcome, in which case we would use a random-effects model. We expressed all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) unless otherwise stated. All outcomes analysed as categories were binary (event or no event) and we recorded them once per participant. We recorded all primary outcomes as RRs with all randomised infants as denominator. For secondary analyses, we expressed outcomes as 'in survivors' where appropriate.</P>

<P>We replaced missing data where the outcome could be determined (for example where infants who had died between randomisation and reaching the trial intervention had been excluded from analysis). Otherwise, where data were judged missing at random (for example where a local institutional review board refused permission to collect outcome data) we used only available data. Where it was likely that data were not missing at random, we did not include the outcome in the analysis.

<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> tables. From our searches of the literature we identified 10 randomised trials that evaluated the effects of transfusion at a given haemoglobin or haematocrit trigger in very low birth weight infants compared to either a different haemoglobin threshold or the occurrence of a clinical event. We have organised all studies in this review so that restrictive interventions are treated as interventions and liberal interventions as control (reflecting conventions at the time these studies were started). We expressed RRs as restrictive/liberal risks.</P>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:42:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies qualified for inclusion. Four addressed comparison 1 (transfusion at a low haemoglobin or haematocrit level (restrictive) versus transfusion at a high haemoglobin or haematocrit level (liberal)) and one addressed comparison 2 (transfusion for clinical signs of anaemia (restrictive) versus transfusion at a set level of haemoglobin or haematocrit (liberal)).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Transfusion at a low haemoglobin or haematocrit level (restrictive) versus transfusion at a high haemoglobin or haematocrit level (liberal)</HEADING>
<P>There were four included studies addressing this comparison. For ease of comparison we have used a mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration of 340 g/l (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2008</LINK>) to convert haematocrit to haemoglobin (haematocrit % x 34 = haemoglobin g/l) and have expressed transfusion thresholds in Table 1.</P>
<P>The (Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion (PINT)) study was published in two reports<LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> , addressing outcomes by first hospital discharge and follow-up at 18 to 21 months corrected gestational age (Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion Outcome Study (PINTOS)). 451 newborn infants were enrolled from 10 neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada, the United States and Australia. Enrolled infants were less than 1000 g birth weight and 31 weeks gestational age, and less than 48 hours old at the time of enrolment. Infants could be enrolled if not transfused after six hours of age. Infants were randomly assigned to either the restrictive (low haemoglobin) threshold or the liberal (high haemoglobin) threshold for transfusion (15 ml/kg of packed red blood cells (PRBCs)). Transfusion thresholds fell with postnatal age over the first two weeks of age and were adjusted for the need for respiratory support (any positive pressure airway support or oxygen supplementation); see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The capillary haemoglobin thresholds while receiving respiratory support in the first week were 115 g/l versus 135 g/l for restrictive and liberal groups, falling to 75 g/l versus 85 g/l at 15 days and later. If the infants no longer required respiratory support, these thresholds were 100 g/l versus 120 g/l respectively, falling to 75 g/l versus 85 g/l at or after 15 days. Transfusions outside the threshold algorithm were allowed for predefined emergencies or for surgery. Detailed outcomes describing the effect of the intervention on numbers of infants transfused, numbers of transfusions given per infant, haemoglobin levels and donor exposure were reported. The primary outcome of the primary report (PINT) was a composite outcome at first hospital discharge of death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity or brain injury on ultrasound (cystic periventricular leukomalacia, intraparenchymal echodensity, porencephalic cyst or ventriculomegaly). The secondary report (PINTOS) addressed a primary composite outcome at follow-up of mortality or severe adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, severe visual or hearing impairment). Other clinical outcomes are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK> et al conducted a single centre trial in the USA enrolling 103 infants of birth weight 500 to 1300 g. Infants were enrolled as soon after birth as possible but age at enrolment varied, being delayed in infants when there was no immediate indication to transfuse by high threshold criteria. Infants were permitted to be enrolled if they had received up to two perinatal transfusions prior to enrolment. Infants in the restrictive group were transfused at haematocrits of 34%, 28% or 22% respectively if they were, intubated, receiving continuous distending pressure or additional oxygen, or breathing room air. Infants in the liberal group were transfused at haematocrits of 46%, 38%, or 30% respectively. These values are equivalent to haemoglobin levels of 116 g/l, 95 g/l and 75 g/l for the restrictive group and 156 g/l, 129 g/l and 102 g/l for the liberal group. Infants were transfused with 15 ml/kg of PRBCs. The trial ended at discharge. The primary outcome was numbers of transfusions given per infant. Other measures of the intervention were numbers of infants transfused and rates of donor exposure. Clinical outcomes included survival, adverse ultrasound findings (periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage), severe retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Other outcomes are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Partial follow-up of these infants has been recently published (McCoy 2011, Nopoulos 2011). These data are not included in this review and may be considered in future updates.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK> et al conducted a single centre trial in Taiwan of 36 infants of less than 1500 g birth weight aged up to three days of age. Infants were randomised by computer allocation. Infants in the restrictive group were transfused at haematocrits of 35%, 30% or 22% respectively if they were intubated, receiving continuous distending pressure or in room air. Infants in the liberal group were transfused at haematocrits of 45%, 40%, or 30%. These values are equivalent to haemoglobin levels of 119 g/l, 102 g/l and 75 g/l for the restrictive group and 153 g/l, 136 g/l and 102 g/l for the liberal group. Infants were transfused with 15ml/kg of PRBCs. Haematologic outcomes were measured at 30 days of age and clinical outcomes were measured at 28 days of age and at 36 weeks postconceptional age. The primary outcome was number of transfusions given per infant. Clinical outcomes included survival, intraventricular haemorrhage, severe retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Other outcomes are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We obtained further outcomes and clarification from the author, including a composite outcome of death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, or brain injury on ultrasound. Communication with the author of <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK> indicated that there was a category of mild ventriculomegaly with high prevalence counted in their data which had a good outcome and which appeared qualitatively different from the more permanent condition used to define ventriculomegaly as severe brain injury in the other trials; we therefore asked the authors to report their outcome of brain injury excluding mild ventriculomegaly.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Connelly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Connelly 1999</LINK> et al conducted a very small trial in a single Canadian centre recruiting 24 infants of less than 1500 g birth weight. The trial remains unpublished except in abstract form. Infants were randomised at birth to receive transfusions at 100 g/l versus 130 g/l for the first week. These thresholds were maintained in the second week in infants requiring more than 40% oxygen, while infants requiring less oxygen were transfused at thresholds of 90 g/l and 110 g/l. During and after the third week of life all infants were treated at threshold values of 80 g/l until discharge. Transfusions of PRBCs were given in amounts calculated to restore the haemoglobin level to 150 g/l. The primary outcome was the number of transfusions received per infant. Other outcomes describing the effect of the intervention on haemoglobin levels and donor exposure were reported. A composite outcome of death or survival with major disability (adverse ultrasound findings (periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular haemorrhage), severe retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) was reported. Other clinical outcomes are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Transfusion for clinical signs of anaemia (restrictive) versus transfusion at a set level of haemoglobin or haematocrit (liberal)</HEADING>
<P>There was one study addressing this comparison.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK> et al studied 56 infants in a single centre in the USA. They compared a transfusion strategy for clinical signs alone (referred to in this review as 'restrictive') with a strategy of transfusing for a haemoglobin threshold of 100 g/l (referred to in this review as 'liberal') "regardless of their clinical status". The clinical signs used for transfusing infants were: a requirement for a preoperative surgery haemoglobin level of 100 g/l or greater; tachycardia greater than 170 beats per minute for four days without primary cardiac abnormality; no weight gain for seven days with caloric intake of more than 140 kcal/kg/day and clinically notable apnoea not responsive to theophylline therapy. It is implied from the designation of the restrictive group as the 'non-transfusion group' that clinical signs of anaemia would only be thus interpreted in the presence of a haemoglobin level of less than 100 g/l. Transfusions were permitted for all infants for replacement of blood loss, exchange transfusion or pulmonary haemorrhage. This haemoglobin threshold and these clinical indications were selected "to assess the benefits of 'booster' transfusions in formerly sick premature infants". Infants of less than 1500 g were enrolled, apparently from soon after birth, and the study was ended when infants reached 1600 g weight. No sample size calculation or statement of primary outcome was made. The outcomes reported were weight gain, infants with apnoea, cost of hospitalisation and a number of hematological outcomes. This was a much earlier study and the infants in this study are likely larger and more stable than in the later three included studies (above).</P>

Infants were randomised to receive transfusions if FOE equalled or exceeded 0.47 or "if significant clinical concern" was expressed by clinicians. The primary hypothesis was that infants assessed for the need for transfusion by repeated FOE measurements would receive fewer transfusions than those assessed in the conventional way using haemoglobin. Infants were excluded if they required ventilation, and due to this selection, we excluded this study from this analysis.</P>

<P>None of the trials included could blind clinical caregivers to the allocation of infants. There is some evidence of co-intervention in the <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> trial as more transfusions (16% versus 7% of transfusions given, P &lt; 0.01) were given by 'clinical decision' (i.e. transfusions permitted in addition to the transfusion algorithm). These were not protocol violations as the protocol specified that transfusions could be given for surgery and acute hypotension. These transfusions may also be considered outcomes, as the excess transfusions were given predominantly for bleeding, surgery and sepsis/shock. <LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK> also reported a difference in transfusions given in addition to the study thresholds, again more often in the restrictive group (13% versus 1% of transfusions given, P &lt; 0.001). A further 3% of transfusions were not given according to protocol in the liberal group; all protocol transfusions were given to the restrictive group. In <LINK REF="STD-Connelly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Connelly 1999</LINK> there were seven protocol violations (all resulting in transfusion above threshold levels) among the 65 transfusions given, but only two of these instances were recorded among the 25 transfusions given in the first two weeks of life, the period in which the two interventions were different. As both violations were in the high level group the separation was maintained. In <LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK> the decision to transfuse the restrictive group depended on unblinded clinical observation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK> reports nine different measures of apnoea, some taken from bedside nursing reports. In an environment where the unblinded intervention is administered by personnel selecting the events recorded as apnoea, there is opportunity for observer bias. We have therefore selected the outcome 'apnoea receiving methylxanthine treatment' as a measure requiring intervention and therefore more likely protected from bias.</P>
<P>Outcome data recorded at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK>) or from ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Connelly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Connelly 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2009</LINK>) evaluations were collected by observers blind to the intervention.</P>
<P>Overall, some evidence of co-intervention can be attributed to the lack of blinding of the intervention, and this has generally acted to reduce the difference in haemoglobin levels obtained by the two strategies.</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK>) compared using clinical signs alone to transfusion at a haemoglobin threshold, which could also be considered restrictive versus liberal practice.

<P>Unless otherwise stated, all RRs are reported as ratios of risks in the restrictive (low threshold) group to those in the liberal (high threshold) group.

<P>The analysis is predominantly influenced by the larger <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>These trials have in common the comparison of the use of low versus high haemoglobin thresholds for transfusion. However, there are sufficient differences in the thresholds used, the indications for transfusion, and in the transfusion targets sought to consider these trials clinically as well as methodologically diverse. Taken together, they make a similar type of comparison but their estimates of outcome may be expected to differ. Many of the analyses showed statistical heterogeneity. Therefore the analyses were conducted using a random-effects rather than a fixed-effect model. As the differences in transfusion intervention resulted in different haematological outcomes, we have reported these first as they report the success of the interventions in achieving separation between the two arms of the trials. We also reported two clinical outcomes which were not predefined in the selection criteria, patent ductus arteriosus and necrotising enterocolitis, as their clinical importance has become apparent during the preparation of this review.</P>

All of these components reported increased risks in the restrictive group which did not reach statistical significance. Cognitive delay was measured as the MDI of the Bayley score of &lt; 70, which is two standard deviations below the mean. This outcome alone was analysed in the original report as an odds ratio (OR), adjusted for gestational age and study site. This analysis for cognitive delay reached borderline statistical significance favouring the liberal strategy (adjusted OR 1.74; 95% CI 0.98 to 3.11).

The numbers of transfusions given with restrictive versus liberal strategies is not reported. However, there is graphical information which indicates that large differences in transfusion volumes resulted from the interventions; for example at six weeks postnatal age the percentage of haemoglobin A (most likely almost entirely from transfused blood) in the restrictive group was 58% compared with 89% in the liberal group. The only clinical indication used for transfusing the four infants transfused in the restrictive group was apnoea.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trials comparing restrictive versus liberal haemoglobin thresholds</HEADING>
<P>Four randomised trials were identified (the smallest unpublished) which compared the effects of giving blood transfusions to very low birth weight infants at low (restrictive) versus high (liberal) haemoglobin or haematocrit thresholds. Of 614 patients randomised, 73% were enrolled in the <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> trial. The trials differed in the birth weights of the patients enrolled and in the transfusion thresholds used. The restrictive thresholds used were similar, but the limits used for the liberal thresholds varied, as did the transfusion targets (see table in <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>)<I>.</I> The four trials have in common the exploration of the effects of using a transfusion threshold lower than conventional, and it is reasonable to compare their outcomes. The trials compare the effects of different thresholds used for maintenance or 'top-up' transfusions and not indications used for emergency transfusion. Overall, a restrictive practice produced very little reduction of the numbers of babies receiving at least one transfusion (typical RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) but the effect varied greatly between studies, being greatest where the transfusion was made to a haemoglobin goal rather than as a set volume. The differences in mean haemoglobin levels resulting from the strategy were considerably smaller than the levels used as transfusion thresholds and were sometimes undetectable.</P>
<P>Restrictive versus liberal transfusion policy within the specific thresholds chosen had little effect on mortality at first hospital discharge (typical RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.76) or on the composite outcome, reported from two trials, of death or severe morbidity at discharge (typical RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.20). Three trials reported a composite outcome of death or brain injury which gave a typical RR of 1.12; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.55.</P>
<P>One follow-up study was conducted at 18 months corrected age in the <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> study. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.47) or in the components of this composite outcome (death, cognitive delay, severe visual impairment or severe hearing impairment), but the confidence limits were large; significant risk attributable in particular to the use of low haemoglobin thresholds cannot be ruled out. The criterion for cognitive delay was a score of &lt; 70 on the Bayley mental developmental index (MDI). Using a less severe definition (MDI &lt; 85) gave a typical RR for the composite primary outcome of 1.21 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.44) favouring the liberal strategy. The argument for using this interpretation for the primary outcome is more clearly made in the original report, in which the analysis was adjusted for site and gestational age.</P>
<P>Specific disorders which have been thought to be related to transfusion policy have included necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. No effect on these outcomes was attributable to restrictive or liberal policy. Within the limits of the transfusion strategies compared, and the differences in haemoglobin levels obtained, there was no reduction of weight gain attributable to a restrictive policy. The numbers of infants who required treatment for apnoea were not different between the strategies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Transfusion for clinical signs only versus for transfusion at haemoglobin threshold</HEADING>
<P>The single randomised trial of <LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK> compared the restrictive practice of waiting for symptoms attributable to anaemia to appear prior to transfusing versus the then current liberal practice of transfusing at a fixed level of haemoglobin (100 g/l). These infants were larger and healthier (there were no deaths) than those reviewed in the previous comparison. The effect of these practices on transfusion frequency was not documented, but the large differences in haemoglobin A levels, and a persistent difference of 26 g/l in haemoglobin seen at discharge from the study suggests very large differences in transfusion volumes received. The incidence of apnoea was high and no difference was found between groups (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.43). This study, though underpowered, contributes to our understanding that rate of weight gain and incidence of apnoea are not outcomes affected by transfusion strategy.</P>

<P>There is no clear benefit or risk attributable to the use of low versus high haemoglobin transfusion thresholds in very low birth weight infants at 18 months follow-up, but this conclusion is derived from a single trial powered for short term outcomes, and the possibility of undetected significant clinical effects cannot be ignored. For outcomes reported at hospital discharge, the conclusion of no benefit or risk from two trials is made with more confidence (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20). These uncertainties, combined with observations from post hoc analyses suggesting poorer outcomes in neurodevelopment <LINK REF="STD-PINT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PINT 2006</LINK> and at hospital discharge <LINK REF="STD-Bell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2005</LINK>, make it difficult to reject a conclusion that the use of a high threshold may be beneficial. It can be said with more certainty that there is no justification for allowing haemoglobin transfusion thresholds to fall below the lower limits used in these studies. The single trial by <LINK REF="STD-Blank-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Blank 1984</LINK> comparing transfusion for clinical signs only versus transfusion at a fixed haemoglobin level of 100 g/l is similarly inconclusive, as it is not possible to assess the completeness of the data or the numbers of infants lost to the analysis. There is no evidence from any trial in this review to support the association of transfusion strategies with apnoea, rate of weight gain or necrotising enterocolitis.</P>

An earlier systematic (non-Cochrane) review (<LINK REF="REF-Hume-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hume 1997</LINK>) reviewed the literature up to 1996, which concluded that stable asymptomatic infants with haemoglobin levels greater than 7.0 g/l did not require red blood cell transfusions, which is in agreement in part with the conclusions of this review. Trials in which the haemoglobin has been increased with erythropoietin versus placebo, with restrictive transfusion thresholds similar to those described in this review have not shown differences in major outcomes and therefore appear to confirm the general findings of this review with respect to the safety of the lower limits for haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Shannon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shannon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2001</LINK>). Claims of uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1984a</LINK>) which attributed poor weight gain to low haemoglobin levels in excess of the lower limits reviewed here have not been substantiated. The finding in this review that restrictive therapy has no effect on numbers of infants requiring treatment with apnoea is contrary to uncontrolled observations of individual apnoea frequency responding to transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Joshi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasidharan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasidharan 1992</LINK>); these effects are thought to be attributable to volume expansion and not specifically to blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Bifano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bifano 1992</LINK>). The overall conclusion that restrictive therapy does not affect survival is consistent with the findings of very similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in children in paediatric intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Lacroix-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacroix 2007</LINK>) and in adult intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e9_bert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hébert 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>The use of restrictive as compared to liberal haemoglobin transfusion thresholds in infants of very low birth weight results in modest reductions in exposure to transfusion and in haemoglobin levels. There is no evidence that using a lower haemoglobin transfusion threshold (using the limits tested in these trials) has an effect on mortality, major morbidities or on survival without major morbidity in very low birth weight infants. As the restrictive levels used were more similar among trials, a summarised approximation of the lower thresholds evaluated is presented in Table 2. Safety at haemoglobin levels below these lower limits has not been evaluated and these should be maintained until further evidence is available. As the trials differed greatly in high threshold values, we have not attempted such an approximation for the higher levels.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-21 13:47:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The safe lower limits for haemoglobin transfusion thresholds remain undefined, and there is still uncertainty regarding the benefits of maintaining a higher level. These uncertainties affect decisions based on maintaining haemoglobin targets however these are achieved, be it by transfusion, erythropoietin therapy, placental transfusion or restrictions on blood sampling, although there are functional differences in the performance of haemoglobin to address when these interventions are compared. There are sufficiently provocative findings from reported secondary outcomes to justify a further larger clinical trial with primary outcomes which address the issues identified as secondary in these trials. Studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of strategies for maintaining haemoglobin levels in very low birth weight infants would also be helpful.</P>

<P>In this randomised trial near infrared spectroscopy was used to determine peripheral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE). Infants were randomised to receive transfusions if FOE fell below 0.47 or "if significant clinical concern" was expressed by clinicians. The primary hypothesis was that infants assessed for the need for transfusion by repeated FOE measurements would receive fewer transfusions than those assessed in the conventional way using haemoglobin. Infants were excluded if they required ventilation, and this selection led to the exclusion of this study from this analysis. This was essentially a feasibility study</P>

<P>Caregivers could not be blinded to allocation or the intervention. Clinical outcomes, especially of apneic events not requiring treatment, susceptible to bias. There was an excess of transfusions given in addition to the study thresholds, more often in the restrictive group (12.7% versus 0.8% of transfusions given in restrictive versus liberal groups ) these were co-interventions rather than protocol violations, as transfusions were permitted in this trial, notably for severe apnoea and congestive cardiac failure). In addition, 3% of transfusions prescribed by study protocol in the liberal group were not given; all prescribed transfusions were given to the restrictive group. Additional transfusions could represent an outcome, such as an increased tendency for bleeding, surgery or sepsis resulting from allocation to the restrictive group. Ultrasound evaluations were by blinded assessment</P>

<P>Caregivers could not be blinded to allocation or the intervention. Clinical outcomes, especially of apneic events not requiring treatment, susceptible to bias. There were 7 protocol violations (all resulting from transfusion before and therefore above the threshold levels) among the 65 transfusions given, but only 2 of these instances were recorded among the 25 transfusions given in the first two weeks of life, the period over which the two different regimes were compared; both of these involved transfusion at higher than prescribed levels, but as both were in the high level group the separation was maintained</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Caregivers could not be blinded to the intervention. There is evidence of co-intervention (performance bias) in that the mean numbers of transfusions per infant given for 'clinical reasons' i.e. in addition to the transfusion threshold, was 0.8, standard deviation (SD 2.0) in the restrictive group and 0.4 (SD 1.3) in the liberal group. (P = 0.007). This accounts for 16% of the transfusions given to the restrictive group and 7% of those given to the liberal group (P &lt; 001). Transfusions given for clinical reasons were permitted and were therefore co-interventions rather than violations. Some additional transfusions could represent an outcome, such as an increased tendency for bleeding, surgery or sepsis resulting from allocation to the restrictive group</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>No data appear to be missing, but infants who died very early in the study were reported but excluded from analysis. These have been reintroduced in this analysis. A subset of 39 of the 103 infants enrolled were selected as (a) remaining in hospital and (b) suitable for physiologic measurements (either intubated or in room air, information from author) performed before the first transfusion given after the age of 6 weeks. These studies were haemoglobin, haematocrit, reticulocyte count, oxygen saturation, cardiac output (by echocardiography, and not measured if a significant shunt was present)), blood lactic acid, plasma erythropoietin and serum ferritin. The selection of infants and the timing of sampling could each have been affected by the study intervention and therefore could not be represented as randomly available. These data were therefore excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>Ultrasound examinations were performed at 7 days of age in all infants and at 14 and 42 days of age in infants who were born at &lt; 27 weeks&#8217; gestation or who had an abnormal cranial ultrasound examination at 7 days of age. All surviving 97 subjects had day 7 ultrasound examinations and 52 (28 restrictive; 24 liberal) had day 42 examinations. Therefore it is assumed that the 45 infants who were both &#8807; 27 weeks gestation and had normal 7 day ultrasounds would have had normal ultrasounds at day 42 if examined</P>
