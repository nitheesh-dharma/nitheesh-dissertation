<P>Six more RCTs identified and added in the 2011 update. Primary outcome list has been restructured to include bowel and sexual activities. This is to reflect the fact that more recent studies report additional outcomes. The number of primary outcomes has been reduced and comparisons structured to assess outcomes within 2 years post-surgery and greater than 2 years post-surgery, rather than at multiple time points, to simplify the comparisons.</P>

<P>When hysterectomy is required for non-cancerous conditions, either the uterus alone (subtotal hysterectomy) or the uterus and the cervix (total hysterectomy) are removed. It has been suggested that not removing the cervix (subtotal hysterectomy) would reduce the chances of sexual difficulties or problems with passing urine or stools. This review has found no evidence of a difference between these two different operations for these outcomes. Surgery is faster with subtotal hysterectomy and there is less blood loss during or just after surgery, although these benefits are not large. With subtotal hysterectomy, women are less likely to experience fever during or just after surgery but are more likely to have long term ongoing menstrual bleeding when compared with total hysterectomy.</P>

<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of multiple outcomes that assessed urinary, bowel or sexual function between TH and STH, either in the short term (up to two years post-surgery) or long term (nine years post-surgery). Length of operation (difference of 11 min) and amount of blood lost during surgery (difference of 57 ml) were significantly reduced during subtotal hysterectomy when compared with total hysterectomy. These differences are unlikely to constitute a clinical benefit and there was no evidence of a difference in the odds of blood transfusion. Post-operative fever and urinary retention were less likely (fever: OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8; retention: OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.8) and ongoing cyclical vaginal bleeding up to two years after surgery was more likely (OR 16.0, 95% CI 6.1 to 41.6) after STH compared with TH. There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of other complications, recovery from surgery, alleviation of pre-surgery symptoms or readmission rates between the two types of hysterectomy carried out through the abdominal or laparoscopic route, although trials comparing the laparoscopic route were underpowered to detect some differences.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-02 19:18:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anatomically, the uterus consists of two parts, the uterine body and the cervix. Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. It is the most frequently performed major surgical intervention in gynaecology. A total hysterectomy involves the removal of both the uterine body and the cervix; a subtotal hysterectomy involves the removal of only the uterine body, leaving the cervix intact. Subtotal hysterectomy is also referred to as supracervical hysterectomy.</P>
<P>The first reported elective hysterectomy was performed through a vaginal approach by Conrad Langenbeck in 1813. The first elective abdominal hysterectomy, a subtotal operation, was performed by Charles Clay of Manchester in 1863 (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1997</LINK>). Subtotal abdominal hysterectomy remained the operation of choice until 1929, when EH Richardson performed the first total abdominal hysterectomy. Subsequent concerns over the potential for the development of cancer in a conserved cervix, combined with improvements in operative and anaesthetic techniques, meant that total hysterectomy almost completely replaced subtotal hysterectomy.</P>
<P>One of the few indications for subtotal hysterectomy was recto-vaginal endometriosis, which would have made removal of the cervix difficult or hazardous. However, consistent with developments in endometriosis surgery, it is now believed that retaining the cervix is likely to lead to residual disease and future symptoms. Therefore, subtotal hysterectomy should be seen as a relative contraindication for this type of endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nezhat-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nezhat 1996</LINK>). The other arguments presented in favour of subtotal hysterectomy include retaining the supporting structures of the uterus and vagina (cardinal and uterosacral ligaments) thereby in the long term reducing the risk of prolapse after a hysterectomy. In addition, by causing less damage to the nerves supplying the vagina, bladder and bowel, it is possible that subtotal hysterectomy might cause fewer urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms. A recent increase in the use of the laparoscopic approach to performing hysterectomies has led to an increase in numbers of subtotal procedures as well, as they would appear to be easier to perform than total hysterectomies. These proposed benefits of subtotal hysterectomy need to be reviewed and compared to outcomes with the standard procedure of total hysterectomy. </P>
<P>On the other hand, concern is often expressed regarding the risk of developing stump carcinoma of the cervix after performing subtotal hysterectomy. This has not been substantiated. The risk of cervical stump carcinoma in women with a previously normal Pap smear is no more than 0.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Storm-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storm 1992</LINK>), approximately the same risk as for vaginal carcinoma after hysterectomy for a benign condition (<LINK REF="STD-Lyons-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lyons 1993</LINK>). However, caution should be taken so that women with subtotal hysterectomy fully understand the need for complying with the existing cervical screening program and they are not inappropriately excluded from screening.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-13 13:37:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparative rates of subtotal and total hysterectomy vary in different parts of the world. There has been some evidence of a resurgence in the use of subtotal hysterectomy, particularly in Scandinavia. In Sweden, the ratio of subtotal to total hysterectomy is 0.56 (<LINK REF="REF-Culhed-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culhed 1993</LINK>) and in Denmark, the number of total abdominal hysterectomies decreased by 38% and the number of subtotal hysterectomies increased by 458% during the years 1988 to 1998, by which time 22% of all hysterectomies were subtotal (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 2001</LINK>). There has been a smaller rise in the proportion of subtotal hysterectomies performed in the United States from 0.7% in 1990 to 1.1% in 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 2002</LINK>) and subsequently to 1.6% in 1997 and 7.5% in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Merrill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merrill 2008</LINK>). Changes were more pronounced in California where the rate was 6.9% in 1994 and rose to 20.8% in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2006</LINK>). In contrast, the rate in the United Kingdom remains very low with a ratio of only 0.04 (<LINK REF="REF-Gimbel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimbel 2005</LINK>), although a UK survey suggests that the ratio of subtotal to total hysterectomy will increase in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Esdaile-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esdaile 2006</LINK>). Given the wide global variation in rates, there is uncertainty about the potential advantages and disadvantages of subtotal hysterectomy when compared to a total procedure and a review is required to clarify the uncertainty.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-03-02 19:38:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After the publication of the protocol, the review authors decided to list outcomes according to their status as primary or secondary outcomes. In the 2011 update of the review, the outcomes were re-ordered and some new outcomes added. In the original review, outcomes were analysed at the time points six months, 12 months and 24 months, as described in the included studies. In the 'Implications for research' section of this review, the authors advised that longer term follow up was needed for full assessment of the comparative safety of subtotal versus total hysterectomy. In the 2011 update studies with longer term follow up (&gt; five years post-surgery) were also considered eligible for the review. In order to avoid analysing too many outcomes in this update of the review, we have simplified the multiple follow-up times and defined 'short term' as outcomes occurring up to and including two years after surgery and 'long term' as outcomes occurring at longer follow-up times.</P>
<P>For some of the short term measures, for example, blood loss, hospital stay and operating times, it is clinically relevant to assume that the outcome measures would be different when performed by the laparoscopic route as compared to the open approach. Also, compared to the original review, the more recent clinical trials are based on surgery by the laparoscopic route. Therefore, we have stratified the analysis under each outcome measure (both long term and short term) by the route of surgery, open or laparoscopic, where possible and wherever clinically relevant.</P>
<P>Studies were only included if they assessed one or more of the primary outcomes.</P>

<P>Risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors (AL and AM) during the 2011 review, using the risk of bias tool developed by Julian Higgins (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following domains of the risk of bias tool were assessed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generation (whether the allocation sequence was adequately generated, for example, random number table, computer random number generator, coin tossing, throwing dice);</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment (whether the allocation was adequately concealed, for example, sequentially numbered containers of identical appearance, central allocation, sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes);</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (whether knowledge of the allocated intervention was adequately prevented during the study, for example, by ensuring blinding of participants and key personnel or, where there is no blinding, knowledge of the intervention is not likely to influence the outcomes);</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data (whether incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed, for example, missing data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, proportion of missing outcomes not sufficient to affect estimates, reasons for missing data unlikely to be related to the outcomes);</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting (whether the reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting, for example, previous publication of a study protocol, other evidence that the study contains all of the prespecified outcomes);</LI>
<LI>other sources of bias (whether the study was apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias, for example, baseline imbalance, bias related to study design, early termination of the study).</LI>

<P>Dichotomous data were expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Where ordinal data were used to measure outcomes, for example, satisfaction rates, the categories were collapsed and the data dichotomised. The distributions of continuous data from the included studies were inspected for evidence of skew according to guidance from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. If means and standard deviations (SDs) were available, or could be calculated, continuous data were expressed as the mean difference between groups with 95% confidence interval.

<P>The included studies were carefully inspected for evidence of clinical heterogeneity, in either the characteristics of the participants, the interventions, the outcomes or the trial duration. Where pooling the studies was appropriate, statistical heterogeneity between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points on the graphs and the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking the results of the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test, using a P value of less than 0.10 as evidence of significant heterogeneity. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was also checked to determine the percentage of total variation across studies that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). These values can be categorised as follows: an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 25% represents mild heterogeneity, 50% represents moderate heterogeneity and 75% or more is evidence of extreme heterogeneity. In cases with extreme statistical heterogeneity which could not be explained by differences between studies, the estimates were not pooled in the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>We identified 10 trials that were potentially relevant to the original publication of the review.

<P>For the 2011 update, nine trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The nine trials randomised a total of 1553 women, but not all participants were included in the analysis of every outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design</HEADING>
<P>All trials were randomised parallel group studies. Five trials were undertaken in a single centre, one trial involved 11 different centres in Denmark, one trial involved eight different centres in Sweden, one trial had four different centres in the US and one trial had two different centres in the UK. Two trials were undertaken in North America, two in Italy, two in Sweden, one in Denmark, one in Iran, and one in the UK. Power calculations for sample size were reported for seven of the included studies and were appropriate (although one study was concluded prematurely because of difficulties in recruitment); for the other two trials it was not clear whether power calculations were undertaken.</P>
<P>Six studies claimed that analysis of outcomes was by intention to treat. One study had true intention to treat for the primary outcomes but minimal loss to follow up for secondary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Learman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Learman 2003</LINK>). Another study performed four analyses: 'regular' intention to treat (based on outcome data only for those participants whose results were known, that is, excluding exclusions from the analysis and those lost to follow-up); 'best case scenario' intention to treat (the analysis considered all randomised participants and estimated dropouts as not having the primary undesirable outcome of interest); 'worst case scenario' intention to treat (the analysis considered all randomised participants and estimated dropouts as having the primary undesirable outcome of interest); and 'carry forward' intention to treat (analysis considered the last registered information on the outcome of interest among those dropping out as being the result at the end of the study period). Conclusions were based on the 'regular' intention to treat analysis, which excluded 13.2% of participants after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morelli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morelli 2007</LINK>) assessed peri-operative outcomes, but not other outcomes, in full intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Dropouts and withdrawals, where reported, were similar between randomised groups but analysis of the primary outcomes was only undertaken where data were available. Two other studies claiming ITT analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Ellstrom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ellstrom 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2010</LINK>) had exclusions from all analyses that were similar between randomised groups. Two studies did not have any ITT analyses and for one other study ITT analysis was not reported. There was no evidence that funding of the trials was from groups that could have benefited from the results of the studies; seven trials reported the source of their funding and two did not report how funding was provided. Follow up after surgery ranged from six to seven months (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asnafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Asnafi 2010</LINK>), one year (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorlero-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gorlero 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellstrom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ellstrom 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2010</LINK>), two years (<LINK REF="STD-Learman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Learman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morelli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morelli 2007</LINK>) to seven to 11 years (mean nine years) (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>).</P>

The mean age of the women in the trials varied from 42 to 49 years, although one study undertook longer follow up (an average of nine years after surgery). All women were eligible for hysterectomy for benign conditions, mostly fibroids or heavy menstrual bleeding. Women were excluded if they had known or suspected malignant conditions or other pathology. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorlero-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gorlero 2008</LINK>) excluded women with known endometriosis.</P>

Two of the studies using the abdominal route specified that the total hysterectomy be done by the clamp-cut-ligate method (<LINK REF="REF-Kaser-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaser 1985</LINK>) with polyglycolic sutures and antibiotic prophylaxis, and that the endocervical canal be electrocoagulated (surgical coagulation of tissue by an electrical heat process) after removing the uterus in subtotal hysterectomy. No other detailed instructions were provided and the remaining studies allowed surgeons to perform the operations using their customary techniques. Seven trials did not include any information on the experience or number of surgeons performing the procedures, one trial stated that only experienced surgeons were used (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>) and one other trial stated that all the laparoscopic operations were performed by one experienced surgeon who was a consultant (<LINK REF="STD-Gorlero-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gorlero 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>In one trial, the primary outcomes were various measures of peri-operative morbidity and sexual function at one and two years (<LINK REF="STD-Learman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Learman 2003</LINK>), another trial assessed the effects of surgery on a wide range of urinary tract symptoms at one year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Gimbel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gimbel 2003</LINK>), another assessed psychological wellbeing and sexual function together with clinical outcomes at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2010</LINK>), and another evaluated measures of bladder, bowel and sexual function in detail both at one year and at an average of nine years follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>). For two other trials, the primary outcomes were satisfaction, sexual activity, body image and health status at one year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Gorlero-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gorlero 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellstrom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ellstrom 2010</LINK>), another assessed psychosocial functioning (defined as sexual, pain and psychological outcomes) at six months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2006</LINK>), another assessed sexual function as well as clinical outcomes at six months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Asnafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Asnafi 2010</LINK>), and the remaining trial measured a wide range of outcomes, pelvic and urinary symptoms, surgical complications and clinical outcome, at two years follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Morelli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morelli 2007</LINK>).</P>

Substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 71%) was found in the analysis of dyspareunia within two years between the abdominal subtotal and total hysterectomy. The differences were likely to have arisen from different ways of measuring dyspareunia in the two trials. Two studies that couldn't be included in the meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Flory-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Flory 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asnafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Asnafi 2010</LINK>) also confirmed that there were no significant differences between groups. One of these studies used a laparoscopic approach to surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life was measured by five trials where women underwent abdominal surgery and one trial where women had laparoscopy. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in any of the quality of life scales measured within two years of surgery, although only a few studies contributed data to each outcome (General health (high better): MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.97, 3 studies; Physical domain (high better): MD -0.52, 95% CI -21.8 to 1.14, 3 studies; Mental domain (high better): MD -0.61, 95% CI -2.05 to 0.82, 4 studies; General health (low better): MD -1.0, 95% CI -4.92 to 2.92; 1 study; Anxiety (low better): MD 0.20, 95% CI -2.68 to 3.08, 1 study; Depression (low better): MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.55 to 1.00, 2 studies; Psychological domain (low better): MD -2.00, 95% CI -15.66 to 11.66, 1 study).</P>
<P>The data from the study that assessed quality of life outcomes at a mean of nine years after surgery were not suitable for pooling; this study also reported no significant differences between groups on any quality of life scales measured (Short Form-36: Physical functioning, Mental Health and General Health and General Health Questionnaire: somatic and anxiety symptoms) (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Operation time and recovery</HEADING>
<P>The length of time required for surgery was significantly shorter for subtotal abdominal hysterectomy when compared with total abdominal hysterectomy in four trials (MD -11.26 mins, 95% CI -15.1 to -7.5) (<LINK REF="STD-Thakar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thakar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Learman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Learman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorlero-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gorlero 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2010</LINK>), but there was no evidence of a significant difference between the laparoscopic subtotal or total hysterectomy (MD -5.0, 95% CI -14.8 to 4.8, 1 study). There was no evidence of significant differences between types of hysterectomy for hospital stay or time to resume normal activities (hospital stay - abdominal hysterectomy: MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.04, 5 studies; hospital stay - laparoscopic hysterectomy: MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.2, 1 study; normal activities - abdominal hysterectomy: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.25).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The rationale for undertaking this review was to examine the perception by women and some gynaecologists and health professionals that the retention of the cervix was necessary to maintain sexual pleasure and that total hysterectomy may lead to damage of the pelvic nerves or pelvic support structures that potentially could increase the risk of urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction and reduce sexual pleasure (<LINK REF="REF-Thakar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thakar 2005</LINK>). These were therefore considered the primary outcome measures.</P>
<P>This review has not demonstrated confirmatory evidence of subtotal hysterectomy causing less damage to neuroanatomical structures than total hysterectomy. The outcomes most indicative of such damage, including urinary, bowel and sexual dysfunction, have shown no consistent evidence of a benefit in women undergoing subtotal hysterectomy. Use of a laparoscopic or abdominal approach to hysterectomy did not alter the findings, although some of these analyses were underpowered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life measures after surgery did not appear to vary according to type of hysterectomy, whether an abdominal or laparoscopic approach was used, and up to nine years after surgery was completed. In all studies, quality of life improved significantly from baseline regardless of type of hysterectomy. This benefit of hysterectomy has been reported in another Cochrane systematic review evaluating the effect of hysterectomy for benign disease on women's well being (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A significant benefit of subtotal, as compared to total, abdominal hysterectomy was reduced operating time and reduced blood loss, although no differences were reported in the requirement for blood transfusion. These benefits were not found for the laparoscopic approach possibly because only one trial contributed data. The average difference in operation time of 12 minutes was statistically different between groups but these differences are unlikely to be clinically significant benefits. There was no evidence of any difference in recovery from surgery, either hospital stay or return to normal activities after surgery.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-02 23:20:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings in this review are based on only nine randomised trials including 1553 women. A wide range of outcomes relating to urinary, bowel and sexual function have been studied comprehensively in some of the trials included in this review. However, in order to provide a focus to the review and to improve readability, we restricted the potential major outcomes. Nevertheless, inclusion of studies comparing both open and laparoscopic routes, as well as assessing both short term and long term outcomes, have improved the scope for external validity and generalisation of study results.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-02 23:21:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review are mostly small, and with some methodological flaws. Many of the studies were underpowered to find differences, which is reflected in the wide confidence intervals in the findings. In particular, lack of blinding means we cannot exclude the likelihood that some outcomes may have been influenced by knowledge of the treatment. However, it is almost impossible to guarantee blinding in the comparison of a subtotal with total hysterectomy, because of the need for women with an intact cervix to continue screening for cervical cancer.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-03-02 23:24:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the included studies assessed a multiplicity of outcomes, often correlated, relating to urinary, bowel and sexual function, and measured at a number of different time points without adjustment or correction. The risks of multiplicity of data and clinical heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the types of symptoms, time of reporting of symptoms, scales used to analyse the symptoms and route of surgery have been addressed by stratified analysis and avoiding inclusion of too many outcome measures. In general, a reporting bias could occur when combining outcome measures reported at various time points in the individual studies under a somewhat broad and arbitrary categorisation of less than two years and greater than two years. This is especially relevant for some of the time-related short term outcomes such as urinary symptoms, which potentially could have shown improvement or deterioration over time when measured at intervals like six months, 12 months or 24 months. While combining them all under the less than two years category, we have chosen the time point with the greatest interval since surgery to represent effects persisting after recovery from surgery; and a separate long term analysis more than two years after surgery for some outcomes where longer term information was provided. As mentioned above, this allowed us to reduce the bias due to multiplicity of variables. It will always be recommended to refer to the individual studies for detailed descriptions.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-13 14:46:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four retrospective observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roovers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roovers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neumann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 2004</LINK>) and three systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; Gimbel 2007; Robert 2008) have also assessed the effects of type of hysterectomy on various measures of urinary function after surgery. Results were inconsistent in the observational studies and two of the three systematic reviews confirmed most of the results of the RCTs in this review. There was no evidence of a difference in stress incontinence according to type of hysterectomy. Although two of the three systematic reviews in broad terms confirmed the results of this review, their authors reached slightly different conclusions. The Brown systematic review did suggest that, for women aged more than 60 years, urinary incontinence after hysterectomy is about 60% higher than for women in the same age group who had not undergone hysterectomy. This has not been confirmed by other studies, in particular the RCTs in this review which measured incontinence at baseline and post-surgery and found improved urinary function. It is possible that the conditions that may lead to hysterectomy adversely affect lower urinary tract function and surgery provides a benefit. The outcomes measured here were measures of women's perception of urinary symptoms rather than urodynamic investigation since the association between clinical symptoms and urodynamic findings is poor (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 1983</LINK>). The Robert systematic review suggested that although there was no evidence of statistical differences, their meta-analysis showed a non-significant trend toward increased risk of stress incontinence (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.94, 1.78) and incomplete emptying (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.38) in women who underwent a subtotal compared with total hysterectomy. They suggested that the included trials may have been underpowered to detect effects and that longer follow up was needed to allow symptoms to emerge. However, this present review has included additional data with much longer follow up (average of nine years), published since the Robert meta analysis, which indicates similar rates of stress incontinence and incomplete emptying regardless of whether subtotal or total hysterectomy was performed. The systematic review by Gimbel concluded that overall incontinence was less likely for women undergoing total hysterectomy. However, the Gimbel review included a trial which was excluded by this review and groups were not comparable at baseline; in this trial, 64% of those undergoing subtotal hysterectomy had stress incontinence prior to surgery compared to only 18% of women in the total hysterectomy group. Moreover, Gimbel assessed prevalence of total incontinence by pooling different types of incontinence, stress, urge and mixed. This approach is not appropriate as stress and urge incontinence are considered to develop from different causes.</P>
<P>Few studies have assessed bowel function according to type of hysterectomy surgery. One retrospective study not included in the review has reported an increased prevalence of disturbed bowel function within one month of hysterectomy that waned over time but no differences according to type of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-van-Dam-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dam 1997</LINK>). In a prospective multicentre study (<LINK REF="REF-Roovers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roovers 2007</LINK>), defecation complaints such as constipation and incomplete evacuation were more prevalent in women undergoing subtotal hysterectomy when compared to women undergoing total hysterectomy.</P>
<P>Sexual response after hysterectomy has been extensively studied in a number of observational studies but results were inconsistent and some of the studies had methodological flaws (<LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roovers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roovers 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roussis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roussis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lonnee_x002d_Hoffmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonnee-Hoffmann 2006</LINK>). The poorer quality retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilkku-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkku 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saini 2002</LINK>) reported that women undergoing subtotal hysterectomy reported better sexual function and satisfaction than those undergoing total hysterectomy, but two more recent better quality prospective studies and one retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Roovers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roovers 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roussis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roussis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lonnee_x002d_Hoffmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonnee-Hoffmann 2006</LINK>) reported no differences between groups. These latter three studies also reported that perceived sexual function appeared to improve after hysterectomy regardless of technique.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-02 23:35:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be a limited resurgence in rates of subtotal hysterectomy in the Western world. This review, however, has not confirmed the perception that subtotal hysterectomy offers improved outcomes for urinary, sexual and bowel function when compared with total hysterectomy. Although surgery is significantly faster and blood loss reduced, these may not translate to clinical benefits. Post-operative febrile morbidity is reduced with subtotal hysterectomy but ongoing cyclical vaginal bleeding is likely to be increased up to a year after surgery. A consensus opinion published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that subtotal hysterectomy should not be recommended by the surgeon as superior to total hysterectomy when indicated for benign disease (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2007</LINK> (reaffirmed 2010)). Women requiring hysterectomy need to be given information based on the evidence presented in this review so that they can make well informed choices, and this is not often routine. An American survey reported that fewer than 20% of gynaecologists offered women a choice between subtotal and total hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Zekam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zekam 2003</LINK>). Women can be informed about the route of hysterectomy by reference to another Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Nieboer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieboer 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the rationales for total, as opposed to subtotal, hysterectomy is the potential risk of cervical cancer when the cervix is left in place, although this review has not been able to assess this risk. The incidence of cervical cancer in women who have had subtotal hysterectomy is rare; a study of 1104 women having this surgery in Denmark between 1978 and 1988 found an incidence of 0.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Storm-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storm 1992</LINK>). The same study, however, reported a 3.3 to 5 fold increased rate of cervical cancer if subtotal hysterectomy was carried out in women aged 50 years or older. Another study of cervical cancer screening in the Midwestern United States showed no differences in screening rates between women who did not have hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Eaker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaker 1998</LINK>). This potential risk is not such an issue for women in countries that have routine cervical screening programs. However, it may be prudent to advise against subtotal hysterectomy in women with a history of high grade cervical lesions, a fear of developing cervical cancer, or cervical cancer screening that is not up to date or unlikely to occur regularly in the future. Even in countries where routine cervical screening exists, it is important that women are adequately counselled prior to and after subtotal hysterectomy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-02 23:37:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although this review has not confirmed the presumed superiority of subtotal hysterectomy for preserving urinary, sexual and bowel function, the conclusions are based on only nine RCTs, only one of which was blinded; with approximately 1500 women in total. There are difficulties in adequately measuring these complex outcomes and more research would be welcome to confirm the provisional conclusions of this review. Larger, double blinded randomised controlled trials with adequate assessment tools are needed because many of the important outcomes are subjective.<BR/>One of the expected disadvantages of total hysterectomy, an increase in post-operative vaginal vault prolapse, has not been confirmed in this review and it is possible that the trials were underpowered to adequately assess this outcome. Prolapse may appear years after hysterectomy and more studies with long term follow up are needed to assess whether cervical preservation results in better support of the vaginal vault.</P>
<P>Four of the six studies in this review compared subtotal abdominal with total abdominal hysterectomy. The short term advantages of the laparoscopic approach have been well documented and it has been argued that these benefits may be even more apparent with subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy. Thus, the comparative benefits of laparoscopic total and subtotal hysterectomy need to be tested in more blinded well designed RCTs.</P>
