<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:43:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when a blood clot is formed in a deep vein, or when it detaches itself and lodges in the lung vessels. These clots can be fatal if blood flow to the heart is blocked. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are given to people who have experienced a VTE, to prevent recurrence. The major complication of this treatment is bleeding. The continuing risk of bleeding with drug use and uncertainty regarding the extent of the risk of recurrence make it important to look at the proper duration of treatment with VKA for these patients. The review authors searched the literature and were able to combine data from 11 randomized controlled clinical trials (3716 participants) comparing different durations of treatment with VKA in patients with a symptomatic VTE. Participants receiving prolonged treatment had around five times lower risk of recurrence of VTE. On the other hand, they had about three times higher risk of bleeding complications. Prolonged treatment did not reduce the risk of death. Prolonged use of VKA strongly reduced the risk of recurrent clots as long as they were used, but benefit decreased over time and the risk of major bleeding remained.<B> </B>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-18 11:08:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, the most frequently used secondary treatment for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) targeted at an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range 2.0 to 3.0). However, based on the continuing risk of bleeding and uncertainty regarding the risk of recurrent VTE, discussion on the proper duration of treatment with VKA for these patients is ongoing. Several studies have compared the risks and benefits of different durations of VKA in patients with VTE. This is the third update of a review first published in 2000.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:43:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven studies with a total of 3716 participants were included. A consistent and strong reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events was observed during prolonged treatment with VKA (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.38) independent of the period elapsed since the index thrombotic event. A statistically significant "rebound" phenomenon (ie, an excess of recurrences shortly after cessation of prolonged treatment) was not found (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.70). In addition, a substantial increase in bleeding complications was observed for patients receiving prolonged treatment during the entire period after randomization (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.49). No reduction in mortality was noted during the entire study period (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.21, P = 0.46).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In conclusion, this review shows that treatment with VKA strongly reduces the risk of recurrent VTE for as long as they are used. However, the absolute risk of recurrent VTE declines over time, although the risk for major bleeding remains. Thus, the efficacy of VKA administration decreases over time since the index event.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:43:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), the collective term for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a disorder that is frequently encountered in medical practice, affecting two to three of every 1000 persons (general population) per year. Venous thromboembolism may occur after surgery, after trauma and immobilization, in cancer patients, during hormonal contraceptive use or pregnancy, and after delivery (provoked), but it also occurs in the absence of such clinical risk factors (unprovoked). Hereditary thrombophilic conditions such as antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies, as well as Factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A mutations, increase the risk for both provoked and unprovoked venous thromboembolic events.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-18 11:06:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most important aim of treatment for patients with VTE is to prevent recurrence, including potentially fatal PE. Patients are usually treated with an initial course of heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (for approximately six days) associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) started simultaneously and continued for a period thereafter. This prolonged use of VKA has proven efficacy in comparison with placebo and low-dose heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagerstedt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerstedt 1985</LINK>). The general consensus is that VKA should be targeted to prolongation of prothrombin time, compatible with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-18 11:09:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the continuing risk of bleeding and uncertainty regarding the risk of recurrent VTE, discussion on the proper duration of oral anticoagulant treatment in patients with VTE is ongoing. Several studies have compared the risks and benefits of different durations of VKA treatment in patients with VTE.</P>
<P>Therefore we evaluated in this review the reduction in the incidence of recurrent VTE and the excess of major bleeding associated with different durations of VKA in patients with VTE.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:44:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All data were analyzed by using the Review Manager software of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). The incidence of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality for the different treatment arms was used to calculate an RR separately for each trial. These RRs were combined across studies, giving weight to the number of events in each of the two treatment groups in each separate study, using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure, which assumes a fixed treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The advisability of combining the trials was addressed by performing a statistical test of heterogeneity, which considers whether differences in treatment effect over individual trials are consistent with natural variation around a constant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1987</LINK>). In addition, qualitative assessment of heterogeneity was performed if indicated. When the probability value of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test was &lt; 0.10 and/or I<SUP>2</SUP> was &gt; 40%, heterogeneity was considered significant. In cases of significant heterogeneity, data from the studies were combined using a random-effects model according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. A Z-test was performed to test the overall effect. If no significant heterogeneity was observed, studies were combined by using a fixed-effect model.</P>

The study of <LINK REF="STD-Eischer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eischer 2009</LINK> showed no difference (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Combining the ten studies revealed that 155 (8.8%) of 1765 participants had thromboembolic complications in the short arm, and only 30 (1.6%) of 1771 participants had thromboembolic complications in the long arm.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:45:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, data from included studies were pooled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different durations of treatment with VKA among participants with symptomatic VTE.</P>
<P>We found a statistically significant reduction in recurrent VTE during the period in which treatment with VKA was prolonged, which was independent of the period elapsed since the index thromboembolic event (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38, P &lt; 0.00001). Although the periods of treatment differed greatly between studies, these periods could be combined because the relative effect of oral anticoagulant treatment was considered and was homogeneous during the period of continuation. Reduction in recurrent VTE during the period that treatment with VKA was prolonged may be somewhat counterbalanced by an excess of recurrences shortly after cessation of prolonged treatment, but this finding did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.70, P = 0.09). In addition, a substantial increase in bleeding complications was observed among participants during the period in which VKA was prolonged (RR 3.44, 95% CI 1.22 to 9.74), and a non&#8211;statistically significant reduction in mortality was shown (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.34).</P>

Furthermore, as in all randomized controlled trials, stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, which means that the current evidence is applicable to patients without increased risk of bleeding.

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. In general, high-quality evidence suggests that prolonged treatment with VKA reduces the risk for recurrent VTE. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that prolonged treatment with VKA increases the risk for major bleeding events. We considered the quality of evidence as moderate because of relatively wide confidence intervals around the point estimate; however the point estimates were very similar across all included trials. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that prolonged treatment with VKA does not reduce mortality significantly, although this was measured in only four studies, one of which reported no deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Kearon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kearon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kearon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kearon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ridker 2003</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:46:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As two review authors selected and extracted the data independently, the risk of potential bias will be low. Furthermore, we consider it unlikely that we have missed important trials in our search for data because of the extensive literature searches that we conducted. As all studies were investigator-initiated, we consider it unlikely that trials with a less favourable outcome have not been published.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-03 09:57:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the relative risk reductions remain stable over time elapsed since the index event (RRs varying around 80%), the absolute risk reduction is decreased over time. This can be illustrated by comparing the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1995</LINK> with that of <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1997</LINK>. The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1995</LINK> showed an absolute risk reduction of 8% to 9% achieved with only two to 4.5 months of prolonged treatment in the early phases after the thrombotic event. This is far more efficient than the absolute risk reduction of 18% achieved with 42 months of additional treatment in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1997</LINK>, six months after the index event. The decline in the incidence of recurrent VTE over time was also observed in the cohort studies of <LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 1996</LINK> and in the meta-analysis of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials performed by <LINK REF="REF-van-Dongen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dongen 2003</LINK>. All of this indicates that a greater amount of effort (ie, years of treatment) will be needed to prevent one recurrent event when the time since the index event is increased. This fact is further complicated by a statistically significant and clinically important increase in bleeding complications, which continued during prolongation. A meta-analysis of 33 trials and prospective cohort studies showed that absolute bleeding risk among participants with VTE treated for longer than three months with VKA was 2.7 per 100 patient-years (<LINK REF="REF-Linkins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linkins 2003</LINK>). The case fatality rate of major bleeding was 13.4% (9.4% to 17.4%), and the rate of intracranial bleeding was 1.15 (1.14 to 16) per 100 patient-years (<LINK REF="REF-Linkins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linkins 2003</LINK>). For participants who received anticoagulants for longer than three months, the case fatality rate of major bleeding remained high at 9.1% (2.5% to 21.7%), and the rate of intracranial bleeding was 0.65 (0.63 to 0.68) per 100 patient-years. This adds to a further decrease in net clinical benefit of prolonged treatment with VKA after VTE.</P>
<P>The decrease in efficacy and the remaining risk for bleeding during continuing treatment indicate that at some point in time, further continuation is not cost-effective, nor is it harmful. Given that the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE decreases over time (<LINK REF="REF-Carrier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrier 2010</LINK>), whereas the risk of major bleeding increases with age, the optimum length of anticoagulant treatment after an episode of VTE remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-De-Jong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jong 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middeldorp-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middeldorp 2011</LINK>). As patients have different risk profiles, it is likely that this optimal duration will vary. However, on the basis of our results alone, the optimal duration cannot be defined. For this purpose, a decision analytic approach could be used by balancing benefit and risk on the basis of individual risk profiles (<LINK REF="REF-Prins-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prins-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that treatment with VKA reduces the risk of recurrent VTE for as long as they are used. However, the absolute risk of recurrent VTE declines over time, although the risk for major bleeding remains. Thus, the efficacy of VKA administration decreases over time from occurrence of the index event.</P>

<P>Further studies are required to determine for how long the duration of treatment with VKA should be extended. As patients have different risk profiles, the optimal duration will vary between specific groups. For this purpose, a decision analytic approach could be used by balancing benefit and risk on the basis of individual risk profiles. Furthermore, the expected increasing use of NOACs for prolonged treatment of VTE may modify the balance between recurrent VTE risk and bleeding.</P>
