<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-06 11:23:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of care after surgery for hip fracture is to get people safely back on their feet and walking again. Initially, people may be asked to rest in bed and restrict weight bearing. Then various strategies to improve mobility, including gait retraining and exercise programmes, are used during hospital stay and often after discharge from hospital.</P>
<P>This review includes evidence from 19 trials involving 1589 participants, generally aged over 65 years. Many of the trials had weak methods, including inadequate follow-up. There was no pooling of data because no two trials were sufficiently alike.</P>
<P>Twelve trials evaluated interventions started soon after hip fracture surgery. Single trials found improved mobility from, respectively, a two-week weight-bearing programme, a quadriceps muscle strengthening exercise programme and electrical stimulation aimed at alleviating pain. Single trials found no significant improvement in mobility from, respectively, a treadmill gait retraining programme, 12 weeks of resistance training, and 16 weeks of weight-bearing exercise. One trial testing ambulation started within 48 hours of surgery found contradictory results. One historic trial found no significant difference in unfavourable outcomes for weight bearing started at two versus 12 weeks. Of two trials evaluating more intensive physiotherapy regimens, one found no difference in recovery, the other reported a higher level of drop-out in the more intensive group. Two trials tested electrical stimulation of the quadriceps: one found no benefit and poor tolerance of the intervention; the other found improved mobility and good tolerance.</P>
<P>Seven trials evaluated interventions started after hospital discharge. Started soon after discharge, two trials found improved outcome after 12 weeks of intensive physical training and a home-based physical therapy programme respectively. Begun after completion of standard physical therapy, one trial found improved outcome after six months of intensive physical training, one trial found increased activity levels from a one year exercise programme, and one trial found no significant effects of home-based resistance or aerobic training. One trial found improved outcome after home-based exercises started around 22 weeks from injury. One trial found home-based weight-bearing exercises starting at seven months produced no significant improvement in mobility.</P>
<P>In summary, the review found there was not enough evidence to determine which are the best strategies, started in hospital or after discharge from hospital, for helping people walk and continue walking after hip fracture surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-07 14:42:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-07 14:42:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Hip fractures, which are fractures of the proximal femur, can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring distal to the hip joint capsule). The majority of hip fractures occur in older people with an average age of around 80 years. Females predominate over males by about four to one and the injury is usually the result of a simple fall. This reflects the loss of skeletal strength from osteoporosis. As well as osteoporosis, people suffering a hip fracture frequently have other medical and physical problems associated with ageing, including impaired mobility.</P>
<P>Currently, the majority of hip fractures are treated surgically, which enables earlier mobilisation of the patient and avoids some of the complications of prolonged recumbency and immobilisation. Surgery entails either internal fixation where the fracture is fixed using various implants and thereby retaining the femoral head, or by replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis.</P>
<P>Although surgery is generally successful, few people recover fully from their hip fracture.</P>
<P>Between 5% to 10% of patients die within one month of their hip fracture. About a third of patients will have died by one year after fracture, compared with an expected annual mortality of about 10% in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-Roche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roche 2005</LINK>). Most survivors fail to regain their former levels of mobility and activity, and many become more dependent and around 10% of survivors will be unable to return to their previous residence (<LINK REF="REF-Magaziner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magaziner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-10-22 11:48:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>A variety of post-operative care programmes following surgery for hip fractures have been employed. In the early stages, these include resting the patient in bed ('bed rest') and restricted weight bearing. Mobilisation is a major component of post-operative care and rehabilitation. Various mobilisation strategies are in use. These aim to get people out of bed, back on their feet, weight-bearing, moving and walking. Other strategies for mobilisation relate to the nature of the physiotherapy or exercise regimens used. These include mobilisation interventions, such as exercise, training and muscle stimulation, which aim to minimise impairments (such as reduced strength) and improve the physical performance of walking.</P>
<P>This review continues to focus on mobilisation strategies. Thus trials testing interventions, including multi-component interventions, aimed at enhancing activities of daily living and other aspects of functioning rather than specifically mobilisation are not included here. Other aspects of rehabilitation after hip fracture such as single therapy programmes specifically designed to improve physical and psychosocial functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Crotty-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crotty 2010</LINK>), multidisciplinary care programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2009</LINK>) and nutritional supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2006</LINK>) are considered within separate Cochrane reviews.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-10-22 11:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The timing and extent of weight bearing form part of any mobilisation strategy after hip fracture surgery. Other components of mobilisation strategies generally involve various forms of exercise regimens; again the extent and timing of these will vary. The aim of these is to improve the patient's walking ability and associated functioning. The possibility of a refracture and other complications usually affects the decisions as to when to allow restricted or full weight bearing on the injured hip and the subsequent pace and stages of physical rehabilitation. In particular, the patient is at risk of several complications of fracture healing following internal fixation of a hip fracture. For example, the implant may fail to hold the fracture or 'cut-out' of the bone (penetration of the implant from the proximal femur either into the hip joint or external to the femur) causing pain and impaired mobility. This may require revision surgery to re-fix the fracture, or replace the femoral head with an arthroplasty. Other complications of fracture healing that may occur are non-union of the fracture (that is failure of the fracture to heal) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (also termed segmental collapse or aseptic necrosis).</P>
<P>Different considerations feature in the later stages of rehabilitation, which mainly occurs after discharge from hospital and in the community or residential care setting. As before, mobilisation strategies aim to improve the patient's walking ability and associated functioning. However, there may be a greater emphasis on independent and confident ambulation, with the correct use of ambulatory aids and specific interventions, such as muscle strengthening exercises, aimed at minimising or correcting impairments; for example, various gait problems that often manifest as a limp.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-10-22 14:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Worldwide, an estimated 1.26 million hip fractures occurred in adults in 1990, with predictions of numbers rising to between 7.3 and 21.3 million by the year 2050; the steepest increases being expected in Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Gullberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gullberg 1997</LINK>). Some more recent studies have revealed and predicted some levelling off of the rates of hip fracture in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 2010</LINK>). This trend, which was not found in males, may partly reflect the impact of the pharmacological management of osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2009</LINK>). However, given the increasing number of older people worldwide, the total numbers of hip fracture cases and their economic consequences are likely to rise substantively (<LINK REF="REF-Konnopka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konnopka 2009</LINK>). This together with the generally unfavourable outcome in survivors, many of whom end up more dependent and move into residential care, means that the burden on society from hip fractures is immense and increasing. Improving mobility outcomes is key to relieving the burden on the individuals, their carers and society. The previous version of this review noted the insufficiency of the evidence to inform practice, but it also located ongoing trials that potentially could help address this deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2007</LINK>). This update continues the systematic review of the evidence on mobilisation strategies for these fractures.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-05 06:19:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effects of different interventions and strategies aimed at improving mobility and physical functioning after hip fracture surgery in adults. </P>
<P>We have grouped trials according to the basic stage in the rehabilitation process when the trial intervention(s) commenced: either as an inpatient (early post-operative rehabilitation) or following discharge from inpatient care (continuation or community rehabilitation) after surgery for a hip fracture. Some further grouping of the post-discharge trials according to the stage in the rehabilitation process (e.g. post 'standard' rehabilitation) was also undertaken.</P>
<P>We considered comparisons between either a) the provision of any specific mobilisation strategy or programme and non-provision or b) different mobilisation strategies or programmes for people after surgery for a hip fracture.</P>

<P>For this update, initial scrutiny of electronic database downloads was by HH.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-10-21 16:53:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Risk of bias was independently assessed, without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports, by at least two authors for newly included trials, and by at least one author for trials that had been assessed in previous versions of the review. The assessment form was piloted using two trials. Between rater and between versions consistency in assessment was checked by HH at data entry. All differences were resolved by discussion. We used the tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered subjective outcomes (mobility, functional outcomes, pain) and 'hard' outcomes (death, complications, readmission, re-operation) separately in our assessment of blinding and completeness of outcome data. We assessed two additional sources of bias: bias resulting from imbalances in key baseline characteristics (e.g. pre-injury mobility, mental test score, type of surgery); and performance bias such as that resulting from lack of comparability in the experience of care providers.</P>
<P>Additionally, we assessed five other aspects of trial design and reporting that would help us judge the applicability of the trial findings. The five aspects were: definition of the study population; description of the interventions; definition of primary outcome measures; length of follow-up; and assessment of compliance/adherence with interventions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>All 19 included trials were published as full reports in journals, their availability ranging from 1968 (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK>) to 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2009</LINK>). Details of study methods, participants, interventions and outcome measurement for the individual studies are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and summarised below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen trials were randomised clinical trials, although two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsauo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsauo 2005</LINK>) provided no details of their method of randomisation and thus use of quasi-randomised methods for sequence generation cannot be ruled out. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK> was a quasi-randomised trial using alternation for treatment allocation. Fourteen trials had two comparison groups, whereas two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mangione-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mangione 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherrington-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrington 2004</LINK>) had three comparison groups and two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2007</LINK>) had four comparison groups although only three of each trial are included in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>The 19 included trials involved a total of 1589 patients. Study size ranged from 26 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK>) to 273 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>The trials were conducted in eight different countries: Australia (7 trials); Denmark (1); Finland (1); Germany (1); Russia (1); Taiwan (1); UK (4); and USA (3). Of the 12 trials examining primarily inpatient rehabilitation, 10 were single-centre and two were multi-centre. Participants of four trials testing post-discharge interventions were from single hospitals, whereas they were from several hospitals but still from the same region in the other three community or continuing rehabilitation trials. Some details of the timing of trial recruitment provided for 15 included trials (<I>see</I> the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) show <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK> had the earliest start date (1961) and <LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2007</LINK>, the most recent start date (2004).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The majority of participants in each trial were women (67% to 100% of trial population). Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauridsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lauridsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2007</LINK>) only included women. The mean ages of trial participants ranged from 71 years (<LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2007</LINK>) to 84 years (<LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2009</LINK>); and was 80 or above in 11 trials. Thirteen trials set lower age limits, ranging from 50 years (<LINK REF="STD-Karumo-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Karumo 1977</LINK>) to 75 years (<LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>). Thirteen trials, including all seven post-discharge intervention trials, specially excluded people with various extents of cognitive impairment; judged according to various criteria and assessment instruments. Explicit exclusion criteria relating to previous and/or current immobility, and/or medical conditions affecting mobility were stated in all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tsauo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsauo 2005</LINK>. Aside from <LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2007</LINK>, which specified trochanteric fractures, <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK> (displaced intracapsular fractures), and <LINK REF="STD-Karumo-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Karumo 1977</LINK> (femoral neck fractures), the included trials did not select on type of hip fracture. While not stated explicitly in some trials, it is very likely that all trial participants had surgery for a hip fracture except for three participants in <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK> who had elective hip surgery and 12 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK> who were treated for another lower limb fracture.</P>

<P>At the end of follow-up, three intervention group participants had moved to live with relatives or into a nursing home compared with four in the control group (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.6</LINK>).

<LINK REF="CMP-012.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.7</LINK>). Self-reported physical activity which was low at baseline in both groups, though slightly higher in the intensive group, increased during the training period in the intensive group but was diminishing back to the baseline values by six-months follow-up.

<P>Two intensive group participants and one control group participant did not start their allocated group sessions, and a further participant of the intensive group gave up after starting "because of motivational reasons".

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-11-25 15:50:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>To inform consideration of applicability of the evidence from individual trials, we have increased the details given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> on the study populations and interventions. Additionally, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows our assessments for each trial of five aspects of relevance to ascertaining external validity: definition of the study population, description of the interventions, definition of primary outcome measures, length of follow-up, assessment of compliance. Clearly unhelpful is where there are incomplete descriptions of study inclusion (two trials), interventions (four trials) or outcomes (three trials). The timing of outcome measurement was considered suboptimal in 16 trials, and especially in those where participants were followed-up to either hospital discharge or only until the end of the intervention. Some assessment of compliance with allocated interventions or control interventions was reported in seven trials, but seven other trials which reported compliance only did so for the active intervention group(s).</P>
<P>Also, problematic in terms of applicability are the differences in settings, in definitive treatment (such as type of surgery), in health care provision and policy including the extent of support post hospital discharge, and the expectations and social norms of people in different parts of the world. Additionally, the potential for trial findings to be influenced by the 'special' characters of the clinicians providing the care cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the study populations are also highly relevant. For instance, it is notable that 13 trials, including all seven post-discharge intervention trials, excluded people with various levels of cognitive impairment. The acceptability and tolerance of interventions by hip fracture patients is also important; and a recurring theme in our commentary on individual comparisons in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. For instance, we suggest that the contrasting results for tolerability of electrical stimulation of the quadriceps in <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK> points to the possibility that the population that can tolerate electrical stimulation may be restricted to fitter formerly more independent patients.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-02-14 10:56:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>A cautious interpretation of the findings of single trials is necessary. Trial size is an important consideration and most of the included trials are unlikely to have been sufficiently powered to detect between-group differences for a range of outcome measures, should they exist. The interpretation of results in this review is primarily based on the statistical significance of difference between the intervention and comparison groups after a period of intervention. It is noteworthy that many of the studies indicated between group differences in a range of outcome measures which tended to favour intervention groups but do not reach statistical significance. This is illustrated graphically in the forest plots. Several factors, including the generally large variation in baseline characteristics and outcome of patients with hip fracture and the effects of the natural recovery process over time, increase the numbers needed in these trials for the detection of statistically significant differences between intervention approaches.</P>
<P>There is a strong possibility of biased results resulting from methodological weaknesses of several trials. Thirteen trials were judged at high risk of bias on at least one aspect, more frequently a lack of blinding (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Incomplete outcome data, or failure to address this adequately, was also a common source of bias (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). One frequent inadequacy of the trials was the short-term nature of the outcome assessment. In particular, the follow up of trial participants only up to the end of the intervention, while administratively convenient, could give misleading results; and the question of whether the effect of the intervention persists in the longer term remains unanswered.</P>
<P>One key reason for the scarcity of trials may be because the evaluation of rehabilitation interventions is difficult to do well. These are generally complex interventions with considerable variation in practice including the often adaptive nature of rehabilitation, where treatment is varied according to the perceived needs and progress of individual patients. Some aspects of trial methodology, notably concealment of allocation, are always possible but others, such as blinding, are more of a challenge for these trials. In particular, blinding of participants is not possible in trials of many physical interventions such as exercise. Blinding of outcome assessors is possible for tests of mobility but not for self-reported outcomes where the participant is effectively the outcome assessor.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-10-22 11:28:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Our search for trials was comprehensive but it is likely that we have missed some; perhaps more likely in this update because we did not search conference proceedings. However, the growing momentum of trial registration may help reduce the risk of publication bias in future and we note that some trials do get published eventually. The inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK>, which we had excluded in the previous version, is a case in point and noteworthy too in that its findings differed from those of the previously included trial testing electrostimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>While we consider that we have included and excluded trials appropriately, the variety and complexity of trial interventions encountered in the eligible trials sometimes made it hard to make this decision. Indeed, we have sometimes gone quite far with processing trials that we subsequently realised were not suitable. These have required us to reconsider and clarify our inclusion criteria, such as setting a limit on the time for starting the intervention at one year. We have also excluded trials such as <LINK REF="STD-Allegrante-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Allegrante 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tinetti-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tinetti 1999</LINK> that tested multifactorial interventions, and other trials that primarily focused on elective hip surgery. The reason for excluding the first category is that it is not possible to separate out the effects of the mobilisation component of multifactorial interventions. Although the aim of these trials is to restore or augment function, we have kept our focus on mobilisation and mobility. These latter remain key objectives for people after hip fracture surgery. The exclusion of trials focusing on elective hip replacement surgery reflects that these populations are likely to differ in important ways to the generally older and frailer populations sustaining a hip fracture.</P>
<P>Various choices have arisen in the compilation of the analyses of this review. Generally, the results at final follow-up rather than 'change scores' (change from baseline) have been presented. This can result in a disparity between the results presented here for individual trials and their trial reports. Though disconcerting, we opted for a consistent approach in the review and these disparities perhaps more underline that these are small trials where randomisation is unlikely to achieve populations that are comparable in all key characteristics.</P>
<P>We decided meta-analysis was inappropriate because of the differences in the included trials in terms of trial participants, settings, interventions, or a combination of these. Additionally, it was clear that the variation in the outcome measures of different trials would generally have precluded data pooling but the use of standardised mean differences can be valuable in this situation. Noting that the comparisons tested by the included trials are consistent with a general comparison of more intensive versus less intensive intervention, we considered whether it would be appropriate to set up meta-analyses for the two established rehabilitation stages (early (inpatient), continuation (community)) to examine the broad question of whether the provision of more intensive therapy, in whatever form, would improve mobility in a way that was safe and acceptable to patients. As indicated, the disparity in outcome measures and measurement would have severely restricted data pooling but there is also the difficulties of interpretation of the findings of these meta-analyses as they only address the main question and thus will not inform readily the choice of intervention. Arguably, the pooling of data for different measures of mobility from the results of the various exercise-based programmes featured in this review can still be of value from the more general perspective of informing of health funders and managers. As in <LINK REF="REF-Sherrington-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrington 2008</LINK>, meta-regression can then be used to explore heterogeneity and thus attempt to identify key differences in the trials, including interventions and timing, that might affect outcome. The limitations in the currently available data remain, however.</P>
<P>Lastly, this review presented another dilemma resulting from one of the authors (Catherine Sherrington) being the lead investigator of three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sherrington-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrington 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherrington-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrington 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherrington-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrington 2004</LINK>), and an investigator on <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2009</LINK>. We considered it was important that all processing of these trials was carried out independently of Sherrington. While this avoided conflict of interest, it may have downplayed the potential advantages of Sherrington's insights on the results of her trials.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-03 10:54:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-08 15:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine the effects of any particular mobilisation strategy or programme started either in the early or later rehabilitation period after hip fracture surgery. However, the included trials generally indicate that it is possible to enhance mobility after hip fracture though the optimal method to achieve this remains unclear. While the most successful programmes evaluated to date have involved intensive supervised ongoing exercise, the optimal format and resource implications for these strategies are not established.</P>
<P>Clearly, intervention is required to restore and enhance mobilisation in older people after surgery for hip fracture. The interventions chosen should match the needs of individual patients and be based on agreed local practice guidelines. Such guidelines, which should acknowledge and allow for the insufficiency of the underlying evidence to inform practice, should also include consideration of the continued risk of further falls and fractures and potential for functional decline in this often frail patient population.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-12-03 10:54:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The presence of ongoing trials points to the importance of maintaining this review, but further primary research in the form of sufficiently powered, preferably multi-centred, high quality randomised controlled trials is also required to inform practice. Such research should focus on interventions that are likely to have a beneficial overall, long-term impact; thus, trials should have long-term (one year or more) and comprehensive follow up including the collection of validated and patient-orientated outcome measures, and economic outcomes. Given the investment required for such trials, priority questions and areas need to be identified. We consider that this needs to be opened up for a general debate but some clues can be gained from this review and the following considerations.</P>
<P>This review already gives some indication of the variety of questions that clinicians consider important and have, we assume, successfully justified to ethics committees and, often, to funders. With some exceptions, such as <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK> which is not relevant to current practice, the questions evaluated incompletely by these trials remain pertinent. Some can be considered as pilot studies and after appropriate adjustments, such as to the study design and perhaps to the interventions, a potentially useful trial will emerge.</P>
<P>It is debatable whether future research priorities should be on the evaluation of multi-facetted or multi-component interventions (excluded from this review when not solely aimed at mobilisation) with mobilisation components, rather than mobilisation interventions or programmes by themselves. This is particularly relevant to rehabilitation after discharge from hospital, which is an increasingly important area. Lessons from the literature on fall prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2009</LINK>) and strength training (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009</LINK>) in older people may be applicable here as well as generally to rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery. We consider, however, that it is still useful to investigate mobilisation strategies in themselves, particularly as these will form a substantive part of any rehabilitation intervention for this patient group.</P>
<P>Some consideration of these trials must be given to the differences in the physical and mental capacities of people with hip fracture. Different interventions may be suitable for different subgroups of hip fracture patients: for instance, the more frail versus more physically able. Thus, trials could also investigate whether differing responses to interventions occur among different subgroups of hip fracture patients. Of course such investigations should take into account methodological concerns about excessive subgroup analyses in clinical trials and pre-specify subgroups and use appropriate statistical techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Development of a standard portfolio of validated and patient-orientated outcome measures for trials would enable meta-analysis of the results of future trials.</P>

Weight-bearing exercise twice daily for a total of 60 minutes per day for 16 weeks. Five weight-bearing exercises were prescribed in addition to walking on a treadmill with partial body weight support using a harness (for inpatients) or a walking programme (after hospital discharge). The five weight-bearing exercises used for both legs included stepping in different directions, standing up and sitting down, tapping the foot and stepping onto and off a block. Hand support could be used if necessary. The exercises were progressed by reducing support from the hands, increasing block height, decreasing chair height and increasing the number of repetitions.

Exercises progressed by increasing the number of repetitions, lessening the hand support, increasing the height of blocks, decreasing height of surface from which the participants was standing up etc.<BR/>versus<BR/>2. Home-based non-weight-bearing exercises (performed in the supine position) prescribed by a physiotherapist.

<I>Early assisted ambulation (within 48 hours) versus delayed assisted ambulation after surgery (fixation or hemiarthroplasty)</I>
<BR/>Over one third of the participants allocated early ambulation in <LINK REF="STD-Oldmeadow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oldmeadow 2006</LINK> did not start within 48 hours. Nonetheless, data were provided to perform intention-to-treat analysis. However, a limitation of this trial was that mobility outcome data were only provided at seven days and that participants were only followed-up to discharge from the acute ward. Additionally, as well as incomplete data for continuous outcomes, there were incomplete results for mobility outcomes of transfers and negotiating steps in terms of requiring assistance or inability to perform even with assistance. Hence, caution is required in the interpretation of the results favouring the early mobilisation group in terms of transfers and walking distance, especially in the context of the significantly greater number of participants of this group who were unable to negotiate a step at all or without assistance. While a few more early ambulation group participants were discharged home, the length of hospital stay was also greater for this group; neither of these results reached statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Oldmeadow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oldmeadow 2006</LINK> referred to the current practice in their hospital of prescribing bedrest "in the presence of cardiovascular challenge" and it is noteworthy that seven of the 10 participants of the early ambulation group who started after 48 hours were tested for troponin. This perhaps points to some consideration of additional assessment of patients before early ambulation and adjustment to the inclusion criteria of any future trial evaluating early ambulation.</P>

<I>Weight bearing at two weeks versus 12 weeks after internal fixation of a displaced intracapsular fracture</I>
<BR/>The one included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK>) used a method of internal fixation (sliding nail plate) that is generally no longer used to treat this fracture. Additionally, current recommended practice is to mobilise patients as soon as practical after surgery, and lessen the risk of the complications of immobilisation such as thrombosis and pressure damage (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>). Thus it is difficult to see how the results of this study comparing weight bearing at two versus 12 weeks could be translated to current practice. Despite the limited findings for <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1968</LINK> of no difference in unfavourable outcome, including mortality and non-union, this trial is at high risk of bias including incomplete ascertainment of outcome and thus clinically important differences cannot be ruled out.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lauridsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lauridsen 2002</LINK>
</P>
<P>In practice, routine or standard physiotherapy is not a fixed item and there is considerably variety, for instance in the timing, extent and nature of the physiotherapy. This is illustrated by the differences between the two trials in this category, both of which aimed to investigate an intensification of physiotherapy. It is noteworthy that the routine regimen of 30 minutes physiotherapy each day for the control group of <LINK REF="STD-Karumo-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Karumo 1977</LINK> would be considered by some to be more than the standard for many patients after a hip fracture. The control group of <LINK REF="STD-Lauridsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lauridsen 2002</LINK> were scheduled for 15 to 30 minutes physiotherapy each week day and had a median of 12 minutes per day.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Karumo-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Karumo 1977</LINK> may have been seriously compromised by poor methodology, including the exclusion of the results of 13 trial participants with incomplete follow-up: it is certain that some of these had died and others may have had other adverse outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Karumo-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Karumo 1977</LINK> also had inadequate follow-up and failed to present comprehensive quantitative results to enable confirmation of their conclusions, namely of the similarity in outcome of the two groups and thus the lack of evidence of a benefit from a more intensive physiotherapy regimen.</P>
<P>Follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Lauridsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lauridsen 2002</LINK> was only until hospital discharge. Nearly half of the participants withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-Lauridsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lauridsen 2002</LINK> and did not complete the training programme; significantly more drop-outs were in the intensive group. The main message from this trial is that the particular intensification regimen on offer, comprising two hours of physiotherapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, was beyond the capacity of some patients and rarely taken up to the full amount even in those patients who had completed training.</P>

<BR/>It is not possible to draw any conclusions on overall effect of treadmill gait training compared with conventional gait training from the limited and potentially biased findings of <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1991</LINK>. Given the potential for, and potential use of, treadmill training to enhance the recovery of mobility of hip fracture patients, further research seems merited. However, one excluded trial that set out to do this seems to have been abandoned (<LINK REF="STD-Giangregorio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Giangregorio 2005</LINK>)<BR/>

</P>
<P>The two trials testing electrical stimulation had different approaches and rather different findings. <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK> found no evidence of an effect but noted also poor tolerance of electrical stimulation. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK> provided some evidence that electrical stimulation improved mobility; and that the effect persisted, even increased, after the end of the six weeks regimen. <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK> found that electrical stimulation was fairly well tolerated by the trial participants. It is possible that the difference in the findings of the two trials mainly reflects differences in the stimulation regimens: that of <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK> was considerably shorter in duration of exposure. Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK> caused the maximum quadriceps contraction they could stimulate, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK> used an intensity sufficient to cause visible muscle contraction. However, neither trial was sufficiently powered to conclusively establish the effects of electrical stimulation on mobility after hip fracture.</P>
<P>Before the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK>, we proposed that larger pragmatic studies with longer-term follow-up were needed to establish whether the potential short term gains in mobility "translate into long-term benefits" (<LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2002</LINK>). The low tolerability of electrical stimulation without marked improvement in mobility and function in <LINK REF="STD-Braid-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Braid 2008</LINK> points to the possibility that the population that can tolerate electrical stimulation may be restricted to fitter formerly more independent patients.<BR/>

<BR/>The results for electrical stimulation aimed at alleviating pain and enhancing recovery in <LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2007</LINK> are highly favourable in terms of pain, the interference by pain on walking ability, hip flexion and blinded assessment by an orthopaedic surgeon of recovery at 10 days. As noted by the trial authors, the patients were notably younger than in many other populations (mean age 71 years), functionally independent and none had dementia. Additionally, the follow-up stopped just after the final treatment session and a direct outcome measure of mobility was absent. Thus the impact on mobility is uncertain as is the persistence of the effect in the long term. These point to the need for further research.</P>

This was a well-conducted and reported trial but, particularly, lack of care provider blinding may have affected the trial conduct. The trialists speculated that one reason for the lack of differences between the two treatment groups was that the therapists may have modified the programme for participants in the control group. A longer follow-up, outside the treatment period would have been desirable. While the trialists reported greater benefit for participants with cognitive impairment (with family carer available), as acknowledged, the subgroup analyses conducted by the trial were <I>ad hoc</I>.</P>

<I>Twelve weeks of intensive physical training versus placebo motor activity starting about four to five weeks after surgery upon discharge from inpatient rehabilitation</I>
<BR/>Participants who adhered to the intensive training programme in <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK> had superior mobility and functional motor performance, muscle strength, and fewer fall-related behavioural problems. Though the level of physical activity in the intensive training group dropped to almost baseline levels three months after the cessation of training, there was some persistence in the improvements in muscle strength and some other variables in this group. Only minor adverse effects were reported and there were none that could not be resolved. Thus, this well-conducted trial provides some reasonable evidence of the potential benefits of intensive physical training after hospital discharge. There are, however, some aspects of the trial that caution against drawing these conclusions. Firstly, the trial is small and the results of four participants (14% of the trial population) are not available. Secondly, the control group received no strength and balance training at all; this was excluded from the routine physiotherapy provided to both groups. Thus, the question tested by the trial could be interpreted as whether strength and balance training is effective rather than whether intensive physical training is effective. Furthermore, though the choice by <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK> to remove the strength and balance training from the routine physiotherapy is an understandable one, it does give problems regarding applicability to other settings where strength and balance training are part of the routinely-provided physiotherapy for such patients. The provision of transport to attend training sessions seemed to have paid dividends in terms of adherence in this trial and perhaps should be taken on board as a general principle.</P>
<P>Persistence or otherwise of training effects is a question that hangs over some of the other trials included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK> gave some evidence of an often diminished but still persisting effect after three months. The real implications of this, in terms of actually mobility, quality of life and sustained functional independence in people aged 75 years or older who are already fairly frail and mainly sedentary, cannot be assessed here from the small sample available. The finding that the increased level of physical activity during the intensive training period did not persist after training ended supports <LINK REF="STD-Hauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hauer 2002</LINK>'s call for a continuing intervention but the nature of this is not established by this trial.</P>

<BR/>The findings of an earlier improvement in quality of life and functional ability from home-based physical therapy by <LINK REF="STD-Tsauo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tsauo 2005</LINK> are plausible but should be interpreted with caution given the exclusion of data from a large proportion (54%) of participants.

The special context of this small study, conducted in Taiwan, also merits consideration in terms of the applicability of trial findings. For instance, there is no reimbursement in the insurance system for home-based physiotherapy after hospital discharge.</P>

<BR/>The primary focus of <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2007</LINK> was on psychological/behavioural outcomes of self-efficacy and expectations, and the only mobility outcomes relevant to this review related to activity levels. Data provided for the exercises only group confirmed that activity levels were greater than in the control group. Yet, this was reported as not being the case for exercises group that included a motivational intervention. The stipulation that no encouragement should be given in the exercises group is interesting in that encouragement is probably a de facto part of most rehabilitation interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2007</LINK> was judged to have a high risk of bias performance bias. In part this resulted from the large variation (28 to 200 days) in the time from fracture to the first intervention visit from trainer. This was timing was determined by the participants, and points to a problem of pragmatic trials of this type. A related issue was the poor acceptability of the interventions, where 35% and 29% of the two exercise intervention groups were not willing to have any intervention visits, and adherence, where the mean numbers of visits were under half of the maximum visits scheduled over one year.<BR/>

<BR/>The intervention provided in <LINK REF="STD-Binder-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Binder 2004</LINK> was very intensive (three times weekly) and highly supervised (2 to 5 participants per instructor for the first three months) and longer lasting (six months) than the other programmes evaluated in the included trials. <LINK REF="STD-Binder-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Binder 2004</LINK> found the largest effect for an intervention programme with clinically important between-group differences for most key variables. Of particular note is the effect on more global measures (e.g. SF-36 Physical Function subscale score mean difference 11.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 21.58). This trial shows that is it possible to enhance physical outcome after hip fracture by an intensive intervention. It does not show whether these improvements persist after the end of rehabilitation (follow up was only up to the end of the intervention) or whether the risk of decline and nursing home placement was averted in the target group of patients. <LINK REF="STD-Binder-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Binder 2004</LINK> did not collect detailed costs of their intervention and acknowledged that it was unclear whether the cost of the 72 treatment sessions would be reimbursed in the USA.

<I>Twelve weeks of supervised home-based moderate to high intensity resistance training versus aerobic exercise training versus education control group after completion of usual physical therapy</I>
<BR/>This three-group small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mangione-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mangione 2005</LINK>) is unlikely to have had sufficient power to detect between-group differences. The interventions tested are of a higher intensity than those in most of the other trials in this review. The modification of resistance training equipment for use at home is interesting as many people after hip fracture may prefer to exercise at home rather than attending a centre. From the high reports of adherence, the intervention appears to have been well-tolerated by participants although the fact that six of the 17 resistance training participants dropped out of the study (compared with one from each of the other two groups) may indicate a higher rate of dissatisfaction or complications in this group. It could also reflect that the participants were unaccustomed to exercising at such a high intensity. <LINK REF="STD-Mangione-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mangione 2005</LINK> is especially compromised by the large variation in the start time of participation in the study, and particularly that the control group participants started on average seven weeks earlier than participants of the two intervention groups.

<I>Four months of home-based weight-bearing exercises versus home-based non-weight-bearing exercises (performed in the supine position) versus no specific instructions started 22 weeks after hip fracture</I>
<BR/>Based on measures of improvement from baseline assessment rather than final outcome measures, <LINK REF="STD-Sherrington-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sherrington 2004</LINK> concluded that "a weight-bearing home exercise program can improve balance and functional ability to a greater extent than a non-weight bearing program or no intervention among older people who have completed usual care after a fall-related hip fracture." These conclusions are not supported by the analyses of the post-intervention assessments presented in this review. Though the majority of both objective and subjective outcome measures show no statistically significant differences for any of the four comparisons, the consistency of the results for mobility, functional, strength and balance outcomes gives some indication of possible benefit of a home-based exercise programme, whether weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing. However, the loss to follow-up, the short-term follow up and the lack of assessor blinding could distort these findings and it is notable that over a quarter of those in the two exercise groups who were assessed considered that the exercises were not even of moderate usefulness.<BR/>
<BR/>Differences between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercise groups at post-test were also not statistically significant. It is noteworthy that the weight-bearing exercises, which involve exercises that are more relevant to activities of daily life, did not appear to enhance physical performance and, while not evidently associated with a greater risk of falling, were judged as more difficult and painful to do by participants. However, this comparison, like the others, is underpowered and more evidence is required to establish the benefits or otherwise of home-based exercises and whether an emphasis on weight-bearing exercises is appropriate.</P>
<P>A comparison of weight-bearing exercises versus either non-weight-bearing exercises or no exercises was considered, based on the clinical impression of the lead investigator (<LINK REF="REF-Sherrington-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherrington 2004a</LINK>) of this trial that non-weight-bearing exercises were relatively ineffectual. Due to the aforementioned concern of bias arising from a potential conflict of interest, this comparison has been placed in reserve until the inclusion of another trial testing a similar comparison in this setting.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of outcome measures sought in versions of the review before Issue 2, 2010</HEADING>
<P>While the outcomes sought remain basically unchanged from previous versions (<I>see</I> above), this section was restructured to emphasise the main focus of the interventions, which is to safely restore or enhance mobility, and to apply to the whole rehabilitation period.</P>
<P>(1) Mobility and other related functional outcomes (including impairment)<BR/>(a) Mobility/walking ability:</P>
<UL>
<LI>restoration of pre-fracture mobility/walking ability;</LI>
<LI>use of walking aids/need for assistance;</LI>
<LI>time to mobilisation/regain of final mobility status.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(b) Gait assessment and other objective measures of impairment and function:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>various gait parameters, limp;</LI>
<LI>functional performance measures: for example, timed up and go;</LI>
<LI>strength, balance, range of motion.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(c) Falls and fear of falling.<BR/>(d) General functioning:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>return to living at home;</LI>
<LI>other functional outcomes as listed in each study;</LI>
<LI>health related quality of life measures: especially physical domains.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(e) Pain (persistent pain at the final follow-up assessment).</P>
<P>(2) Mortality and complications<BR/>(a) Mortality (within the follow-up period of the study).<BR/>(b) Fracture healing complications:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>surgical complications of fixation within the follow-up period of the study. This includes non-union of the fracture (the definition of non-union is that used within each individual study, and this outcome includes early re-displacement of the fracture), avascular necrosis and other complications as detailed in each individual study;</LI>
<LI>re-operation (within the follow-up period of the study).</LI>
</UL>
<P>(c) Poor anatomical restoration:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>shortening (more than 2 centimetres);</LI>
<LI>varus deformity;</LI>
<LI>external rotation deformity ( &gt; 20 degrees).</LI>
</UL>
<P>(d) Post-operative medical complications as detailed in each individual study. These include pneumonia, thromboembolic complications (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and other complications as listed.</P>
<P>(3) Resources<BR/>The type of resources considered will depend on the context and stage of rehabilitation. These include length of hospital stay (in days), number of physiotherapy sessions, number of outpatient attendances and need for special care.</P>
<P>(4) Other<BR/>These include patient satisfaction and adherence to interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Prompted by editorial comments for the fourth update, we signal our intention to revise this list for the next update as follows:</P>
<P>(3) Patient satisfaction, including acceptability of interventions, and adherence</P>
<P>(4) Resources</P>

<P>1. Was there clear concealment of allocation?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 3 (and code A) if allocation clearly concealed (e.g. numbered sealed opaque envelopes drawn consecutively). Score 2 (and code B) if there was a possible chance of disclosure before allocation. Score 1 (and code B) if the method of allocation concealment or randomisation was not stated or was unclear. Score 0 (and code C) if allocation concealment was clearly not concealed such as those using quasi-randomisation (e.g. even or odd date of birth).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>2. Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria clearly defined?</P>
</TD>
<TD>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>3. Were the outcomes of participants who withdrew or who were excluded after allocation described and included in an intention-to-treat analysis?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if yes or text states that no withdrawals occurred or data are presented clearly showing 'participant flow' which allows this to be inferred. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>4. Were the treatment and control groups adequately described at entry and if so were the groups well matched, or appropriate co-variate adjustment made?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if at least four admission details given (e.g. age, sex, pre-injury mobility, function score, mental test score, fracture type, type of surgery) with either no important difference between groups or appropriate adjustment made. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>5. Were the care programmes other than the trial options identical?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if text states they were or this can be inferred. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>6. Was compliance assessed with documentation of patients' actual ambulatory function (such as weight bearing)?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if yes. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>7. Were all the outcome measures clearly defined in the text with a definition of any ambiguous terms encountered?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if yes. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>8. Were the outcome assessors blind to assignment status?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Score 1 if assessors of anatomical restoration, pain and function at follow-up were blinded to treatment outcome. Otherwise score 0.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>9. Was the timing of outcome measures appropriate?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A minimum of 12 months follow-up for all surviving participants. Score 1 if yes. Otherwise score 0.</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>10. Was loss to follow-up reported and if so were less than 5% of participants lost to follow-up?</P>
