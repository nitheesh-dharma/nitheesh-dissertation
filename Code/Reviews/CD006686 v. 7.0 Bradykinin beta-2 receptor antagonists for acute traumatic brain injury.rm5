<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-16 15:27:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Not all damage to the brain occurs at the moment of injury. The injury sustained at the moment of impact (primary brain injury) initiates a sequence of mechanisms which cause further brain damage (secondary brain injury).</P>
<P>One consequence of the mechanisms triggered by primary injury is the accumulation of fluid within the brain. This condition is known as cerebral oedema and leads to raised intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull), which contributes to secondary brain injury.</P>
<P>The use of a group of drugs known as bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists is being investigated as a potential treatment for TBI. It is proposed that they can inhibit the mechanism which causes cerebral oedema and therefore prevent the elevation of intracranial pressure with subsequent brain damage.</P>
<P>The authors of this review searched for all randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists in traumatically brain injured patients. The authors found four trials involving 406 patients. Whilst the overall effect estimates suggest that bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists may reduce mortality and disability, they also suggest that they may increase the number of serious adverse events. However, all of these results are consistent with the play of chance. The findings indicate that there is no evidence to support the use of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists for TBI.</P>
<P>Bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists are not presently registered for use in patients. Because the safety and effectiveness of bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists have not been reliably ascertained, they should not be used outside the context of well conducted trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-29 11:21:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-01-29 10:06:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), defined as a blow or jolt to the head or penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>), is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The majority of TBI occurs in the 15 to 45 years age group, with the highest rate amongst males (<LINK REF="REF-Bruns-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruns 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tagliaferri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tagliaferri 2006</LINK>). Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are the leading cause of TBI accounting for 40% to 50% of serious injuries, followed by falls and violence (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). A review of European epidemiological data by <LINK REF="REF-Tagliaferri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tagliaferri 2006</LINK> et al estimated a TBI (hospitalised and fatal) incidence of 235 per 100,000 per year and a case fatality rate of 11 per 100. Each year in the USA, a total of 1.4 million people suffer a TBI, of whom an estimated 50,000 die and 235,000 are hospitalised (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>). Almost half of all TBI patients suffer long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Thornhill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornhill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitnall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitnall 2006</LINK>). This coupled with the fact that most TBI occurs in young adults further exacerbates the medical, social and financial burden. Furthermore, this burden is expected to grow, particularly in low and middle income countries, largely due to the predicted increase in RTCs and the associated TBIs.</P>
<P>There are two distinct phases of injury associated with TBI. Primary injury describes the irreversible, direct injury sustained at the moment of impact. Pathophysiological studies indicate that this primary injury initiates a sequence of mechanisms which cause further brain damage, known as secondary brain injury. The impact of secondary injury has been demonstrated by research in which it was found that approximately 40% of TBI patients who were able to speak or follow commands shortly after the event later died from their injury (<LINK REF="REF-Reilly-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reilly 1975</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-01-29 11:21:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The focus in minimising primary brain injury is placed on injury prevention interventions, whilst secondary brain injury requires effective therapeutic interventions to interrupt the mechanisms that can lead to further neural damage.</P>
<P>Secondary brain damage is caused by physiological assaults that result from a cascade of mechanisms which are initiated immediately after the time of the primary injury. Cerebral oedema is one of the physiological assaults contributing to secondary brain injury. There are two types of cerebral oedema, vasogenic and cytotoxic. Vasogenic oedema involves the accumulation of fluid within the brain that results from the opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), while cytotoxic oedema is due to sustained intracellular water collection (<LINK REF="REF-Unterberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unterberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vasogenic cerebral oedema is thought to be, in part, caused by a sequence of events that begins with the release of kinins, products of the kinin-kallikrein system (<LINK REF="REF-Francel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayhan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayhan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unterberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unterberg 1991</LINK>). These kinins stimulate a number of neurochemical disturbances which are thought to initiate and potentiate cerebral oedema (<LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 2005</LINK>). In particular, bradykinin (BK) is believed to contribute to the breakdown of the endothelial junctions that comprise the BBB, which enables the movement of substances into the brain and leads to an accumulation of fluid, that is causing vasogenic cerebral oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Unterberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unterberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unterberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unterberg 2004</LINK>). This is thought to further increase intracranial pressure, which can lead to cerebral ischaemia and additional structural neural damage (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In consideration of the role of kinins in vasogenic oedema and their contribution to secondary brain injury, the use of beta-2 receptor antagonists has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Francel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 1999</LINK>). These agents act to block the activity of the kinin-kallikrein system, thus preventing the production of kinins and their impact on the BBB. In this way it is hypothesised that the administration of bradykinin beta-2 antagonists can prevent elevation of intracranial pressure. There are promising results for the effects of beta-2 receptor antagonists on neurological function and brain oedema from studies in animal models of TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Ivashkova-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivashkova 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplanski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplanski 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stover-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stover 2000</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-29 11:22:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no reliable evidence that bradykinin beta-2 receptor antagonists are effective or safe for use in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Whilst the pooled effect estimates show non-significant reductions in mortality and severe disability with beta-2 receptor antagonists, they also indicate a non-significant increase in serious adverse events. However, all of these findings are consistent with the play of chance.</P>
<P>These findings are based on four RCTs involving 406 TBI patients.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-16 15:19:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two of the included studies were judged to have adequate allocation concealment, for the remaining two studies this was rated as unclear. Blinding of outcome assessors was unclear in the two trials that collected long-term GOS disability data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 1999</LINK> originally aimed to recruit 160 patients, 80 in each study arm, however the sponsor (SmithKline Beecham) stopped recruitment at 139 patients. The reason for this action was reported as being "because of results of animal toxicology studies conducted during the course of the trial. These results, although largely inconclusive after repeat studies were performed, were sufficient to prompt SmithKline Beecham to terminate the trial". Although 139 patients were enrolled, data were only presented for 133 and the reason for the exclusion of six patients was not given. For outcomes at six months, data were presented for 116 participants (58 in each group), thus a total of 17 (13%) patients were not included in the analysis. The reasons for these exclusions were not explicit in the trial report.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-BRAIN-2009" TYPE="STUDY">BRAIN 2009</LINK> was a well conducted trial, judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains. The trialists originally planned to recruit 400 patients however recruitment was stopped by the sponsor at 228 participants, consequently the trial's power to detect an effect was reduced.</P>
<P>The small sample size is likely to be the reason for the uneven distribution in the severity of TBI noted in <LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 2005</LINK>. Based on GCS at baseline, patients allocated to the intervention group were more severely injured than patients in the control group. There were also dosage errors in administration of the study drug, which meant that the exact allocated dose was not given in some patients.</P>
<P>The length of time between injury and administration of the drug in the trials may be considered a potential weakness. The inflammatory process is understood to be initiated immediately after injury. It therefore may be reasonable to believe that a treatment aimed at interrupting this process needs to be administered as early as possible to maximise any beneficial effect. The shortest eligible time period adopted in the included trials was within eight hours of injury, used in both <LINK REF="STD-BRAIN-2009" TYPE="STUDY">BRAIN 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 2005</LINK>, which still may have meant that patients were treated with beta-2 receptor antagonists relatively late in the inflammatory process. Future trials might consider adopting a more restrictive eligibility criterion in terms of time since injury, in an attempt to administer the treatment as early as possible in the inflammatory process. However, any time period has to also be clinically feasible.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-01-29 11:03:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review addresses a focused research question and uses pre-defined inclusion criteria and methodology to select and appraise eligible studies.</P>
<P>As with all systematic reviews, the possibility of publication bias should be considered as a potential threat to validity. However, in light of our extensive and sensitive searching we believe that the risk of such a bias affecting the results is minimal.</P>
<P>For the mortality outcome we pooled the number of deaths at the end of the follow-up period in each trial. For <LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marmarou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marmarou 2005</LINK> this was six months, for <LINK REF="STD-BRAIN-2009" TYPE="STUDY">BRAIN 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Narotam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Narotam 1998</LINK> it was 15 and 14 days, respectively. Pooling data from such different lengths of follow up may be considered a potential weakness.</P>
