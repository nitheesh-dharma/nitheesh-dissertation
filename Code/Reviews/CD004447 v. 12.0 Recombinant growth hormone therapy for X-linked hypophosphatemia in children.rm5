<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Synthetic human growth hormone for treating X-linked hypophosphatemia (or Vitamin D resistant rickets) in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Standard treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia can heal rickets but does not always raise the level of phosphates in the blood or return growth levels to normal. It is unclear whether combining human growth hormone therapy with standard treatment improves the phosphate levels, growth rates and bone mineral density. Only one small trial with five children was included in this review. The human growth hormone treatment improved the z score for height and briefly increased the level of phosphates in the blood. However, we found no conclusive evidence that favours the use of human growth hormone treatment for this condition. There have not been enough trials of human growth hormone treatment for this condition and more research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-06-22 11:56:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Conventional treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia with oral phosphate and calcitriol can heal rickets, but it does not always raise serum phosphate concentrations significantly, nor does it always normalize linear growth. Some clinical trials suggest that combining recombinant human growth hormone therapy with conventional treatment improves growth velocity, phosphate retention, and bone mineral density, but some clinical trials suggest that it appears to aggravate the pre-existent disproportionate stature of such children.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether recombinant human growth hormone therapy for children with X-linked hypophosphatemia is associated with changes in longitudinal growth, mineral metabolism, endocrine function, renal function, bone mineral density, body proportions, and also with any adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-22 11:55:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-28 12:14:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-18 22:26:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-09-18 22:23:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is an inherited disorder of phosphate homeostasis (internal balance) characterized by disproportionate short stature, rickets and osteomalacia, hypophosphatemia, abnormal phosphate reabsorption and disturbance of vitamin D metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1995</LINK>). XLH is caused by mutations in genes, i.e. PHEX, which encodes a membrane-bound endopeptidase. PHEX is expressed in bones and teeth but not in kidney and efforts are underway to clarify how PHEX function relates to the mutant phenotype (<LINK REF="REF-Jan-de-Beur-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jan de Beur 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of XLH is based on a consistent medical history and physical examination, radiological evidence of rachitic disease, normal blood calcium levels, hypophosphatemia caused by selective renal phosphate wasting for which no other cause is found, a family history consistent with multigenerational occurrence of XLH, and demonstration of PHEX mutations (<LINK REF="REF-Dixon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 1998</LINK>); a significant number of sporadic cases (i.e. nonfamilial) appears to be due to <I>de novo</I> PHEX mutations.</P>
<P>Affected individuals have normal intelligence, but they can suffer significant limitations due to the short stature and bone deformities. Conventional treatment of XLH with oral phosphate and calcitriol can heal rickets, although it does not raise serum phosphate concentrations significantly, and it does not always normalize linear growth and many individuals fail to reach normal adult height (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1993</LINK>). Furthermore, the phosphate therapy is often limited by adverse gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, and so on) and often leads to the development of hyperparathyroidism, and the high doses of calcitriol can lead to hypercalciuria (abnormally high concentration of calcium in the urine) and nephrocalcinosis (an abnormal condition in which calcium salts are deposited in kidney) (<LINK REF="REF-Goodyer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodyer 1987</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-09-18 22:25:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Growth hormone increases glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow in people with hypothalamic growth hormone deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschberg 1988</LINK>) and it has been found to increase the rate of renal phosphate reabsorption in immature rats (<LINK REF="REF-Haramati-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haramati 1990</LINK>). Administration of growth hormone to hypophysectomized rats on a phosphate-restricted diet results in a significant increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels (<LINK REF="REF-Halloran-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halloran 1988</LINK>). In vivo recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment stimulates osteoblasts and activates bone remodelling (<LINK REF="REF-Brixen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brixen 1990</LINK>), which suggest that growth hormone therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of people with XLH. Some observations that administration of exogenous growth hormone increases renal phosphate reabsorption and calcitriol levels (<LINK REF="REF-Brixen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brixen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baroncelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baroncelli 2001</LINK>) have led to speculation regarding the role of growth hormone in phosphate homeostasis and the possible beneficial effects of growth hormone therapy in XLH. One study showed that height z score and growth velocity z score improved after 12 months of 0.08 milligram per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg/d) rhGH in children with XLH (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-09-18 22:25:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Combining rhGH with conventional treatment offers theoretical advantages in poorly growing children with XLH. It is suggested that rhGH improves growth velocity, phosphate retention, and bone mineral density, but some studies suggest that it appears to aggravate the pre-existent disproportionate stature of such children (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1995</LINK>). In addition, rhGH is expensive, with the lifetime incremental cost of treating one child ranging from £43,100 (US$67,700) to £53,400 (US$83,900) (<LINK REF="REF-Bryant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryant 2002</LINK>). In light of this it is important to evaluate it's effectiveness and adverse effects.</P>

<P>Each author used standard data acquisition forms to independently extract data.</P>
<P>We planned to group outcome data into those measured at baseline, 6, 12,18, 24 months and annually thereafter. If outcome data were recorded at other time periods consideration would have been given to examining those as well.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-06-15 13:01:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two authors (HY, FY) independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial and resolved any disagreements through discussion. We assessed methodological quality based on a method described by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and related this to a judgement on the risk of bias. We considered generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment to be adequate, inadequate, or unclear, which related to a low, high and unclear risk of bias respectively. We noted whether the participant, carer, or outcome assessor was blind to the intervention, if all three categories were blinded, we considered there to be a low risk of bias; if none of these were blinded, we considered there to be a high risk of bias; and if it was unclear if any of these were blinded, we considered there to be an unclear risk of bias. We assessed whether the authors analysed outcome data for all originally randomized participants regardless of whether they completed treatment or dropped out of the study subsequently. If there were no missing data or if all withdrawals were clearly described and equal across groups, we considered there to be a low risk of bias; if reasons for missing data were not described, or these were unevenly distributed across treatment groups, we considered there to be a high risk of bias; if insufficient information was supplied to make a decision, we considered there to be an unclear risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between review authors.</P>

<P>For future updates of the review, when we can enter data into a meta-analysis, for binary outcome measures, we aim to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies, (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls). For continuous outcomes, we plan to record either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation for each group. Then, where appropriate, we will calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-09-23 20:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The included study used a cross-over design. Ideally when conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over trials we would have liked to use the methods that are recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). However, due to restrictions on the data that were available from the papers, the only method that we would have been able to use would be to treat the cross-over trials as if they were parallel trials. Elbourne says that this approach will produce conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent. Since we believe the data will have been analysed more appropriately by the primary authors, we have reported the results that were obtained from the primary paper and not entered the data from the cross-over trial into <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>. For future updates of this review, when suitable data are available for inclusion, we will aim to use the most appropriate method available to analyse these data.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-09-18 22:42:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We plan to quantify the impact of statistical and clinical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This measure (I<SUP>2</SUP>) describes the percentage of total variation across studies that are due to heterogeneity rather than by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The values of I<SUP>2</SUP> lie between 0% and 100%, and a simplified categorization of heterogeneity that we plan to use is of low (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 25%), moderate (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 50%), and high (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 75%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). </P>

<P>Only one study met the predefined inclusion criteria and included five participants (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 1997</LINK>). This is a randomized, double-blind (both the participants and the physicians were blinded) cross-over study, performed throughout a 24-month period in five children with XLH (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 1997</LINK>). The participants were two male and three female children with an average age (mean (SE)) of 5.6 (1.4) years (range, 2.5 to 9.0 years) at the time of enrolment in the study, and each participant served as his or her own control. Participants were randomized to receive either placebo or rhGH for the first 12 months, after which the participants were crossed-over to the other arm of the study for an additional 12 months. No washout period was described. The effect of 12 months of rhGH therapy on height, mineral metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, hemoglobin, thyroid and parathyroid function, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, growth hormone, urinary calcium, phosphate, nephrocalcinosis, renal function, and bone density was compared with the effects of 12 months of placebo administration using the same parameters. The dose of rhGH was 0.08 mg/kg/d given daily by subcutaneous injection. The dose was adjusted every three months according to changes in body weight. The following data were reported in this study: changes in z score; TmP/GFR; fasting serum phosphate concentration after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of either placebo control or rhGH therapy; changes in bone width, mass, and density after 12 months of either placebo control or rhGH therapy; biochemical data immediately and after 12 months of either placebo or rhGH therapy including: GH, IGF-I, IGF-BP3, TSH, T4, T3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, urinary calcium to creatinine ratio, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion and osteocalcin.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-23 20:45:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Only one study met the inclusion criteria for this review, and that the total number of participants involved was very small. Although allocation concealment and the method of blinding were sufficiently reported, generation of the randomization sequence was not described in the study. On account of the fact that the included study only has five participants, the results reported should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>No significant side effects were observed during the study which lasted 24 months.</P>
<P>The results from our review demonstrated that little research on recombinant human growth hormone therapy for children with X-linked hypophosphatemia has been conducted to date and the data were limited.</P>
<P>We have been unable to perform a meta-analysis due to the lack of studies which met our predefined inclusion criteria. However, we look forward to being able to include results of more studies available in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>The included study was based in Texas, USA (<LINK REF="STD-Seikaly-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seikaly 1997</LINK>). The duration of the study was 24 months. All participants had a positive family history suggestive of X-linked mode of inheritance, and all participants were prepubertal at the time of enrolment in the study. It is unknown whether the results are compatible with other countries, ethnic groups, and different age groups.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The data are too few and of insufficient quality to provide recommendations for practice. Although the theory suggests that rhGH may be beneficial to people with XLH, clinical use of rhGH in children with XLH cannot be supported on the basis of the single included trial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There have not been sufficient randomized controlled trials of rhGH therapy in children with XLH. We were unable to find any conclusive evidence to show whether the use of rhGH therapy in children with XLH is associated with changes in longitudinal growth, mineral metabolism, endocrine, renal function, bone mineral density, body proportions, and also with any adverse effects. We need more multicentre, adequately-powered and well-designed RCTs to address these important issues.</P>
