<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-02 12:06:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Advanced breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Women with advanced breast cancer have an average survival of about 2 years, although some women may live for many years beyond this. Therefore, it is important to investigate different chemotherapy treatment options. Chemotherapy can improve survival for women with metastatic breast cancer, but it can also cause toxic side effects. Of interest is whether there is any benefit by adding additional chemotherapy drugs, particularly given the potential harm caused by more dose-intensive treatment. This review investigated the value of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen. We found that the addition of chemotherapy drug/s to a regimen caused greater shrinkage of the tumour seen with imaging but increased toxicity. There is insufficient evidence to determine if there is an impact on time to disease progression and overall survival.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-08-11 10:51:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (to August 2009) using the codes for "advanced breast cancer" and "chemotherapy". This review is an update of the original Cochrane Review (Issue 3, 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-08-11 10:53:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Randomised trials with a first line regimen of at least two chemotherapy drugs compared to the same regimen plus the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-08-11 10:54:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Two authors extracted data independently from published trials. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-11 10:41:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:05:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-24 17:25:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-11 11:08:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women, and the most common cause of cancer-related death in women. In 2002, there were 1.15 million new cases of breast cancer reported worldwide. In the same year, there were approximately 410,712 deaths as a result of breast cancer; with an age-standardised death rate (ASR) of 13.2 (per 100,000). ASRs of 25 or greater were recorded in 2002 by Barbados (25.53), Belgium (27.7), Botswana (25), Cyprus (29.6), Denmark (27.8), Ireland (25.5), Malta (29.6), Philippines (27.1) and the Netherlands (27.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>While treatable, metastatic breast cancer is rarely curable at present. Some women with metastatic breast cancer live for many years; however, the median survival ranges from 18 to 24 months (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK>). Chemotherapy is considered by many to be the appropriate first treatment option for women with multiple sites of recurrence, or in women whose cancer is hormone refractory, or expected to be hormone resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Esteva-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteva 2001</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a list of chemotherapeutic agents and their site of action.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-11 11:05:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Most chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer show a steep dose-response curve. This has led to the conclusion that increasing the intensity of treatment will result in an increase in the rate and duration of response, and hence to improvements in survival (<LINK REF="REF-Hryniuk-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hryniuk 1987</LINK>). One widely accepted theory is that combining chemotherapy agents will produce regimens that are more active, thereby improving tumour response and overall survival.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-11 11:06:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The concurrent addition of a drug to a chemotherapy regimen is one method used to increase the dose and intensity of treatment. In the management of metastatic disease, it is important to understand if combination therapy offers a survival advantage over other treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2005</LINK>). Of interest is whether there is any benefit to increasing the dose intensity of a regimen, particularly given the potential harm caused by more dose-intensive treatment. If palliation is the primary goal of treatment, and anticipated survival is limited, then toxicity and quality of life become important factors when deciding on a treatment regimen.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-08-24 17:25:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review expands further on the potential benefit, or lack thereof, of the addition of a drug to a regimen containing two or more drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. Single agent versus combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Carrick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrick 2005</LINK>) is one such review in this series and this review of the addition of a drug to a regimen further complements these results. Compared with single-chemotherapy agents, combination regimens show a statistically significant advantage for tumour response and time to progression in women with metastatic breast cancer, a modest improvement in overall survival and significantly worse toxicities (<LINK REF="REF-Carrick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrick 2005</LINK>). This updated review examines the potential benefit, or lack thereof, of the addition of a drug to a regimen, by comparing regimens that contain at least two chemotherapy drugs, in comparison to that same regimen with the concurrent addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. We considered all chemotherapy agents regardless of their mechanism of action including antimetabolites, spindle poisons and agents that damage the DNA template.</P>
<P>There is a clear need to summarise the current research and to determine if the addition of one or more drugs to the regimen provides a survival benefit to aid decision making when choice of chemotherapy regimen is being considered for a woman with metastatic breast cancer.</P>

If not reported, we obtained these data indirectly using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> et al, either using other available summary statistics or from data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves. </P>
<P>The pooled HR from the derived observed (O)-expected (E) number of events and the variance for each trial using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). The pooled HR represents the overall risk of an event on chemotherapy regimens with the addition of a drug versus control regimens (non-addition of a drug). We used Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests to test for heterogeneity of trials (see the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions<I> </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables (complete or partial versus stable disease or no response) and derived a pooled relative risk. As trialists generally report response for both randomised and assessable patients, we have done the same in this review.</P>
<P>We extracted toxicity data and added up the total number of WHO grade III or IV events and number at risk across trials. We used these data to calculate a crude odds ratio (OR) (with 95% confidence intervals). Five trials did not utilise the WHO toxicity criteria, defining toxicity only as 'severe'. We decided to assume that trials which used the definition 'severe' assessed toxicity in the same manner as trials with toxicity WHO grade III or IV. We have, therefore, reported these toxicity data for WHO grade III and IV alone, and toxicity defined as 'severe' alone, and then all together as combined results. Following publication of the protocol and prior to data extraction, we decided to extract the total number of toxic events for leukopenia, nausea or vomiting and alopecia (hair loss) (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group on 16 March 2009, with an updated search on 10 August 2009. Of the 9426 references included in the register, 1143 were coded as references to studies of chemotherapy and advanced breast cancer (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Of these, 402 were references that reported the comparison of two different chemotherapy combinations in metastatic breast cancer, of which 360 were not eligible for this review based on information in the abstract. We obtained the complete paper for 42 references; this led to the exclusion of a further 19 references, which we considered ineligible for the review (see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The remaining 23 references reported the results of 17 randomised trials; six of these references were the preliminary data of a trial that was later fully published and included in this review. The 17 eligible trials reported on 22 treatment comparisons summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. The trials included in the forest plots were labelled by primary author and date of publication.</P>
<P>Where a trial included more than one comparison we labelled these alphabetically (a, b, c).

In 3-arm trials (e.g. drugs CMFD versus CMF versus CMFV), comparisons of interest were arm 1 versus arm 2 for addition of drug D and arm 2 versus arm 3 for addition of drug V. To avoid double counting of patients in arm 2, the number of included patients in that arm was halved and the proportion with the outcome of interest was assumed to be the same in each half as that observed in the whole group. The exception to this method was for the <LINK REF="STD-Ahmann-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmann 1976a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahmann-1976b" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmann 1976b</LINK> paper.

<B>Addition of one or more drugs to a regimen - all trials</B>
<BR/>The 17 trials (22 treatment comparisons) included in this review randomised 2674 women. Time-to-event data were extractable for overall survival from 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons, 79% of all patients randomised) and progression-free survival from four trials (six treatment comparisons, 34% of all patients randomised).

<B>Overall survival - all trials</B>
</I>
<BR/>There were 1532 deaths in 2116* randomised women, we found no detectable difference in overall survival between the addition of one or more drugs to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). The overall HR was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and we found no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.89, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.1).<BR/>*<I>There is conflicting information in Nemoto 1982, it is clearly stated that all 126 patients have been included in survival analysis, however, the graph displays N = 120.

</I>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Time to progression - all trials</B>
</I>
<BR/>We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.83, I<SUP>2</SUP>

<B>Toxicity - all trials</B>
</I>
<BR/>Treatment-related deaths were reported in three per cent of participants across the four trials (five treatment comparisons reporting on this outcome) (Forest plot 4.1). Of the 27 treatment-related deaths reported, eight occurred in the addition of a drug arm and eight occurred in the control arm, (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.69, P = 0.96). It was not possible to identify the treatment arm for an additional 11 toxicity-related deaths.</P>
<P>Toxicity data were not reported consistently across the included trials. Of the 17 eligible trials, 10 provided extractable data on grade III or IV toxicity. Of these (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>), seven trials reported on leucopenia (1011 patients), four on hair loss (340 patients) and eight on nausea and vomiting (1119 patients). Overall, addition of a drug to a regimen appeared to be associated with increased likelihood of leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 2000 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/litre) (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.95), severe nausea and vomiting (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.46) and hair loss (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.83 to 4.44) in assessable patients.</P>
<P>Quality of life data were not reported in any of the included studies in this review.</P>

<B>Sensitivity analysis: First line trials<BR/>

<BR/>
<I>Overall survival - first line trials</I>
<BR/>
</B>First line trials documented 840 deaths in 1229 randomised women. A statistically significant difference in survival was not evident between addition of one or more drugs to the regimen and control, with an overall HR of 0.95 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.09, P = 0.46) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.69, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.2).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Time to progression - first line trials</B>

<BR/>There were three trials (four treatment comparisons) that reported treatment-related deaths. Of the 14 treatment-related deaths reported, seven occurred in the addition of a drug arm and seven occurred in the control arm, (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.75, P = 0.98) (Forest plot 4.2).</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis revealed that the results are consistent, both for all trials and for the sensitivity analysis which looks at first line trials only. Therefore, the analyses by subgroup is based on all included trials (17 trials; 22 treatment comparisons; 2674 randomised women).</P>
<P>
<B>Addition of a 'less active' versus 'more active' drug</B>
<BR/>We conducted this pre-specified subgroup analysis to investigate the treatment effect with the addition of a drug/s now considered less active (vincristine, dibromodulcitol and ICRF-159) compared to the addition of drug/s considered more active (e.g. doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil). The addition of less active drug/s was investigated in five trials (seven treatment comparisons, 1086 patients), four of which reported survival outcomes. The addition of more active drug/s was considered in 12 trials (14 treatment comparisons, 1524 patients).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Overall survival - 'less active' versus 'more active'</B>
</I>
<BR/>There were 653 deaths observed in 837 women randomised to trials where the additional drug to a regimen was a less active drug and time-to-event outcomes were reported. There was no detectable difference in overall survival between addition of a less active drug regimen and control, with a HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.10, P = 0.47) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.55, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.3).</P>
<P>Data from the eight trials (nine treatment comparisons) where the additional drug was more active, and where time-to-event outcomes were reported, revealed no detectable difference in overall survival (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12, P = 0.75) and no significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.85, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.3).</P>
<P>A test for interaction between the two groups for overall survival revealed no significant interaction (P = 0.73).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Overall tumour response - 'less active' versus 'more active'</B>
</I>
<BR/>Addition of a less active drug to the regimen did not have a significant effect on overall tumour response in comparison to control (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.43, P = 0.86), with no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.11, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 44%) (Forest plot 3.3).</P>
<P>In comparison, the addition of a more active agent provided a significantly positive effect on overall tumour response (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.65, P = 0.006). Heterogeneity was statistically significant for this outcome across the trials (P heterogeneity = 0.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43%) (Forest plot 3.3).</P>
<P>A test for interaction between the two groups for overall response revealed no significant interaction (P = 0.21).</P>
<P>Due to the small number of trials that reported time to progression and toxicity data in this subgroup, we did not complete this analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Dose adjustment present in the addition of a drug arm versus no dose adjustment</B>
<BR/>This pre-specified subgroup analysis investigated Regimen A versus Regimen A (same dose) plus additional cytotoxic drug/s, and also Regimen A versus Regimen A (lesser dose) plus addition cytotoxic drug/s. Dose adjustment in the addition of a drug arm occurred in nine trials (12 treatment comparisons, 1483 patients), seven of which (nine treatment comparisons) reported survival outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Overall survival - dose adjustment versus no dose adjustment</B>
</I>
<BR/>There were 982 deaths observed in 1401 randomised women in trials with adjustment of dose in the addition of a drug arm. No detectable difference in survival was observed in these patients, with an overall HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.07, P = 0.36) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.86, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.4).</P>
<P>There were 550 deaths in 715 women randomised in trials which did not adjust the dose of the agents in the addition of a drug arm. Similarly, no detectable difference in survival was observed in these patients in comparison to control (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18, P = 1.00) with no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.56, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.4).</P>
<P>A test for interaction between the two groups for overall survival revealed no significant interaction (P = 0.58).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
<B>Overall tumour response - dose adjustment versus no dose adjustment</B>
</I>
<BR/>When the dose of a regimen was adjusted with the addition of a cytotoxic drug/s, a conventionally significant effect on overall tumour response was demonstrated (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.58, P = 0.04), with no significant heterogeneity observed (P heterogeneity = 0.13, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33%) (Forest plot 3.4).</P>
<P>In comparison, when no dose adjustment was present, no detectable effect on overall tumour response was observed (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50, P = 0.54), however, significant heterogeneity was observed for this outcome across the trials (P heterogeneity = 0.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 50%) (Forest plot 3.4).</P>
<P>A test for interaction between the two groups for overall response revealed no significant interaction (P = 0.46).</P>
<P>Toxicity and time to progression analysis was not appropriate due to the small number of trials that reported these outcomes in this subgroup.</P>
<P>
<B>Addition of an anthracycline versus addition of a non-anthracycline</B>
<BR/>We conducted post hoc subgroup analyses to investigate the treatment effect with the addition of an anthracycline. The addition of an anthracycline was investigated in five trials (352 patients), three of which reported survival outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Overall survival - addition of an anthracycline</B>
</I>
<BR/>There were 144 deaths observed in 193 women randomised to 3 of the 5 trials where the addition of a drug/s included an anthracycline and time-to-event outcomes were reported. There was no detectable difference in overall survival between anthracycline-containing regimens and control (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.24, P = 0.44) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.63, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.5).</P>
<P>Data from the 10 trials (11 treatment comparisons) where the drug added was a non-anthracycline and where time-to-event data was reported, revealed no detectable difference in overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08, P = 0.60) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.82, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (Forest plot 1.5).</P>
<P>A test for interaction between the two groups for overall survival revealed no significant interaction (P = 0.55).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Overall tumour response - addition of an anthracycline</B>
</I>
<BR/>Addition of an anthracycline drug to a regimen had a significantly positive effect on overall tumour response in comparison to control (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.86, P = 0.004). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (P heterogeneity = 0.15, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 41.0% (Forest plot 3.5).</P>
<P>In comparison, the addition of a non-anthracycline did not have a statistically significant effect on overall tumour response (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.37, P = 0.20) with no significant heterogeneity observed for this outcome across the trials (P heterogeneity = 0.06, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39%) (Forest plot 3.5).</P>
<P>A test for interaction for overall tumour response reveals significant interaction (P = 0.04). This suggests that the addition of an anthracycline has a greater effect on tumour response in those trials randomising patients to addition of an anthracycline to the regimen, in comparison to randomising patients to the addition of a non-anthracycline.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 12:05:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review did not find a statistically significant benefit in overall survival or time to progression for the addition of one or more drugs to the regimen over control (that is, the regimen alone) in the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</P>
<P>Despite the lack of evidence of a survival or time to progression benefit, this review demonstrated that addition of one or more drugs to the regimen provided a statistically significant advantage in tumour response compared to control. All eligible trials provided response data for 2101 assessable patients, for an OR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04). The favourable effect on response was consistent and statistically significant in regimens where an anthracycline was used as an additional agent (five treatment comparisons; 352 patients) which is consistent with an earlier review of 33 trials (5284 patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2004</LINK>). This favourable effect on response was also observed in exploratory subgroup analysis with addition of a drug considered 'more active' (such as 5-fluorouracil and anthracyclines) (14 treatment comparisons; 1518 patients), dose adjustment in the addition of a drug arm (12 treatment comparisons, 1483 patients) and in trials that added just one agent to a regimen (16 comparisons, 1772 patients).</P>
<P>Such a benefit in response rate, however, comes at the cost of toxicity. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug.</P>
<P>This review includes 22 clinically diverse regimens, which differ in dose, activity and potency (e.g. the addition of vincristine versus the addition of doxorubicin). Despite this diversity, there is a significant benefit in overall response rates with the addition of drug/s to the regimen. We observed statistically significant heterogeneity for overall response of all trials (P heterogeneity = 0.04, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 40%). We also observed significant heterogeneity in other overall response subgroups; however, no heterogeneity was observed in any time-to-event and toxic related death data.</P>
<P>It must be noted that many of the trials included in this review are not recent, and, therefore, new drug groups such as the addition of a taxane to a regimen have not been explored in this review. We found no recent research matching the eligibility study criteria for this review. Such research has been considered, and the addition of a taxane to a single agent regimen was examined in <LINK REF="REF-Ghersi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghersi 2004</LINK> et al.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses lead to speculation about what type of drug may be beneficial in the addition of a drug regimen. The results of subgroup analysis suggest that adding a drug or drugs to a regimen produces a positive impact on tumour response. This may, in fact, be primarily due to the addition of an anthracycline, the addition of a more active drug and the addition of one drug only.</P>
<P>Addition of one or more drugs to a regimen does not have a positive impact on survival or time to response. If the addition of drugs to the regimen (such as those added) does not appear to benefit overall survival, the same clinical effect may potentially be achieved by administering three drugs all at once (A+B+C), as by administering them over time (A, then over time B, then over time C). The results of this review, however, do not answer this question with confidence. Furthermore, there is a lack of papers with quality of life and toxicity data. The results and limitations of this review demonstrate the necessity for further research in this field. This review will be updated as and when trials using current therapies are completed, at this stage the authors are not aware of such trials being conducted. More research is required in this area to fully understand the benefit, or lack thereof, of the addition of drugs to the regimen in order to understand the overall question of chemotherapy intensity for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Addition of one or more drugs to the regimen does not provide a survival benefit compared to control (the regimen alone), nor does addition of one or more drugs to the regimen have a positive impact on time to progression. The addition of a drug/s to the regimen does produce a benefit in overall response in comparison to control (the regimen alone), but this benefit needs to be considered against the increased risk of toxicity. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We did not examine sequential therapy and alternating therapy in this review. A review of trials which examine the addition of a drug in a sequential or alternating regimen in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer may provide further information as to the benefit of addition of one or more drugs to the regimen. </P>

Randomisation to chemoimmunotherapy ceased after an interim evaluation showed no benefit &amp; increased toxicity. Analysis was conducted using 395 evaluable patients (260/283 patients randomised to chemotherapy, 135/149 patients randomised to chemoimmunotherapy). Time-to-event data not extracted from published curves for inclusion in this review as unable to do so accurately to replicate reported study findings. Follow-up details not reported.
