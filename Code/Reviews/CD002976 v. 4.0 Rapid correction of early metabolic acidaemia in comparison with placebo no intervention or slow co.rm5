</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Metabolic or mixed (metabolic and respiratory) acidosis are commonly encountered problems in the low birth weight (LBW) infant after delivery, and they may contribute to mortality and morbidity. Lactic acid is the product of anaerobic metabolism which occurs with perinatal asphyxia and/or hypoxaemia occurring during or after birth. Causes for the lactic acidosis are multiple and include maternal, placental and fetal factors. </P>
<P>Following hypoxaemia, cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural responses occur which decrease oxygen demand and redistribute available oxygen to the brain, heart and adrenal glands. The consequences of these responses include vasoconstriction, inhibition of spinal reflexes, midbrain activation and increased sympathetic tone. A shift to the anaerobic metabolic pathway leads to an accumulation of lactic acid. The resulting acidaemia causes a right shift in the haemoglobin-O2 dissociation curve which further lowers blood oxygen content. Hypoxaemia and acidosis also contribute to a high pulmonary vascular resistance which results in a right to left shunt. Right to left shunts have been demonstrated in infants born with perinatal asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome. </P>
<P>Treatments for metabolic acidaemia include the use of alkalising agents such as sodium bicarbonate or tromethamine (THAM), and oxygen. The purported benefits of normalising the pH include a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, an increase in myocardial contractility, improved hemodynamic responses to resuscitation with epinephrine and oxygen, and increased survival (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preziosi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preziosi 1993</LINK>). However, evidence from randomised controlled studies in human infants does not support the use of sodium bicarbonate to improve mortality or incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage.</P>
<P>Several studies have raised doubt concerning the benefits of using alkalising agents during hypoxic lactic acidosis. Although sodium bicarbonate corrects metabolic acidosis, its administration can lead to a transient decrease in intra-myocardial pH, cardiac output and blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Graf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kette-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kette 1990</LINK>). The reason for this is that correction of metabolic acidosis with an alkalising agent such as bicarbonate depends on the removal of CO2 and only functions in an 'open' system (<LINK REF="REF-Ostrea-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostrea 1972</LINK>). This is according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:<BR/>H+ + HCO3- &lt;=&gt; H2O + CO2.</P>
<P>Small, stressed babies frequently accumulate CO2 secondary to respiratory failure (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 1975</LINK>). CO2 crosses the cellular membrane very quickly and thus leads to worsening of intracellular acidosis by shifting the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to the left. In addition to this, the administration of a hyperosmolar solution such as sodium bicarbonate causes changes in serum osmolality. The resulting fluid shift causes cells, including red blood cells, to lose water-increasing intracellular ionic strength (<LINK REF="REF-Ostrea-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostrea 1972</LINK>). Proteins then become stronger acids and generate additional acid by releasing protons (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 1987</LINK>). There is also evidence that especially rapid injection (five minutes or less) of hypertonic solutions of sodium bicarbonate or THAM may be harmful. Rapid injection may cause increases in intra-vascular volume and venous pressure with profound effects on the brain including haemorrhage or haemorrhagic infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Finberg-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finberg 1977</LINK>). On the other hand, studies have shown an association between metabolic acidosis and poor neurodevelopmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Skouteli-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skouteli 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The dilemma remains, therefore, of whether metabolic acidaemia in the first 24 hours of life in LBW infants should be corrected by rapid infusion of alkali. Our aim is to review the evidence concerning the use of rapid infusion (five minutes or less) of alkalising agents to treat early (first 24 hours) metabolic acidaemia in LBW infants.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective was to assess the short-term (such as improved oxygenation as measured by blood gas analysis, oxygen requirement, length of ventilation, intracranial haemorrhage and neonatal survival) and long-term (such as survival and neurodevelopmental outcome) effects of the rapid correction of early (first 24 hours) metabolic acidaemia in LBW (&lt;2500g birth weight) neonates. </P>
<P>The two comparisons therefore were:<BR/>1. rapid correction vs placebo or nothing<BR/>2. rapid vs slow correction</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Searches were undertaken of MEDLINE from February 2004 back to 1966 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004) using the following terms:<BR/>infant, newborn (explode) [MeSH heading], <BR/>acidosis [MeSH heading], acidaemia/acidemia [textwords], <BR/>sodium bicarbonate [MeSH heading],<BR/>THAM/tromethamine/Tris [textwords].</P>
<P>The title and abstract of each retrieved study was examined to assess eligibility. If there was uncertainty, the full paper was examined. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the trials were the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Neonatal Review Group. </P>
<P>Studies were assessed using the following key criteria: blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement. Data were extracted independently by the reviewers. Differences were resolved by discussion and consensus of the reviewers. If necessary, investigators were contacted for additional information or data. Weighted mean differences (and 95% confidence intervals) were to be reported for continuous variables such as duration of oxygen therapy. For categorical outcomes such as mortality, the relative risk (and 95% confidence intervals) and risk difference (and 95% confidence intervals) were to be reported. We were to use a fixed effect model for the meta-analysis.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Five studies using sodium bicarbonate or THAM for correction of acidosis in low birth weight infants were identified. None were found to meet the criteria for inclusion in this review. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK> randomised 20 infants with a birth weight of 1000-2500g to receive one of four different treatment combinations which consisted of limited/unlimited environmental oxygen, slow/rapid bicarbonate administration and assisted/self-ventilation. Neonates admitted for the study had to be hypoxaemic (pO2 &lt;=75 in 50% headbox oxygen) and acidaemic (pH&lt;=7.25 if under 4 hours of age but if older than 4 hours could be either. This study was excluded because the included babies had a mixed rather than a purely metabolic acidaemia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vliet-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vliet 1973</LINK> enrolled 50 newborn infants with severe respiratory distress (clinical signs and symptoms, typical chest x-ray and Pa O2&lt;100 in 90 to 100% environmental oxygen) to receive either sodium bicarbonate or THAM. Although acidaemia was not necessary to be enrolled in the study, mean pH was 7.16. Method of randomisation was not described. This study was excluded because of the unclear randomisation, enrolment of neonates with birth weights &gt;2500g and lack of acidaemia as an entry criteria for the study. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baum-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 1975</LINK> enrolled 19 neonates with severe respiratory distress into a non-randomised study to receive either a rapid (&lt;30 seconds ) THAM injection or one of three sodium bicarbonate treatments (injection over 30 seconds, 2 minutes or 5 minutes). Acidaemia was not an entry criterion. Other reasons for exclusion were non-randomisation and enrolment of neonates with birth weights &gt;2500g.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bland-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bland 1976</LINK> examined the effects of infusions of sodium bicarbonate over 5 to 10 minutes as compared with infusions of glucose or albumin in 51 hypoproteinaemic premature (&lt;37 weeks gestation) infants at risk of developing acidaemia. Acidaemia while present in the majority of infants was not an essential prerequisite for entry in this trial. This study was excluded because the infusion of sodium bicarbonate was longer than 5 minutes and because of the enrolment of newborn infants with birth weights &gt;2500g.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Corbet-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Corbet 1977</LINK> studied the effects of a slow infusion of sodium bicarbonate in 62 acidaemic premature neonates with birth weights &lt;1500g as compared with no treatment. Acidaemia while present in the majority of infants was not an essential prerequisite for entry in this trial. This study was excluded because it compared a slow infusion of sodium bicarbonate titrated to pH with no sodium bicarbonate. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There are no randomised controlled trials to support or refute the rapid correction of acidosis in LBW neonates with early metabolic acidosis. </P>
<P>We asked a very specific question about the use of rapid correction of metabolic acidosis, as opposed to slow or no correction, because of the concerns with regard to rapid infusion of alkalising agents, especially in LBW infants. Observational studies in human newborn infants have reported an association between intraventricular haemorrhage and rapid injection of alkalising agents (<LINK REF="REF-Finberg-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finberg 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1974</LINK>). This association is possibly due to the immediate effects of an injection of alkali such as hypernatremia, hyperosmolarity or alterations of cerebral blood flow. </P>
<P>Studies on the immediate effects of an injection of sodium bicarbonate with hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity include:<BR/>1. Simmons et al (<LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1974</LINK>) - a comparison of two different approaches to correction of metabolic acidosis in human newborn infants with sodium bicarbonate in a retrospective review. He found that intracranial haemorrhage was associated with hypernatremia (&gt;150 mEq/L) or excessive sodium administration (&gt;8 mEq/kg/d) in 81% of the cases. <BR/>2. Papile et al (<LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>), in an observational study on the effect of sodium bicarbonate administration on intraventricular haemorrhage in very low birth weight infants, found no association between the serum sodium concentrations or amount of intravenous sodium bicarbonate administered and the occurrence of intraventricular haemorrhage. However they did find an association between a rapid infusion rate as well as high osmolarity of sodium bicarbonate and intraventricular haemorrhage. <BR/>3. Finberg 1977 (<LINK REF="REF-Finberg-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finberg 1977</LINK>) also demonstrated that intraventricular haemorrhage is associated with the high concentration and rapid rate of infusion of sodium bicarbonate. </P>
<P>Others have investigated the immediate effects of an injection of sodium bicarbonate on cerebral blood flow. These include:<BR/>1. Lou et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lou-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lou 1978</LINK>), who found a reduction of cerebral blood flow in human infants of up to 87% after variable doses of sodium bicarbonate (between 1 and 8 mEq/kg). <BR/>2. Laptook (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 1985</LINK>), who examined the effects of a moderate dose of sodium bicarbonate (2 mEq/kg infused over 3 minutes) on cerebral blood flow in a model using 1 day old piglets. He found no effect of sodium bicarbonate on cerebral blood flow or oxygen delivery if administered after hypoxia and acidaemia - however the dose used did not result in any alteration in osmolality or serum sodium concentrations. </P>
<P>Furthermore, other animal studies suggest there are other adverse effects with the correction of acidosis with alkalising agents that may be harmful to the LBW infant. <BR/>1. Steichen and Kleinman (<LINK REF="REF-Steichen-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steichen 1977</LINK>) found that an infusion of sodium bicarbonate (2 mEq/kg infused over 3 minutes), in newborn dogs with fixed ventilation, increased serum osmolality and PaCO2.<BR/>2. Graf et al (<LINK REF="REF-Graf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 1985</LINK>) showed that treatment of hypoxic lactic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in dogs decreased cardiac output and blood pressure (Graf 1985).<BR/>3. Bureau et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bureau-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bureau 1980</LINK>) showed that correction of metabolic acidosis worsened cerebral hypoxia and cerebral acidaemia in dogs (Bureau 1980). </P>
<P>The other agent used to correct metabolic acidosis, THAM, also has concerns with regard to its use in sick LBW infants. THAM can cause depression of ventilation and hypoglycaemia, and delivers an even greater osmolar load than sodium bicarbonate (<LINK REF="REF-Heird-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are only two randomised controlled trials where alkali has been compared with placebo or no treatment in human infants who are acidaemic or at risk of acidaemia. A randomised trial by Corbet et al (<LINK REF="STD-Corbet-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Corbet 1977</LINK>) comparing slow correction of acidaemia with no correction in preterm infants showed no benefit in terms of the rate of pH-correction, mortality or incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage. Bland et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bland-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bland 1976</LINK>) performed a randomised controlled trial comparing two doses of sodium bicarbonate with albumin or dextrose-water infused over 5-10 minutes in infants at risk of acidaemia (hypoproteinaemic and less than 37 weeks gestation) within two hours of birth - there were no differences in mortality, intracranial haemorrhage or the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. There was a trend to increased mortality and incidence of intracranial haemorrhage in the groups treated with sodium bicarbonate. There seems to be little available evidence supporting the correction of metabolic acidaemia by any means. <BR/> <BR/>Because the effects of rapid injection of alkali, described above, can have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcome these worrisome reports should lead the clinician to caution. In the absence of any evidence of benefit from the rapid injection of alkali it would be difficult to justify its use in LBW infants with metabolic acidosis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence available from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the rapid correction of metabolic acidosis, in LBW infants with metabolic acidosis in the first 24 hours of life, as compared with slow or no correction. <BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>If rapid correction is thought to be a useful treatment in the correction of metabolic acidaemia then there is a need for studies, with a larger number of infants, to clarify whether there is any benefit from this treatment without significant harm. However, given the lack of evidence that any correction of metabolic acidaemia confers significant benefit without harm, it would probably be prudent to investigate whether any correction of metabolic acidaemia is beneficial before studying rapid correction. Any studies investigating the use of alkalising agents should include important clinical outcomes such as ventilatory parameters, mortality, IVH/PVL and neurodevelopmental outcome. Despite the apparent lack of benefit or detriment of rapid correction of metabolic acidosis, the potential hazards of this therapy should be appreciated. As caution is warranted as to the possibility of intraventricular bleeding after rapid injection of alkalising agents, this question may best be answered in animal studies first.</P>
