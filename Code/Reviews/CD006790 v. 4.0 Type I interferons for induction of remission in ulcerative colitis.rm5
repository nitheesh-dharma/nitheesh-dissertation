<P>
<B>What is ulcerative colitis?</B>
</P>
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a need to hurry to the toilet to pass feces (fecal urgency).</P>
<P>
<B>What are type I interferons?</B>
</P>
<P>Interferons (IFNs) are drugs that regulate the immune system and have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic inflammatory disorders. People with UC who are experiencing disease symptoms have &#8216;active&#8217; disease, periods when the symptoms stop are called &#8216;remission&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers investigated whether type I IFNs results in remission in people with active ulcerative colitis, and whether it causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to August 8, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers identified six studies that included a total of 517 participants. Five studies (total 485 participants) compared type I IFNs to placebo (fake medicine) injections. One small (32 participants) low quality study compared types I IFNs to prednisolone (a steroid drug) enemas. This study did not measure remission and found no difference between the treatment groups in quality of life or disease activity scores. There was no difference between type I interferons and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who achieved remission or improvement of their symptoms. These results suggest that type I IFNs do not produce remission from ulcerative colitis. Common side effects included headaches, arthralgias (joint pain), myalgias (muscle pain), fatigue, back pain, nausea, injection site reactions, rigors (cold and shivering), and fevers.</P>
<P>At present, the results from medical trials do not support the use of type I IFNs for the production of remission in active ulcerative colitis.</P>

<P>Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines which possess immunoregulatory properties and have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic inflammatory disorders.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-02 08:13:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialised register, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to August 8, 2014. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings were manually searched.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of type I IFNs for induction of remission in UC were included. The study population included patients of any age with active ulcerative colitis. There were no exclusions based on type, dose or duration of IFN treatment. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-02 08:14:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two independent authors reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was induction of remission of ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in disease activity index score, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, and adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval for continuous outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-03 10:10:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Six studies were eligible for inclusion (517 patients). Five studies compared type I IFNs to placebo injections (485 patients) and a single study compared IFNs to prednisolone enemas in patients with left-sided colitis (32 patients). The active comparator study was rated as high risk of bias due to an open-label design. Three studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Two studies described as double blind were rated as unclear risk of bias for blinding. There was no significant benefit of type I IFNs over placebo for inducing clinical remission or improvement in patients with active ulcerative colitis. Thirty-six per cent (87/242) of patients in the type I IFNs group achieved clinical remission by 8 to 12 weeks compared to 30% (36/120) of placebo patients (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.58; 4 studies, 362 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcome clinical remission was moderate due to sparse data (123 events). Fifty-six per cent (149/264) of patients in the type I IFNs group improved clinically by 8 to 12 weeks compared to 48% (77/161) of placebo patients (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.40; 4 studies, 425 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcome clinical improvement was moderate due to sparse data (226 events). Patients who received type I IFNs were significantly more likely to withdraw from the studies due to adverse events than those who received placebo. Seven per cent (18/42) of type I IFNs patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% (3/152) of placebo patients (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 9.40). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcome withdrawal due to adverse events was low due to very sparse data (21 events). The study comparing type I IFNs to prednisolone enemas found no difference between the treatment groups in quality of life or disease activity scores. Common adverse events included headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, back pain, nausea, application site reactions, rigors, and fevers. There were no statistically significant differences in the other secondary outcomes.</P>

<P>
<B>Ulcerative colitis<BR/>
</B>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic or recurrent contiguous inflammation of the colonic mucosa resulting in symptoms such as bloody diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, urgency and tenesmus. Inflammation typically arises in the distal colon and extends in a proximal direction. The disease can be subcategorised by anatomic extent. Left sided colitis is defined by inflammation that does not extend beyond the splenic flexure, and pancolitis where there is more proximal involvement. UC varies in severity and patients often experience cycles of relapses and remissions. While the exact cause of the disorder remains to be determined, environmental factors are thought to modify disease presentation in genetically predisposed individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Ek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ek 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2006</LINK>). From an immunological perspective, the naive T cells (Th0) preferentially differentiate into Th2 (T-helper) lymphocytes, which express a predominant interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13 cytokine profile (<LINK REF="REF-Geremia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geremia 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bouma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 2003</LINK>). However, UC represents an 'atypical' Th2 disease as increased circulating levels of interferon-&#947; and TNF-&#945; (tumour necrosis factor-&#945;) have also been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Tsukada-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsukada 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jovanovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jovanovic 2014</LINK>). It is hypothesized that this imbalance in circulating pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines underlies the chronic disease state (<LINK REF="REF-Geremia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geremia 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baumgart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgart 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The mainstay of UC treatment comprises anti-inflammatory agents in the form of 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2006</LINK>), glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>), immunosuppressives (<LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2012</LINK>), and more recently monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#593;) (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>) and integrin &#593;4ß7 (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2013</LINK>). These standard medical therapeutic options vary in efficacy, and importantly, toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2015</LINK>). While surgery may be considered 'curative' by some, this is often not ideal, rendering some patients with permanent ostomies and others with ongoing symptomatology, including that associated with suboptimal ileoanal pouch function. Therefore, alternative treatments are continually being evaluated.</P>
<P>
<B>Interferons<BR/>
</B>Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines which may be released in response to viruses, bacteria, parasites and tumour cells. Interferons possess immunoregulatory, antiviral and anti-cancer properties (<LINK REF="REF-George-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2012</LINK>). IFNs have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic inflammatory disorders including multiple sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kasper-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasper 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2001</LINK>), and chronic viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 2006</LINK>). There are two main classes of IFNs: type I IFNs (which include &#945;, &#946;, &#949;, &#937;, &#954; isoforms) (<LINK REF="REF-Ivashkiv-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivashkiv 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludigs-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludigs 2012</LINK>), and type II IFNs (&#947; isoform) (<LINK REF="REF-Ghosh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghosh 2006</LINK>). More recently a new family of antiviral cytokines, the type III IFNs (&#955; isoform) has been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Durbin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durbin 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review will focus on the use of type I IFNs for the induction of remission of UC, specifically IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#946; which are marketed in standard recombinant or pegylated forms. IFN-&#945; has been shown to enhance human Th1 responses. This helps to re-establish the Th1/Th2 balance in Th2 predominant diseases by down-regulating Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (<LINK REF="REF-Shibuya-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibuya 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brassard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brassard 2002</LINK>). IFN-&#946; increases the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10, inhibits IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;, and enhances regulatory T lymphocyte and NK (natural killer) cell activity (<LINK REF="REF-Graber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graber 2007</LINK>). As IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#946; share a cellular surface receptor, they both induce IL-1Ra.</P>
<P>Initial interest in IFNs for UC arose from an incidental observation of a patient with known UC who experienced a dramatic improvement in his UC symptoms when he was treated with IFN-&#945;2a for concurrent chronic hepatitis B (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00fc_mer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sümer 1995</LINK>). This led to a small prospective open-label study by the same investigators in which 28 inpatients who had failed to respond to 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds and oral or topical corticosteroids were treated with IFN-&#945;2a therapy for 6 to 12 months. Eighty-two percent of patients responded to therapy within 15 days and were in complete clinical endoscopic remission after 6 months of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00fc_mer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sümer 1995</LINK>). Subsequently, <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2002</LINK> trialed IFN-&#946;-1a in 25 steroid refractory UC patients in an open label study. The decision to use IFN-&#946; rather than IFN-&#945; occurred in response to its clinical utility in the chronic inflammatory disorder, multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, in vitro studies had suggested that IFN-&#946;, in contrast to IFN-&#945; or IFN-&#947; did not enhance the production of inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid or leukotriene B4. A total of 88% of patients entered remission with a mean time to response of 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Musch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The adverse effect profile of IFNs includes flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, malaise, alopecia and arthralgias. Other potential adverse events include skin rashes, psychological disturbances, and perturbations in the haematological profile. IFNs may also induce autoimmune complications including thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus and alopecia (<LINK REF="REF-Borg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okanoue-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okanoue 1996</LINK>). Of concern, there have been isolated case reports documenting the association between IFNs and the induction of ischaemic colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Okanoue-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okanoue 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sparano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tada-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tada 1996</LINK>), and ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Tursi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tursi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprenger-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprenger 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mavrogiannis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavrogiannis 2001</LINK>). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Bargiggia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bargiggia 2005</LINK> conducted a case control study of IFN-&#945; therapy in patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and chronic active hepatitis C and determined that no patients developed an IBD relapse during IFN treatment or in the following 12 month follow-up. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate if IFN therapy results in improvement or detriment to patients with UC.</P>
<P>Commercially available type I IFNs have different pharmacokinetic profiles, and consequently there is variation in the frequency and mode of administration. IFNs can be administered on alternate days, thrice weekly, or once a week by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Some of the IFNs are available in pegylated forms to reduce clearance. Pegylation is the process by which the biologically inert polyethylene glycol chains are cross linked to the active moiety, in this case the IFN protein, to optimise overall pharmacokinetics (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2004</LINK>). Currently available type I IFNs include IFN &#945;-2a (Roferon A® - Roche), IFN &#945;-2b (Intron A® - Schering), pegylated IFN &#945;-2a (Pegasys® - Roche), pegylated IFN &#945;-2b (Pegatron® - Schering), IFN &#946;-1a (Rebif® - Pfizer, EMD Serono), IFN &#946;-1a (Avonex® - Biogen Idec), IFN &#946;-1a (CinnoVex® - CinnaGen, Fraunhofer Gessellschaff Institute), and IFN &#946;-1b (Betaseron® - Bayer HealthCare).</P>
<P>
<B>Importance of this review</B>
<BR/>In an effort to improve the management of UC, alternative therapeutic options need to be evaluated. Laboratory studies suggest that IFN treatment may attenuate chronic colitis. However, there is limited clinical information on the use of IFN therapy for UC, and there are concerns regarding its adverse effect profile. Furthermore, there is variation in the types of IFN (IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#946;), formulations (standard versus pegylated), doses and dosing schedules used in clinical practice. Therefore, a systematic review was planned to assess the role of type I IFN therapy for induction of remission in UC. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane systematic review (New Reference).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy of type I IFN therapy (including IFN-&#946;-1a, IFN-&#946;-1b, IFN-&#945;-2a, IFN-&#945;-2b and associated pegylated formulations) for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. The secondary objectives were to determine improvement in disease activity (including quality of life) and to evaluate adverse events associated with IFN therapy.</P>

<P>UC is usually diagnosed using a combination of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histologic criteria. Patients (both paediatric and adult) with active UC at the time of recruitment were included. It was anticipated that there would be heterogeneity in defining disease activity, therefore the definitions used by the authors of the primary studies were accepted. These included some of the following published disease activity indices: the Colitis Activity Index (CAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>), the Powell-Tuck Index (<LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Tuck-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Tuck 1978</LINK>), the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 1998</LINK>), Beattie's Colitis Symptom Score (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 1996</LINK>), Lichtiger Symptom Score for Acute Ulcerative Colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtiger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtiger 1990</LINK>), the Mayo Index (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>), the Seo Index (<LINK REF="REF-Seo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 1992</LINK>), the Truelove and Witt's Index (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>), Ulcerative Colitis Scoring System (UCSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>) and the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Study selection<BR/>
</B>All the article abstracts identified by the above search strategies were reviewed for eligibility. The full text articles of potentially relevant studies were independently reviewed by YW and JKM for inclusion in the review. Review articles were also retrieved and reference lists were manually searched. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Trials published in abstract form were only included if full details of the protocol and results could be obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection<BR/>
</B>The eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate (YW, JKM) and the results of the trials were abstracted onto specially designed data extraction forms which mandated the following information be recorded:</P>
<P>1. General article information: Study title, first author, and year of publication.<BR/>2. Study design: Randomisation process, allocation concealment, and blinding.<BR/>3. Patient cohort: Countries in which study was performed, years patients were entered into the study, total number of patients screened, total number of patients randomised, inclusion/exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics (demographics, disease extent, disease severity).<BR/>4. Intervention: Type of IFN (&#945; versus &#946;), formulation of IFN (standard versus pegylated), route of administration, dose, and dosing schedule.<BR/>5. Control: No treatment, placebo, or details of co-intervention.<BR/>6. Primary outcome: Proportion of patients achieving remission in the intervention and control groups. Where available, the median number of days to remission and the mean change in the disease activity index score will be recorded.<BR/>7. Secondary outcomes: Data on other clinical, histologic, endoscopic measures of disease activity; quality of life information; adverse events; withdrawal of participants from either the intervention or control group, where provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool involves rating trials as high, low or unclear risk of bias for each of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding;</LI>
<LI>Missing data and attrition;</LI>
<LI>Outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Outcome data are rated as being of high, moderate, low or very low quality evidence. Data from randomised controlled trials begin as high quality but can be downgraded based on the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk of bias in the included trials;</LI>
<LI>Indirect evidence;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistent findings (including unexplained heterogeneity);</LI>
<LI>Imprecision (i.e. sparse data or wide confidence interval or both); and</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The different quality ratings are interpreted as the likelihood that future research would affect the estimate of effect. An estimate of effect based on high quality evidence is unlikely to change with further research. If the overall evidence is of moderate quality further research may have an impact on our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate when the evidence is rated as low quality. Very low quality research indicates significant uncertainty with the findings (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>Measures of treatment effect<BR/>Data were extracted from the original studies and converted into individual 2 x 2 tables (e.g. remission versus no remission x IFN versus control) for each study. The proportion of patients who entered remission was calculated and reported as a relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) and risk difference (RD) was also calculated. This was determined using an intention-to-treat analysis, based on the total number of patients randomised to each of the two groups, and the number of patients in remission at the end of follow-up in each group. For continuous variables, the results were presented as the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI or the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used to measure the same underlying construct. Where available, individual 2 x 2 tables for strata within studies were also abstracted.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis<BR/>For pooled analyses we utilized a random-effects or fixed-effect model depending on clinical and statistical heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>The studies were first independently assessed for clinical or methodological heterogeneity. Then, the I<SUP>2</SUP> measure was calculated to quantify inconsistency. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance. We interpreted I<SUP>2</SUP> as follows: 25% - low heterogeneity, 50% - moderate heterogeneity, 75% - high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test was also calculated. Being a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a P-value &lt; 0.10 was considered to be statistically significant.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis<BR/>A priori subgroup analyses were planned for the different isoforms of type I IFN (IFN-&#945; versus IFN-&#946;), different formulations of IFN (standard versus pegylated), different doses, different durations of treatment, paediatric versus adult, and left-sided colitis versus pancolitis.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>We performed sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality studies and studies published in abstract form. There were insufficient eligible trials to construct a 'funnel plot' to assess publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analyses were performed using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3.5, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).</P>

<P>The initial search yielded 211 non-duplicated articles. Based on abstract review, all potential controlled trials and review articles were retrieved for full text review. A total of 29 full text manuscripts were obtained of which six randomised controlled trials (21 full-text articles) were identified by the authors as being eligible for inclusion (See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Eight studies were excluded.

<P>All six included studies (total of 517 patients) were conducted in adult patients aged 18 years and over. The studies can be differentiated by the comparison groups and formulation of interferon used. Five trials compared a type I IFN to placebo in patients with active UC of any anatomic extent (<LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>).

The remaining trial compared IFN-&#945;-2a to prednisolone enemas in patients with left sided UC (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK> was a multi-center phase II study in North America and Eastern Europe sponsored by Biogen Idec. This was a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of 123 adult patients who had active ulcerative colitis with a total Mayo score of 6 to 13 points including a Mayo endoscopic subscore of at least 2, indicating moderate to severe endoscopic activity, despite prior or concomitant treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to IFN&#946; 30 &#956;g intramuscularly twice a week for 12 weeks (n = 62), or placebo injections (n = 61). The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 8, defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score by 30% and at least a 3 point decrement, accompanied by a decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or an absolute endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. The secondary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of IFN&#946; and the percentage of subjects with a decrease in the SCCAI score of &#8805; 3 points at week eight.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> was conducted in Germany and the Czech Republic. This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 91 adult patients with steroid refractory, active UC defined by a CAI score of at least 8 points. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Patients in group one received three million international units (MIU) of IFN-&#946;-1a by subcutaneous injection three times a week (n = 32). Patients in group two received one MIU of IFN-&#946;-1a by subcutaneous injection three times a week (n = 30); and group three received placebo injections (n = 29). The total duration of treatment was eight weeks. The primary outcome was the response rate at the end of treatment. Response was defined as a reduction of six or more points on the CAI at week eight compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints included: the number of patients achieving a complete response (reduction of CAI to &#8804;4 points after 8 weeks of treatment); time until response; reduction of CAI after 4 and 8 weeks; reduction of the endoscopic index after 8 weeks; number of patients receiving colectomy; and reduction of steroid dose.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> compared the effects of IFN-&#946;-1a to placebo. The study was conducted in three countries; Belgium, Canada and Germany. This was a randomised, double blind, intra-individual, dose escalating trial of 17 adult patients with moderately active UC. This was defined by a UCSS score of 6 to 10, with a proctosigmoidoscopy score of 2. Patients were randomly assigned to IFN-&#946;-1a by subcutaneous injection three times a week (n = 10) or placebo injections (n = 7). Patients in the IFN-&#946;-1a group were started at 22 &#956;g three times a week by subcutaneous injection. Dose escalation was dependent on 'improvement'. Improvement was defined as a decrease of one point in the combined score of UCSS symptoms and physician's global assessment (PGA). If no improvement was observed after six injections, the dose was increased to 44 &#956;g three times a week. If no improvement was observed after six injections at the 44 &#956;g dose, this was increased further to 88 &#956;g three times a week. If improvement was observed after six injections at any dose, the patient entered a maintenance treatment phase of 6 to 12 injections at that dose. If no improvement was observed after six injections at 88 &#956;g, or if remission occurred at any point, treatment was stopped. The maximum duration of treatment was eight weeks, and the minimum duration was four weeks. The primary end point was efficacy, which was defined by treatment response and remission. Treatment response was defined by a decrease of at least three points from baseline in the UCSS symptoms score and PGA (without the proctosigmoidoscopic score) during treatment. Remission was defined as complete resolution of clinical symptoms (all clinical UCSS subscores equal to zero), with a proctosigmoidoscopy score of zero or one at any time during treatment. Secondary end points included overall treatment and end point responses (defined as a decrease in UCSS symptoms score, PGA, and proctosigmoidoscopic scores of at least one point during or at the end of treatment), and clinical end point responses (a decrease of at least one point from baseline in UCSS symptoms scores and PGA, without the proctosigmoidoscopic score). Safety data were also collected.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> was an European phase II clinical trial sponsored by EMD Serono. The study was randomised, multi-centred, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. The trial involved 194 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis, defined by a UCSS score between 6 and 10 with a UCSS PGA of less than three and a proctosigmoidoscopy score of two or three. Patients were randomised using stochastic minimization to one of three trial arms: IFN-&#946;-1a 44 &#956;g (n = 65), IFN-&#946;-1a 66 &#956;g (n = 65), or matching (same excipients but no IFN-&#946;-1a) placebo (n = 64). All study drugs were given by subcutaneous injection three times a week for eight weeks and there was a four week follow-up period.The primary objective was to identify the best dose of IFN-&#946;-1a for the induction of endoscopically confirmed remission and examine the safety profile of this dose. Safety, tolerability, quality of life and biological markers were also assessed as secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> compared the effects of pegylated IFN-&#945; (PegIFN) to placebo. The study was conducted in five university hospitals in four countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany and France. This was a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial of 60 adults with UC. Patients were randomly assigned to PegIFN 0.5 &#956;g/kg (n = 19); PegIFN 1.0 &#956;g/kg (n = 21); or placebo (n = 20). All therapies were administered by subcutaneous injection once a week, for a period of 12 weeks. Patients were eligible if they had evidence of clinical activity despite oral or topical 5-aminosalicylate maintenance therapy, stable doses of steroids or azathioprine. Active disease was defined by a CAI score of greater than six, and endoscopic activity was defined by a Rachmilewitz endoscopy score of greater than four. Clinical evaluation was performed before the start of treatment (day -8), then on days 0, +8, +15, +29, +43, +57, and at the end of treatment (day +85). Patients underwent sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy on days -1, +29, and +85. The primary outcome was safety. All adverse events were recorded and classified as serious or non-serious, and likely or unlikely to be related to treatment. Other outcomes included disease remission (defined as a CAI score of less than or equal to four), endoscopic remission (defined as a score of less than four), and histological activity (graded on a scale from zero to three). These markers of remission were measured at week 12. Changes in serological inflammatory indices including haemoglobin, white cell count, platelet count, C reactive protein, &#945;-1 acid glycoprotein, creatinine, liver function tests, and albumin were also recorded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK> compared the effects of IFN-&#945;-2a to prednisolone enemas. The study was conducted in Denmark. This was an open-label, randomised controlled trial of 32 adult patients. The patient cohort was restricted to those with active left-sided UC. Patients were randomly assigned to IFN-&#945;-2a therapy by subcutaneous injection three times a week (n = 16) for 12 weeks; or prednisolone enemas 100 mL (25 mg) daily for 30 consecutive days (n = 16). The dose of IFN used was 9 MIU for the first week, 6 MIU for the second week, and 3 MIU from weeks 3 to 12 inclusive. All patients were treated with sulfasalazine or mesalazine compounds with a median daily dose of 2.4 g (range 1.2 to 3.6 g), and were not allowed dose adjustments for at least four weeks before entry. The patients receiving enemas were evaluated after one week, two weeks and on completion of the trial; while the IFN-&#945;-2a group had appointments after one week, two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, and after completion of the trial. Clinical and endoscopic disease activity was graded at each visit by semi-quantitative scales. Clinical activity assessment was based on the patient filling out a five point symptom scale daily; while a physician evaluated abdominal tenderness, enquired about limitations in the patient's daily activities, adverse events and extraintestinal manifestations at each clinic visit. Endoscopic evaluation involved proctoscopy or colonoscopy at each clinic visit, and histological assessment of disease activity (rectal biopsies) were obtained at entry and after treatment. The combined clinical and endoscopic Powell-Tuck Index was also calculated. Secondary outcomes included an assessment of quality of life, and tolerability of treatment. Remission was not defined by the authors, rather, the change in the activity indices were measured. <B>

induction of remission of UC. Of the six studies satisfying the inclusion criteria, four studies reported on the proportion of patients achieving remission at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>).

<P>In the IFN-&#946;-1a dose escalating study by <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>, 30% (3/10) of the intervention group achieved remission compared to 0% in the placebo group. One patient received 44 &#956;g IFN-&#946;-1a injections whilst two were treated with 88 &#956;g IFN-&#946;-1a injections. The authors concluded that patients treated with escalating doses of IFN-&#946;-1a tended to show a higher remission rate than those in the placebo group, however, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> study clinical remission was achieved by 35.4% (23/65) of patients treated in the 44&#956;g IFN-&#946;-1a group, 27.7% (18/65) of those in the 66&#956;g IFN-&#946;-1a group, and 28.1% (18/64) of patients in the placebo group. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Please note, only percentages were reported in the original publication, absolute numbers in brackets were calculated using the intention to treat population.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> used a CAI of &#8804; 4 to define remission. At week 12, 7/21 (33.3%) of the 1.0 &#956;g/kg PegIFN-&#945; group, 9/19 (47.4%) of the 0.5 &#956;g/kg and 7/20 (35.0%) in the placebo group achieved remission. The authors concluded that there was no significant advantage of PegIFN over placebo.</P>
<P>Data from four studies were pooled in a meta-analysis. While three of the studies used IFN-&#946;-1a (<LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>), and one study used PegIFN-&#945; (<LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>), the authors felt there was sufficient clinical homogeneity across both IFN preparations in immunological action, such that the data could be meta-analysed. There was no statistically significant difference in remission rates between IFNs and placebo. Thirty-six per cent (87/242) of IFNs patients achieved remission compared to 30% (36/120) of placebo patients (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.58; P = 0.37). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting the outcome clinical remission was moderate due to sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, these results should be interpreted with caution given variability in dosing, treatment duration, and the timing of outcome assessment. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> documents the comparative doses of IFN-b-1a used in the <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> trials. A 44 &#956;g dose is approximately equivalent to 12 MIU (<LINK REF="REF-Antonetti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonetti 2002</LINK>). Although the <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> trial suggested that remission may be dose dependent, the dosing was still lower than that used in the <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> trial preventing comparisons of high versus low dose IFN across studies. The comparison was further confounded by differing durations of treatment; 8 weeks (56 days) in the <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> trials compared to approximately 5 weeks (35.5 days) in the <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> study.</P>
<P>A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were planned for the different IFN isoforms and according to study quality. The analysis was repeated excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> study as patients were treated with the &#945;&#8722;isoform preparation and this was the only study that was judged to be low quality.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> reported the median change in CAI at four and eight weeks. All patients started with a CAI score of 10; at 4 weeks, there was a reduction of 5 points in the CAI in the 3 MIU group, 3 points in the 1 MIU group, and 4 points in the placebo group. The median change in CAI at eight weeks was six points in the 3 MIU group, three points in the 1 MIU group, and four points in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups at either time point. <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> measured the CAI at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12.

<B>4. Improvement in quality of life</B>
</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK> used the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) to assess quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1989</LINK>). The following results represent an ITT analysis in patients with disease extension exceeding the rectum. The IBDQ has not been validated in patients with proctitis alone.

<B>5. Adverse events </B>
</I>
<BR/>
a. Adverse eventsThe most common adverse events experienced by patients were consistent with the known side effect profile of IFNs and included headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, back pain, nausea, application site reactions, rigors, and fevers. The adverse event profile of the different isoforms of IFN appeared similar. It was not possible to meta-analyse these adverse events due to variability in reporting. For example, a large number of patients experienced adverse events in the <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> study, 100% of patients experienced at least one adverse event and 97% of these events were graded as mild or moderate in severity. In the <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> trial, 68.1% of patients experienced adverse events. However adverse events were not reported according to treatment allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> tabulated all adverse events but did not report them per patient. There were 13 adverse effects in the placebo group, 47 in the PegIFN 0.5 mg/kg group, and 45 in the PegIFN 1.0 mg/kg group. <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK> reported that adverse events only occurred in the IFNs group. A table of adverse events was provided on a time line, using a semi-quantitative scale. However, this does not allow one to determine the total number of patients suffering an adverse event and the tolerability of treatment was assessed by the patient rather than the physician. The largest number of adverse events was reported during week one, where 35 events were reported by an undisclosed number of patients in the IFN-a-2a group. The authors commented that the adverse events were generally mild to moderate with the most common being flu-like symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK> reported that 84% (52/62) of the IFN-&#946;-1a group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 57% (35/61) of placebo patients. A more detailed breakdown of the adverse events is reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> listed common (&gt;10% of patients) and less common (&lt;10% of patients) adverse events and tabulated data for some mild to moderate adverse effects (e.g. headache, fever, influenza-like symptoms, and application-site disorders) and serious adverse effects.</P>
<P>Serious adverse events were more clearly documented. <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> reported 7 serious adverse events in 5 patients; 1/32 (3.1%) in the 3 MIU IFN-&#946;-1a group experienced chest pain while 4/29 (13.8%) in the placebo group experienced a variety of adverse events including worsening UC symptoms, infection, and a respiratory disorder. There were no serious adverse events documented in the 1 MIU IFN group. <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> reported that 3/21 (14.3%) in the 1.0 &#956;g/kg group and 3/19 (15.8%) in the 0.5 &#956;g/kg group experienced serious adverse events. The three adverse events in the higher dose (1.0 &#956;g/kg IFN) group included a disease flare, thrombosis of the brachiocephalic vein, and a grand mal seizure. All serious adverse events in the 0.5 &#956;g/kg group were related to lack of efficacy, resulting in hospitalisation and intensification of treatment in the three patients. There were no serious adverse events in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK> found 4 serious adverse events, one (1/62, 1.61%) with worsening of ulcerative colitis in the IFN-&#946;-1a group, and three in the placebo group (3/61, 4.92%), of which, two patients experienced worsening of UC and one patients had a tibial fracture. <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> reported five serious adverse events (one event in the placebo group and two in each of the IFN-&#946;-1a groups), A pooled analysis of four studies showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced a serious adverse event. Four per cent (12/294) of IFN patients had a serious adverse event compared to 5% (8/174) placebo patients (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis excluding an abstract publication did not change the results (RR 1.03, 95% 0.10 to 10.87).</P>
<P>b. Withdrawals (including those due to adverse events)</P>
<P>Eighteen per cent (16/91) of patients withdrew from the <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK> study. Withdrawal was most common in the placebo group at 24% followed by 17% in the low dose IFNs group and 12% in the high dose IFNs group. Reasons for discontinuation included two withdrawals due to worsening health and one withdrawal due to intolerable adverse events. However, the authors did not report which study medication these patients received. <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK> reported a 29% (2/7) withdrawal rate amongst placebo treated patients, and a substantial 60% (6/10) non-completion rate amongst IFNs treated individuals. Both of the placebo patients who withdrew and four of six IFNs patients withdrew due to progressive disease. One IFNs patient withdrew due to an adverse event (influenza like symptoms). There were no withdrawals due to adverse events in the placebo group. A high withdrawal rate was documented in the <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK> study. More than half (11/20 = 55.0%) of the placebo patients dropped out, compared to 48% (10/21) of the high dose IFNs group, and 32% (6/19) in the low dose IFNs group. Of these, one individual (1/20 = 5%) in the placebo group and 2 patients (2/21 = 10%) in the high dose IFNs group withdrew due to adverse events (fever in the placebo treated patients, and unspecified 'serious' adverse events in the IFNs patients), while the remaining individuals withdrew due to disease progression. In the <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK> study, there were 3/16 (19%) withdrawals in the IFNs group, two of these patients were noted to have abnormal liver biochemistry and one experienced progressive disease. No patients withdrew from the prednisolone enema group. <LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK> reported that 8% (5/62) of IFNs patients withdrew due to adverse events, compared to 3% (2/61) of placebo patients. Details of the adverse events were not reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> study, ten patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events - four in the IFN-&#946;-1a 44 &#956;g group, six in the IFN-&#946;-1a 66 &#956;g group, and none in the placebo group. In the IFN-&#946;-1a 44 &#956;g group, two patients withdrew because of constitutional symptoms and one withdrew due to severe thrombocytopenia, anemia and macrohematuria concurrent with an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. In the IFN-&#946;-1a 66 &#956;g group, three patients withdrew because of constitutional symptoms and one patient discontinued because of worsening of UC.</P>
<P>The data were meta-analysed in two ways: firstly, comparing the overall withdrawal rate amongst type I IFNs against placebo; then comparing the withdrawal rate due to adverse events for the same groups. A fixed-effect model was used for the overall withdrawal rate as there was minimal heterogeneity (P = 0.40, I<SUP>2</SUP>=2.0%). All five placebo-controlled studies were used for the analysis, with a total of 485 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in withdrawal rates. Twenty-one per cent (64/304) of patients in the IFNs group withdrew before the end of the study compared to 22% (39/181) of placebo patients (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29; P = 0.90). A sensitivity analysis excluding an abstract publication did not change the results (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.36). A fixed-effect model was used for withdrawal due to adverse events as there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.62, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Four trials with a total of 394 patients were included in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>). There was a statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Seven per cent (18/242) of patients in the IFNs group withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% (3/152) of placebo patients (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 9.40; P = 0.03). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-09-03 10:11:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests that type I IFNs are not effective for the treatment of patients with active UC (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Musch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Musch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikolaus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolaus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tilg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tilg 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies showed no difference in clinical remission or response rates. There was no difference in the time to remission nor a difference in endoscopic activity index scores following treatment with IFN compared to placebo. The only study to show a statistically significant improvement in a clinical activity index and quality of life compared treatment with IFN-&#945;-2a to prednisolone enemas in patients with left-sided colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2001</LINK>). The response to therapy may reflect the limited extent of the disease in these patients. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias (i.e. open-label design) and the small number of patients enrolled.</P>
<P>The most common adverse events related to IFN therapy included headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, back pain, nausea, application site reactions, rigors, and fever. There did not appear to be a difference in the adverse event profile of the different isoforms of IFN. There were no differences in the proportion of patients experiencing 'serious' adverse events which were defined as those that required specific treatment, including but not limited to escalation of therapy for UC, hospitalisation, or any symptoms which led to withdrawal from the trial. Based on the pooled data from four trials, there was an increased rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in IFN treated patients.</P>
<P>The above data could not fully address concerns raised by a handful of case reports that suggest that IFN therapy may exacerbate UC (<LINK REF="REF-Tursi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tursi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprenger-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprenger 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mavrogiannis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavrogiannis 2001</LINK>). This would need to be studied by reviewing controlled clinical trials of type I IFNs in patients who are in remission.</P>
<P>The results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to methodological concerns with the included studies. Even with data from the new included studies <LINK REF="STD-Pena_x002d_Rossi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pena-Rossi 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mannon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mannon 2010</LINK>, there were only 362 patients in the pooled analysis for clinical remission and only 425 patients in the pooled analysis for clinical response. These sample sizes likely have suboptimal power to detect a difference in treatment effect should one exist. A sample size calculation was performed based on the magnitude of the observed treatment effect in the pooled analysis. Using the pooled proportion of patients achieving remission in the IFN group of 36.0% (87/242) and 30.0% (36/120) in the placebo group, &#945;=0.05, &#946;=0.8, a case sample size of 1954 individuals would be required assuming a 1:1 case:control ratio for two independent populations of UC patients and no cross-overs. Furthermore, this estimate is conservative and does not take into account the potential yet substantial withdrawal rates demonstrated in the existing trials.</P>
<P>There was clinical heterogeneity with variability in the isoform of IFN used (&#945; versus &#946;) and even in the studies using the same preparation of IFN-&#946;-1a, there were marked differences in the dose used and the overall duration of treatment. It is possible that there may be isoform dependent and dose dependent effects.</P>
<P>The use of different clinical indices for measuring UC activity limited comparison of treatment efficacy data. The use of standardised validated clinical activity indices should be emphasised. The use of the same endoscopic activity index permitted comparisons. However, the length of treatment and follow-up may have been insufficient to allow for maximal endoscopic response.</P>
<P>Based on the existing literature, the current evidence does not support the use of type I IFNs for induction of remission in patients with UC. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the tolerability of this class of treatment.</P>
