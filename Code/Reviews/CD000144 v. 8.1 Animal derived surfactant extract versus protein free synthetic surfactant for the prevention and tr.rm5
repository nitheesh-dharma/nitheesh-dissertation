<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-16 20:55:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review question: Does the use of animal derived surfactant preparations compared to synthetic surfactant preparations that do not contain protein lead to improved outcome in infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome?</P>
<P>Background: Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. Newborn babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) have immature lungs and are often lacking in pulmonary surfactant. Commercially available surfactant preparations (either animal derived surfactant preparations or synthetic surfactant preparations that may or may not contain protein) can be given to these babies and have been proven to decrease the severity of RDS and increase the survival rates of babies with RDS. However, it is unclear whether significant differences in clinical outcome exist among the available animal derived surfactant preparations or the protein-free synthetic surfactant preparations.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: Fifteen randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Results: This review of trials compared animal derived surfactant extracts with synthetic surfactants that did not contain protein and found a decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and death in babies receiving animal derived surfactant extracts.</P>
<P>Some evidence that animal derived surfactant extract leads to better outcomes in babies with respiratory distress syndrome compared to synthetic surfactants that do not contains proteins.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-16 21:39:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants). </P>
<P>Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants). </P>
<P>The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 19:13:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-28 05:08:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is primarily a disease of the preterm infant and is due to lung immaturity and a deficiency of endogenous surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). The incidence of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age. Sixty per cent of infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation will have RDS, 30% of infants born between 28 and 34 weeks gestation will develop RDS, and less than 5% of infants born after 34 weeks will develop RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of RDS is secondary to lung immaturity and surfactant deficiency. Most infants with RDS are born prior to the alveolarization stage of lung development (which occurs at ~ 32 weeks gestation) (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2006</LINK>). At lower gestational ages, pulmonary surfactant is not produced in sufficient amounts or with the correct composition of phospholipids and surfactant proteins due to the immaturity of the type II pneumocyte where surfactant is produced, stored and secreted (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). These cells start to differentiate during the canalicular phase of lung development and reach their final, mature stage by the alveolar phase (~ 32 weeks gestation) (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surfactant is composed of phospholipids and four surfactant proteins, A, B, C and D (SP A, B, C, D). Endogenous surfactant is packaged in the lamellar bodies of the type II pneumocyte, which secrete the surfactant by exocytosis into the extracellular space. Phosphotidylcholine is the major phospholipid found in surfactant and is responsible for decreasing the surface tension at the air-water interface in the alveoli (<LINK REF="REF-Clements-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clements 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2006</LINK>). The surfactant proteins all have different functions (<LINK REF="REF-Possmayer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Possmayer 1990</LINK>). SP B and C facilitate the adsorption of the surfactant lipids to the air-water interface and are essential for the surfactant&#8217;s surface tension lowering properties (<LINK REF="REF-Gower-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2008</LINK>). SP A and D are involved in innate immunity and immunomodulation (<LINK REF="REF-Gower-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2008</LINK>). Genetic SP B deficiency is a cause of fatal neonatal respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nogee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nogee 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitsett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitsett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gower-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2008</LINK>). SP C deficiency is associated with respiratory disease that occurs later in life, but the presentation is variable with some patients presenting in the neonatal period with a rapid deterioration in respiratory status or patients present with interstitial lung disease later in life (<LINK REF="REF-Nogee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nogee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gower-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>The result of preterm birth is decreased surface area for gas exchange and increased surface tension at the alveolar level resulting in atelectasis and intra-pulmonary shunting leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxia with subsequent respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). Progressive atelectasis, which results in decreased functional residual capacity, causes further lung injury that leads to exudation of protein into the extracellular space, edema and further inactivation of endogenous pulmonary surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically, RDS is characterized by increased work of breathing and cyanosis (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). Chest radiographs reveal the characteristic 'ground glass' appearance to the lung secondary to atelectasis with superimposed air bronchograms. Without intervention, RDS is progressive and potentially fatal.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-28 04:53:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary surfactant decreases alveolar surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse and atelectasis, allowing for increased functional residual capacity, increased compliance, and improved oxygenation and ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). In infants that are deficient in surfactant or have surfactant inactivation, surfactant replacement therapy has been shown to improve oxygenation and chest X-ray (CXR) findings within one hour after administration (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-14 15:02:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of surfactant therapy in both the prevention and treatment of RDS in infants that are at risk of or with the disease. Surfactant administration decreases the severity of respiratory distress, decreases the frequency of pneumothorax, increases survival without chronic lung disease, and decreases mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). Surfactant preparations are now widely used and have been credited with recent improvements in overall infant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1993b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1994</LINK>). A wide variety of surfactant preparations have been developed and tested. These include synthetic surfactants and surfactants derived from animal sources. Synthetic surfactants can be protein free or contain peptides that are thought to mimic proteins found in pulmonary surfactant (see below) (<LINK REF="STD-Moya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moya 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2005</LINK>). Animal derived surfactants are derived from both bovine and porcine sources, and all contain varying degrees of SP B and C as well as phospholipids (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactants and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of these surfactant preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Tooley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tooley 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timing of surfactant administration also plays an important role in the therapeutic benefit of surfactant replacement therapy (SRT). Although aggressive prophylactic treatment may no longer be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>), studies have demonstrated that early SRT vs. late, selective SRT improves outcomes with significant reductions in the rates of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death (<LINK REF="REF-Bahadue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadue 2012</LINK>). </P>

<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the following criteria.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>

<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</LI>

<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses.

<LI>Selective reporting bias. For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<LI>Other sources of bias. For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk; high risk; unclear risk.  </LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Hudak-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hudak 1997</LINK>: conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal, Burroughs Wellcome) and a surfactant extract of calf lung lavage (Infasurf, Forest Laboratories) in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Premature infants less than 29 weeks gestational age were randomly assigned to prophylactic surfactant administration with colfosceril palmitate (n = 438) or Infasurf (n = 433) at birth and, if still intubated, at 12 and 24 hours of age. Crossover treatment was allowed within 72 hours of age if severe respiratory failure persisted after three doses of the assigned surfactant. The clinicians were unaware of treatment assignment. Primary outcome measures included the incidence of RDS, the incidence of death due to RDS, and the incidence of survival without BPD at 28 days after birth. Of 871 randomized infants, 18 infants did not receive treatment with a study surfactant, and 25 infants did not meet all eligibility criteria. The primary analysis of efficacy was performed in the 846 eligible infants and analysis of safety outcomes in the 853 infants who received study surfactant. Demographic characteristics did not differ between the two treatment groups. Compared with colfosceril palmitate, calf lung surfactant treatment resulted in a decrease in the incidence of RDS (16% vs. 42%) and a decrease in death due to RDS (1.7% vs. 5.4%) but did not increase the incidence of survival without BPD at 28 days. Treatment with calf lung surfactant resulted in significant improvement in several secondary outcome measures including lower average FIO<SUB>2</SUB> and lower average mean airway pressure for the first 72 hours of life. Crossover surfactant treatment was significantly less frequent in the animal derived surfactant compared with the colfosceril palmitate group (1% vs. 6%). Animal surfactant-treated infants had significantly less air leak (8% vs. 14%). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) occurred more frequently in animal surfactant-treated infants (39.0% vs. 29.9%) but the incidence of severe IVH (Grade 3 and 4) did not differ between the two groups (animal derived 11.8% vs. synthetic 8.3%).</P>

Sixty-six infants with birth weights less than or equal to 1500 g who required assisted ventilation, supplemental oxygen greater than 40%, and had radiographic evidence of RDS were entered in the study. Infants received beractant (n = 33) or colfosceril palmitate (n = 33) by random assignment within 24 hours of birth, and received additional doses at 12 hour intervals (up to four doses) if the infants remained on assisted ventilation and required supplemental oxygen greater than 30%. Infants who received beractant and colfosceril palmitate were similar regarding birth weight (1000 ± 280 g and 990 ± 237 g respectively) and gestational age (27 ± 3 weeks and 27 ± 2 weeks), baseline clinical characteristics and ventilator settings. Mean time from birth to treatment was comparable between the two groups (beractant 5 ± 3 hours, colfosceril palmitate 4 ± 2 hours).

The study was conducted at 11 tertiary care university neonatal intensive care units participating in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Newborn infants (n = 617) weighing 501 to 1500 g with RDS who were receiving assisted ventilation with 30% oxygen or more within six hours of birth were enrolled. Infants were randomly assigned to receive up to four intratracheal doses of either colfosceril palmitate (n = 309) or beractant (n = 308). During the 72 hours after the first surfactant dose, the average fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) (± SEM) was 0.50 ± 0.01 for colfosceril palmitate and 0.42 ± 0.01 for beractant (difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11); the average MAP (± SEM) was 7.64 ± 0.21 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for colfosceril palmitate and 6.93 ± 0.21 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for beractant (difference 0.71 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.29 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O).

<LINK REF="STD-VT-Oxford-1996" TYPE="STUDY">VT Oxford 1996</LINK>, Vermont-Oxford Neonatal Network: conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal, Burroughs Wellcome Co.) and modified bovine surfactant extract beractant (Survanta, Ross Laboratories) for the treatment of neonatal RDS. Premature infants (n = 1296) weighing 501 to 1500 g with RDS requiring assisted ventilation with 30% oxygen or more were enrolled within six hours of birth at 38 neonatal intensive care units participating in the Vermont Oxford Neonatal Network. Infants were randomly assigned to receive up to four intratracheal doses of the synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (n = 644) or the modified bovine surfactant extract beractant (n = 652). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of death or chronic lung disease (CLD) 28 days after birth. Death or CLD occurred in 57% of the infants treated with colfosceril palmitate and in 54% of those infants treated with beractant (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.04). Infants with birth weights of 1001 to 1500 g who received beractant had a significantly lower risk of CLD or death at 28 days (27% vs. 34%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99). Treatment with beractant led to significant improvement in several secondary outcome measures. Beractant treated infants received less supplemental oxygen and had lower mean airway pressures six and 72 hours after treatment. Beractant treated infants had significantly fewer pneumothoraces (9% vs. 15%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). There were no differences between the groups in the incidence of other neonatal complications.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hudak-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hudak 1996</LINK>: conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal, Burroughs Wellcome) and a surfactant extract of calf lung lavage (Infasurf, Forest Laboratories) in the treatment of neonatal RDS. Infants with RDS who were undergoing mechanical ventilation were eligible for treatment with two doses of either a synthetic or natural surfactant if the a/A O<SUB>2</SUB> ratio was less than or equal to 0.22. Crossover treatment was allowed within 96 hours of age if severe respiratory failure (defined as two consecutive a/A oxygen tension ratios &#8804; 0.10) persisted after two doses of the randomly assigned surfactant. The trial was conducted at 21 centers. Investigators were unaware of treatment assignment. Primary outcome measures included the incidence of pulmonary air leak, the severity of RDS, the incidence of death from RDS, and the incidence of survival without BPD at 28 days after birth. The primary analysis of efficacy was performed in 1033 eligible infants and an analysis of safety outcomes in the 1126 infants who received study surfactant. Demographic characteristics and respiratory status were similar for the two treatment groups, except for a small but significant difference in mean gestational age (0.5 week) that favored the calf lung surfactant treatment group. Pulmonary air leak occurred in 21% of colfosceril palmitate treated infants and 11% of calf lung surfactant treated infants (adjusted RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.71). During the 72 hours after the initial surfactant treatment, infants who received calf lung surfactant had a lower average fraction of inspired oxygen and a lower average mean airway pressure. The incidence of RDS-related death, total respiratory death, death prior to discharge, and survival without BPD at 28 days after birth did not differ. The number of days of more than 30% inspired oxygen and of assisted ventilation, but not the duration of hospitalization, were significantly lower in calf lung surfactant treated infants.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Modanlou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Modanlou 1997</LINK>: conducted a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of a synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal, Burroughs Wellcome) and a natural surfactant extract beractant (Survanta, Ross Laboratories) on the early course of RDS, arterial blood gases, ventilator support, outcome morbidity rate, and complications of prematurity. The trial included infants treated sequentially with colfosceril palmitate (when this was the only FDA approved surfactant preparation), and infants randomly assigned to either colfosceril palmitate or beractant (once beractant became available as an approved alternative). During the randomized phase of the study 61 infants were randomly assigned to receive colfosceril palmitate and 61 infants were assigned to beractant. Although the two randomized groups were similar in severity of RDS based on FiO<SUB>2</SUB> and ventilator support, a significantly greater improvement in respiratory function (as evidenced by FiO<SUB>2</SUB>, mean airway pressure, a/A PaO<SUB>2</SUB> difference, and oxygen index) was observed in the beractant group from 12 hours through 48 hours.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Murdoch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Murdoch 1998</LINK>: Murdoch and colleagues sought to determine the effects of animal derived surfactant compared to synthetic surfactant on cerebral hemodynamics. Twenty preterm infants receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive poractant alfa (Curosurf) or colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal). Anterior cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CABFV) was measured using Doppler ultrasound before and up to two hours after treatment. Following animal surfactant treatment, there was a rapid reduction in CABF, whereas artificial surfactant resulted in a slower rise which was less marked. Animal derived surfactant produced rapid improvements in ventilation that were associated with marked alterations in cerebral haemodynamics. The only reported clinical outcomes were mortality and IVH. In a following study (Murdoch 2000), the investigators evaluated the effect of different surfactants on fluid balance. Data were collected on ventilatory parameters, daily urine output, daily weight, fluid intake and serum electrolytes. Ventilatory requirements decreased more rapidly in infants receiving animal derived surfactant, with significantly greater reductions in mean airway pressure from one to 48 hours. No other clinically relevant outcomes were reported.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-daCosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">daCosta 1999</LINK>: conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects of a synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal, Burroughs Wellcome) and the modified natural surfactant extract beractant (Survanta, Ross Laboratories) in infants with neonatal RDS. Eighty-nine patients were randomly allocated to receive one of the two surfactants. Primary outcome variables included both acute and long-term effects of the surfactant preparations, specifically the oxygenation index at 24 hours and the combined incidence of CLD or death at 28 days. Oxygenation indices in the colfosceril palmitate and beractant groups at 24 hours were similar. However, the magnitude and rapidity of responses were greater for beractant than for colfosceril palmitate. When a/A oxygen tension ratios were compared, the colfosceril palmitate group had a significantly worse a/A ratio at 24 hours than the beractant group (0.21 vs. 0.37). The combined incidence of death or CLD was not different in the two groups (18.6% colfosceril palmitate vs. 15.2% beractant). There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of other complications of prematurity.</P>

In this single center, 39 preterm infants between 24 to 32 week gestation were randomized into three groups: poractant alfa at 100 mg/kg [n = 17, mean (SD) birth weight of 926 (278) gram, mean (SD) gestational age of 26.8 (2.4) weeks], colfosceril palmitate at 67.5 mg/kg [ n = 12, mean (SD) birth weight of 956 (233) gram, mean (SD) gestational age of 26.9 (1.9) weeks] and beractant at 100 mg/kg [n =10, mean (SD) birth weight of 1011 (327) gram, mean (SD) gestational age of 27.3 (2.0) weeks]. The study was initially designed to compare only two surfactants (poractant alfa and colfosceril palmitate) and later included beractant, hence differences in number of patients in each group. For purposes of this review, infants randomized to "any animal derived surfactant" (poractant alfa or beractant) was compared to the synthetic surfactant colfosceril palmitate. Method of randomization and any attempt for blinding was not reported. Envelopes were used for allocation concealment. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1999</LINK>: conducted a study to determine the phospholipid composition of lung aspirates in infants that received colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf), an artificial surfactant, or beractant (Survanta), an animal derived surfactant, compared to an untreated control group of infants with 'normal lungs'. Infants less than 32 weeks gestation with RDS were randomly assigned to receive either colfosceril palmitate or beractant. Endotracheal or hypopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from these infants and from the control infants to determine the phospholipid composition of the lung fluid. The aspirates were taken prior to and up to 28 days following surfactant administration. The different phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography and expressed as a per cent of total phospholipid measured.</P>
<P>Infants with 'normal lungs' had a higher proportion of phosphatidylcholine prior to treatment than those with RDS. The infants with 'normal lungs' had a greater proportion of phosphatidylinositol in their lung aspirates than both treatment groups at 24 hours. Infants in the beractant group had a higher proportion of phosphatidylglycerol at 48 hours than the group with 'normal lungs'. No other differences were found in phospholipid composition up to 28 days. There were no major differences in the phospholipid profile in infants with RDS treated with either colfosceril palmitate or beractant.</P>
<P>Infants that received colfosceril palmitate had increased mean airway pressure and oxygen requirements at 24 hours when compared to beractant (8.1 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O vs. 7.7 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, P &lt; 0.02 and 34% vs. 28%, P &lt; 0.006 respectively). The incidence of CLD at 36 weeks postconceptual age was not statistically significant between the groups. Neither the clinical differences initially seen between infants treated with colfosceril palmitate or beractant nor the long-term outcomes could be explained by the phospholipid composition of serial samples of lung aspirates.</P>

Outcome data were analyzed for 199 babies. The trial was stopped on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee because of concern regarding increased mortality in the group receiving synthetic surfactant (poractant alfa 14% vs. pumactant 31%; odds ratio 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-16 21:37:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-protein containing synthetic surfactants and animal derived surfactant extracts have both been proven to be effective in the prevention and treatment of RDS and have become widely available for clinical use (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>). Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both non-protein containing synthetic surfactants and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of these surfactants (<LINK REF="REF-Tooley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tooley 1987</LINK>). The randomized controlled trials that have been conducted comparing animal derived surfactant extract to non-protein containing synthetic surfactant have universally demonstrated greater improvement in immediate need for ventilator support in infants who receive animal derived surfactant extracts (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The meta-analyses support a significant decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; NNT 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants) and a marginal decrease in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; 13 studies, 5413 infants) associated with animal derived surfactant treatment. In addition, the meta-analyses support a marginal decrease in the risk of BPD or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00).</P>
<P>However, there is a trend toward an increased risk of IVH (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. The increased risk in overall IVH is not reflected in an increased risk of severe IVH (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants).This increased risk was noted in the initial randomized controlled trials and was thought to be related to changes in cerebral blood flow after surfactant administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gunkel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunkel 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this updated meta-analysis, a concern regarding an increase in the risk of NEC is noted in association with animal derived surfactant treatment. However, this risk does not outweigh the more clinically important improvements seen in mortality. A rough estimate from these analyses project that for every 100 infants we treat with an animal derived product as opposed to a protein free synthetic product we see four fewer pneumothoraces, two fewer deaths but two additional cases of NEC and two additional cases of IVH of any grade.</P>

<P>Both animal derived surfactant extracts and synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. A trend toward improved survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia is noted. An increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis is seen with animal derived products. In addition, an increase in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage is seen with animal derived surfactant extract administration but is only reflected in the lesser grades of hemorrhage. On clinical grounds, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available synthetic surfactants.</P>

<P>Endotracheal or hypopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from these infants and from control infants who had normal lungs. The aspirates were taken prior to and up to 28 days following surfactant administration. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography and expressed as a per cent of total phospholipid measured. Infants with normal lungs had a higher proportion of phosphatidylcholine than those with RDS prior to treatment. The infants with normal lungs had a greater proportion of phosphatidylinositol in their lung aspirates than both treatment groups at 24 h. Infants in the beractant (Survanta) group had a higher proportion of phosphatidylglycerol at 48 h than the group with normal lungs. No other differences were found in phospholipid composition up to 28 days. There were no major differences in the phospholipid profile in infants with RDS treated with either colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal) or beractant (Survanta). Neither the clinical differences initially seen between infants treated with either colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf Neonatal) or beractant (Survanta) nor the long-term outcome could be explained by the phospholipid composition of serial samples of lung aspirates</P>
