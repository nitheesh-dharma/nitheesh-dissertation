<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-25 12:06:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> For sick babies admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), how effective is midazolam, given by continuous intravenous drip, as a sedative for reducing stress, as measured by changes in behaviour and vital signs?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Proper sedation for babies undergoing uncomfortable procedures while receiving intensive care may reduce stress and avoid complications. Midazolam is a sedative that is used increasingly in NICUs. However, researchers have not systematically reviewed the evidence to see if it is effective and safe for babies in this setting.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> We have selected for inclusion in this review randomised controlled trials of continuous intravenous drip of midazolam as a sedative in babies aged 28 days or younger.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> We included three clinical trials in this review. Using different scales to measure level of sedation, each study showed that midazolam was effective in providing sedation to babies. However, the validity of the sedation scales used in these studies has not been proven in babies; therefore, we cannot be certain that midazolam is, in fact, an effective sedative for babies. Moreover, one study showed that babies who received midazolam had a significantly higher risk of death or brain injury, and combined results of two studies showed that midazolam use may prolong length of stay in the NICU.</P>
<P>
<B>Industry: </B>One of the studies included in this review received support from industry, and for the other two studies, industry provided all study drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B> We assessed the quality of the evidence on the outcomes of mortality during hospital stay, length of stay in the NICU, pain, and neurological outcomes at 28 days of life and found the evidence to be of moderate quality, as there was not enough evidence available. Therefore, we conclude there is not enough evidence to support the use of midazolam as a sedative for babies undergoing intensive care. Additional research is needed to address the safety and effectiveness of midazolam in this population.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 20:19:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We abstracted data regarding the primary outcome of level of sedation. We assessed secondary outcomes such as intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, death, length of NICU stay and adverse effects associated with midazolam. When appropriate, we performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs), and if the RD was statistically significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for categorical variables, and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. We assessed heterogeneity by performing the I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) test.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:19:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in the review three trials enrolling 148 neonates. We identified no new trials for this update. Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group. However, none of the sedation scales used have been validated in preterm infants; therefore, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of midazolam in this population. Duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the midazolam group than in the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95% CI 0.40 to 10.5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; two studies, 89 infants). One study (43 infants) reported significantly lower Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores during midazolam infusion than during dextrose (placebo) infusion (MD -3.80, 95% CI -5.93 to -1.67). Another study (46 infants) observed a higher incidence of adverse neurological events at 28 days' postnatal age (death, grade III or IV IVH or PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the morphine group (RR 7.64, 95% CI 1.02 to 57.21; RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 14) (tests for heterogeneity not applicable). We considered these trials to be of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment based on the following outcomes: mortality during hospital stay, length of NICU stay, adequacy of analgesia according to PIPP scores and poor neurological outcomes by 28 days' postnatal age.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:28:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:27:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Term and preterm infants are capable of perceiving pain and stress (<LINK REF="REF-Anand-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 1987</LINK>). In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), supportive and investigative management of sick infants frequently requires painful and uncomfortable procedures. However, because pain and stress are subjective phenomena and are difficult to evaluate in preverbal infants, use of appropriate analgesia and sedatives is often overlooked by care providers. It has been suggested that responses to pain may compromise clinical conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Anand-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 1992</LINK>), and that adequate sedation during mechanical ventilation may decrease stress (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1993</LINK>) and facilitate effective ventilation, so that complications such as pneumothoraces and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) may be prevented (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1985</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 08:47:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benzodiazepines, administered as intravenous infusions or as intravenous boluses, can be used to provide sedation, but not analgesia, in many clinical settings. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that has been used increasingly in the NICU.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:28:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benzodiazepines are a class of sedatives that act on specific receptors in the central nervous system. These receptors, which are present in the foetus from seven weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hebebrand-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebebrand 1988</LINK>), potentiate the neuronal inhibitory pathways mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<LINK REF="REF-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacqz-Aigrain 1996</LINK>). Researchers have studied the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in neonates. Midazolam is preferred over other benzodiazepines because of its water solubility and rapid clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacqz-Aigrain 1992</LINK>). Although its elimination half-life is significantly shorter than that of other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, its elimination is delayed in preterm neonates compared with older infants and children (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1999</LINK>). Functional immaturity of hepatic and renal systems in preterm neonates probably accounts for the slower elimination of midazolam. In a recent very large cohort study conducted in Europe, midazolam was given to 576 (9%) of the total cohort of 6680 neonates and to 536 (25%) of 2142 neonates who were tracheally ventilated (<LINK REF="REF-Carbajal-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbajal 2015</LINK>). Overall, midazolam was by far the sedative most commonly used. It was given to 25% of neonates who had tracheal ventilation, and its use ranged from 0% to 73% across European countries, despite few clinical data to lend support for midazolam sedation in neonates.</P>
<P>It is of note that in an animal model, <LINK REF="REF-Koch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 2008</LINK> reported paradoxical effects of midazolam on nociception and sedation in rats between postnatal days 3 and 10. Midazolam failed to sedate young rats and instead caused an excitatory effect by sensitising their flexor reflex activity. Investigators did not observe the sedative effects of midazolam in supraspinal centres until later in life, after maturation. These results highlight the need for better understanding of the ontogeny of pharmacological effects of drugs such as midazolam that are used routinely in NICUs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>

In terms of the primary outcome of level of sedation, none of the sedation scales used in these studies had been validated in preterm infants; therefore, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of midazolam in this population as reported by these studies and did not subject this outcome to GRADE assessment.</P>
<P>We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (and two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach assesses the quality of a body of evidence and assigns one of four grades.</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but may be substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK> randomly assigned 46 preterm infants (25 at &lt; 33 weeks' gestation and 21 at &#8805; 33 weeks' gestation) &#8804; 48 hours of age to receive midazolam infusion or manufactured placebo for five days while mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome. Twenty-four infants received midazolam and 22 received placebo infusions. Researchers withdrew one infant in the midazolam group because of major neurological abnormalities at 24 hours of age; and two infants from the midazolam group and two from the placebo group within 72 hours owing to rapid clinical improvement. They noted contamination in one infant in the placebo group (midazolam was detectable in the serum at 24 hours). Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Severity of illness, as measured by mean airway pressure (MAP) while ventilated and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) from the time of enrolment to the end of the study, was not significantly different between groups. Investigators administered midazolam as an infusion at 60 microgram/kg/h for up to five days in infants at &#8805; 33 weeks' gestation, and at 60 microgram/kg/h for one day followed by 30 microgram/kg/h for up to a total of five days in infants at &lt; 33 weeks' gestation. They did not report the duration of the infusion. Weaning of sedatives was allowed after at least 48 hours of administration, but investigators did not specify a weaning protocol. The primary outcome was adequacy of sedation as measured by a behavioural score adapted from the clinical neurological and behavioural scoring system of Barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Barrier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrier 1989</LINK>) and by changes in physiological variables (heart rate and blood pressure). The sedation score consisted of five items that assessed facial expression, sucking, spontaneous motor activity, excitability/responsiveness to stimulation and excessive flexion, with scores ranging from 0 (sedation) to 5 (inadequate sedation). Care providers measured the sedation score four times per day during treatment (nurses twice, physicians twice). Secondary outcomes included days of ventilation support, days of supplemental oxygen, surfactant use, duration of NICU stay and common complications of preterm birth (e.g. pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, hypotension, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, intracranial haemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, death). Researchers reported outcomes for all 46 infants.</P>
<P>In a multi-centre randomised pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK>), investigators assigned 67 preterm infants of 24 to 32 weeks' gestation who were &#8804; 72 hours of age and who were ventilated for less than eight hours to receive midazolam infusion, morphine infusion or dextrose placebo infusion for as long as sedation was considered necessary up to a maximum of 14 days. Twenty-two infants received midazolam infusion, 24 received morphine infusion and 21 received dextrose placebo. The three groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. Severity of illness at birth, as assessed by the Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) score (<LINK REF="REF-The-International-Neonatal-Network" TYPE="REFERENCE">The International Neonatal Network</LINK>), showed no significant differences among groups at birth (P = 0.24). However, severity of illness as measured by the Neonatal Medical Index (NMI) (<LINK REF="REF-Korner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korner 1993</LINK>) on the basis of response variables during the hospital stay showed significant differences in the distribution of risk categories among the three groups at discharge (P = 0.01). Researchers administered midazolam at 200 microgram/kg loading dose followed by an infusion of 20 microgram/kg/h, 40 microgram/kg/h or 60 microgram/kg/h for infants of gestational age 24 to 26 weeks, 27 to 20 weeks or 30 to 33 weeks, respectively. They administered morphine at 100 microgram/kg loading dose followed by an infusion of 10 microgram/kg/h, 20 microgram/kg/h or 30 microgram/kg/h for infants of gestational age 24 to 26 weeks, 27 to 29 weeks or 30 to 33 weeks, respectively. Duration of the infusion was not different among groups (5.1 days vs 3.4 days vs 5.0 days in the midazolam, morphine and placebo groups, respectively; P = 0.37). If necessary, they provided additional boluses of morphine and documented the frequency and amount given as measures of inadequate sedation. Investigators used a standardised protocol in weaning sedatives. The primary outcome was the incidence of adverse neurological events (defined as neonatal death, grade III or IV IVH or PVL). Researchers measured the adequacy of sedation by obtaining the COMFORT score, an eight-item behavioural and physiological measurement of distress in the paediatric intensive care unit (<LINK REF="REF-Ambuel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambuel 1992</LINK>). This score includes assessment of alertness, calmness/agitation, respiratory response, physical movement, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone and facial tension, with scores ranging from 8 (sedated) to 40 (not adequately sedated). They measured adequacy of analgesia by obtaining the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1996</LINK>) in response to tracheal suctioning. The PIPP score includes assessment of gestational age, behavioural state, heart rate, oxygen saturation, brow bulge, eye squeeze and nasolabial furrow, with scores ranging from 0 (adequate analgesia) to 21 (inadequate analgesia). They obtained the two scores on all infants at baseline, after 24 hours of infusion and at 10 to 12 hours after discontinuation of the infusion. Other secondary outcomes included days of mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, supplemental oxygen use, incidence of pneumothorax, duration of NICU and hospital stay, days to full enteral (full strength, full gavage, full oral) feeds, daily weight gain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 weeks' corrected age as measured by Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Premature Infant (NAPI) examination cluster scores (<LINK REF="REF-Korner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korner 1991</LINK>). Researchers reported outcomes for all 67 infants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Arya-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2001</LINK> randomised 33 infants with birth weight &lt; 2000 grams and requiring mechanical ventilation during the first week of life to receive midazolam or placebo infusion for sedation. Seventeen infants received midazolam and 16 received placebo. The two groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Severity of respiratory illness, as measured by peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), MAP, oxygenation index (OI) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO<SUB>2</SUB>), was similar between the two groups at the time of enrolment. Investigators administered midazolam intravenously at 200 microgram/kg loading dose followed by an infusion of 60 microgram/kg/h. Infants in both groups also received morphine infusion at 10 microgram/kg/h during the study period. The study concentrated on the first 48 hours of midazolam infusion and did not report on duration of benzodiazepine use nor on method of weaning. Three infants in each group did not complete the first 24 hours of the study, and four in each group did not complete 48 hours of the study. Reasons for withdrawal were death (13 infants) and extubation (one infant). Researchers included these infants in the analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was adequacy of sedation as measured by a behavioural score adapted from the clinical neurological and behavioural scoring system of Barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Barrier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrier 1989</LINK>). This is the same scoring system used in <LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK>. Study authors assessed infants for adequacy of sedation before midazolam administration, then every six hours over the 48-hour study period. Other measured outcomes included changes in physiological variables (heart rate and blood pressure), changes in oxygen requirement (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) and ventilation requirement (PIP, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), ventilator rate) and arterial blood gas as measured by mean daily values. Investigators documented complications related to mechanical ventilation (air leak, IVH) and potential adverse effects of midazolam (epileptiform movements, hypotension, tachycardia and oliguria) while reporting the duration of ventilation. They reported no long-term outcomes but described outcomes for all 33 infants in the study.</P>

<P>Since midazolam was introduced into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the 1980s, little information has been published on its effectiveness and safety when administered to critically ill neonates. Most reports to date are case series and case reports of midazolam use in patients of diverse age groups (from three days to 18 years of age), given at variable doses (from 0.025 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg administered as a bolus, to 24 microgram/kg/h to 400 microgram/kg/h administered as an infusion) (<LINK REF="REF-Hartwig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartwig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pellier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenhammar-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenhammar 1994</LINK>). The three studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arya-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK>) are the only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to date on the use of midazolam infusion for sedation in infants. Repeated literature searches in September 2009, March 2012 and June 2016 yielded no additional trials.</P>
<P>Tools to measure level of sedation in preterm infants are few (<LINK REF="REF-AAP_x002f_CPS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP/CPS 2000</LINK>). Sedation level in such infants is currently measured by scales previously validated in older infants and children. Whether these scales are appropriate in preterm infants is unknown. Therefore, in the three RCTs included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arya-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK>), although intravenous infusion of midazolam appeared to provide an effective sedative compared with placebo, investigators could draw no definitive conclusions on its effectiveness as a sedative in preterm infants. <LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK> assessed level of sedation using the COMFORT score, a composite scale based on eight behavioural and physiological items used to assess distress (<LINK REF="REF-Ambuel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambuel 1992</LINK>). Although these items are applicable to preterm infants, this score has been validated only in older infants and children (mean age, 37.1 months). <LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Arya-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2001</LINK> used a sedation scale adapted from the scoring system of Barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Barrier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrier 1989</LINK>), which had not been validated in preterm infants, by selecting five of 10 items from the scoring system. The validity of such an adapted score in assessing sedation level in neonates is unknown.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK> showed similar incidences of intracranial haemorrhage between midazolam and control groups. However, the midazolam-treated infant who was excluded within 24 hours for major neurological abnormalities raises concern about the safety of midazolam. In <LINK REF="STD-Anand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anand 1999</LINK>, the incidence of poor neurological outcomes (death, severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)) was higher in the midazolam group than in placebo and morphine groups (32% vs 24% vs 4%, respectively; P = 0.03). It should be noted, however, that the morphine group included a higher percentage of female infants with slightly higher birth weight and more mature gestational age. These baseline characteristics may have contributed to the differences in neurological outcomes noted in these groups.</P>

We rated risk of bias as unclear for selective reporting (reporting bias), as the protocols for all three studies were not available to us. We assessed these trials as having moderate quality according to GRADE Working Group grades of evidence. Thus further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Most important, none of the sedation scales used in these trials had been validated in newborns, and we could include only a few outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The literature has reported adverse neurological effects associated with midazolam in term and preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magny-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magny 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Anker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Anker 1992</LINK>). Investigators have reported a variety of transient neurological effects after boluses or infusions, or both, of midazolam, including impaired level of consciousness, lack of visual following, hypertonia, hypotonia, choreic movements, dyskinetic movements, myoclonus and epileptiform activity. They have noted abnormalities on electroencephalograms in some cases. In all cases, effects were transient, although researchers have not reported long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Harte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harte 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Straaten-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Straaten 1992</LINK>) found a significant decrease in middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity among preterm infants administered a single bolus injection of midazolam. This effect lasted up to one hour and was directly related to a drop in mean arterial blood pressure. Thus, it appears that the neurological effects of midazolam may be related at least in part to transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Long-term sequelae of these effects remain unknown.</P>
<P>The mechanism of midazolam-induced hypotension was thought to be vasodilation related to levels of extravascular prostanoids and calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Modanlou-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modanlou 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jacqz_x002d_Aigrain-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jacqz-Aigrain 1994</LINK> found that the number of infants with haemodynamic instability was not significantly different between midazolam and placebo groups (eight vs six, respectively), although infants in the midazolam group had significantly lower blood pressure than infants in the placebo group. Other investigators (<LINK REF="REF-Burtin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burtin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Anker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Anker 1992</LINK>) observed significant hypotension in several preterm infants after bolus doses and infusions of midazolam that required volume resuscitation or vasoactive drugs. In most cases, providers had administered fentanyl concomitantly.</P>

<P>This systematic review can provide no definitive conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of midazolam infusion (in the dose range of 30 microgram/kg/h to 60 microgram/kg/h) as a sedative in preterm neonates. Authors of studies included in this review observed adverse neurological events, although possibly multi-factorial in origin, more frequently in midazolam-treated infants. These adverse effects cannot be dismissed in light of previous case reports of serious neurological and haemodynamic effects provided by non-randomised uncontrolled studies as well as studies on effects of midazolam on cerebral artery blood flow velocity. Therefore, evidence is currently insufficient to support routine use of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation of newborn infants in the NICU.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-02 14:31:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reliable, valid and clinically useful scales are needed to measure level of sedation in preverbal infants. When such scales are developed, investigators must conduct further research on the effectiveness of sedatives such as midazolam infusion on term and preterm infants. With regards to safety of midazolam use in infants, researchers must undertake additional studies on associated short-term and long-term adverse effects.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:02:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<P>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel; and</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</OL>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we reincluded missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<P>5. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (when it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (when not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; when one or more reported primary outcomes that were not prespecified outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; when study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<P>6. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 19:03:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In cases where we considered the risk of bias arising from inadequate concealment of allocation, randomised assignment, complete follow-up or blinded outcome assessment to reduce our confidence in the effect estimates, we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly. We evaluated consistency via similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical criteria including measurement of heterogeneity (I). We downgraded the quality of evidence when large and unexplained inconsistency was present across study results (i.e. some studies suggest important benefit and others no effect or harm without a clinical explanation). We assessed precision according to the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the pooled estimation. When trials were conducted in populations other than the target population, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness.</P>
