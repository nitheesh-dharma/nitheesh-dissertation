<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Low level laser therapy for rheumatoid arthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>
<B>Does low level laser therapy work for treating rheumatoid arthritis?</B>
<BR/>Six studies of medium quality were reviewed and provide the best evidence we have today. Collectively, these studies tested over 220 people with rheumatoid arthritis. The studies compared how well people did while receiving either laser therapy or a 'placebo' (fake) laser therapy. Laser therapy was given mostly on the hands and generally for two to three times a week for four weeks. There were also many different wavelengths and dosages given. </P>
<P>
<B>What is rheumatoid arthritis and low level laser therapy?</B>
<BR/>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints of the hands and feet and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat around the joints. Drug and non-drug treatments are used to relieve pain and/or swelling. Low level laser therapy, is a non-drug treatment used to decrease swelling and pain. Without producing heat, the laser emits very pure light that causes light and chemical reactions in cells where it is targeted. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>What did the studies show?</B>
<BR/>Studies showed that laser therapy decreased pain and morning stiffness more than 'placebo' laser therapy. Laser therapy also increased hand flexibility more than placebo therapy.<BR/>Pain decreased by 1.10 points on a scale of 1-10. The length of time for morning stiffness decreased by 28 minutes.</P>
<P>Studies also showed that laser therapy worked just as well as 'placebo' laser therapy to improve range of motion, function, swelling and grip strength.<BR/>Only two of the studies measured the effect of laser therapy three months after the end of treatment. The results from these studies indicated that laser therapy worked just as well as 'placebo' therapy after three months times.</P>
<P>Dose, length of laser administration time and wavelength of the laser therapies did not appear to make a significant difference, though there was some evidence indicating that longer administration times and shorter wavelengths produced better effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Were there any side effects?</B>
<BR/>No side effects were reported in the studies. </P>
<P>
<B>What is the bottom line?</B>
<BR/>There is 'silver' level evidence that low level laser therapy in people with rheumatoid arthritis for up to four weeks does decrease pain and morning stiffness. It does not appear, however, to have long-lasting effects.<BR/>Most of the studies tested laser therapy on the hand, so it is not clear whether laser therapy would affect other joints of the body the same way.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects a large proportion of the population. Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) was introduced as an alternative non-invasive treatment for RA about ten years ago. LLLT is a light source that generates extremely pure light, of a single wavelength. The effect is not thermal, but rather related to photochemical reactions in the cells. The effectiveness of LLLT for rheumatoid arthritis is still controversial. This review is an update of the original review published in October 1998.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of LLLT in the treatment of RA. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We initially searched MEDLINE, EMBASE (from 1998), the registries of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group and the field of Rehabilitation and Related Therapies as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 2001. This search has now been updated to include articles published up to June 2005. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Following an a priori protocol, only randomized controlled trials of LLLT for the treatment of patients with a clinical diagnosis of RA were eligible. Abstracts were excluded unless further data could be obtained from the authors.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, then extracted data and assessed quality using predetermined forms. Heterogeneity was tested using chi-squared. A fixed effects model was used throughout for continuous variables, except where heterogeneity existed, in which case, a random effects model was used. Results were analyzed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where the difference between the treated and control groups was weighted by the inverse of the variance. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with relative risks. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of 222 patients were included in the five placebo-controlled trials, with 130 randomized to laser therapy. Relative to a separate control group, LLLT reduced pain by 1.10 points (95% CI: 1.82, 0.39) on visual analogue scale relative to placebo, reduced morning stiffness duration by 27.5 minutes (95%CI: 2.9 to 52 minutes) and increased tip to palm flexibility by 1.3 cm (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.7). Other outcomes such as functional assessment, range of motion and local swelling did not differ between groups. There were no significant differences between subgroups based on LLLT dosage, wavelength, site of application or treatment length. For RA, relative to a control group using the opposite hand, there was no difference observed between the control and treatment hand for morning stiffness duration, and also no significant improvement in pain relief RR 13.00 (95% CI: 0.79 to 214.06). However, only one study was included as using the contralateral limb as control. . </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>LLLT could be considered for short-term treatment for relief of pain and morning stiffness for RA patients, particularly since it has few side-effects. Clinicians and researchers should consistently report the characteristics of the LLLT device and the application techniques used. New trials on LLLT should make use of standardized, validated outcomes. Despite some positive findings, this meta-analysis lacked data on how LLLT effectiveness is affected by four important factors: wavelength, treatment duration of LLLT, dosage and site of application over nerves instead of joints. There is clearly a need to investigate the effects of these factors on LLLT effectiveness for RA in randomized controlled clinical trials. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:20:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects a large proportion of the population. The prevalence of RA is increasing with the aging population in industrial countries, especially with the baby boomers phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1996</LINK>). Indeed, the number of Americans who will be diagnosed with arthritis will reach 59.4 million in 2020 compared to the 38 million diagnosed in 1990. This represents an increase of more than 59%. Thus, 18.2% of the population will be affected by arthritis: a proportion of one in five persons (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1996</LINK>). RA is recognized as an important source of disability and handicap which leads to considerable socioeconomic costs due to medical treatments, surgical interventions and frequent absences from work (<LINK REF="REF-Badley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badley 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large number of pharmacological treatments are available for RA, ranging from analgesics to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The effectiveness and severity of adverse side effects of these interventions varies.</P>
<P>A new non invasive therapy was introduced ten years ago to existing physical agents used in medicine and physiotherapy in the treatment of RA: Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), Classes I, II and III (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 1994</LINK>). Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a light source that generates extremely pure light, of a single wavelength. The effect is not thermal, but rather related to photochemical reactions in the cells. The effectiveness of laser therapy is still unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Beckerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckerman 1992</LINK>) and needs to be examined more rigorously. </P>
<P>In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that LLLT may have physiologic effects mediated by photochemical actions at the cellular level in animal and human tissues. Bassler et al. concluded that LLLT also has cartilage stimulatory properties in human beings (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 1985</LINK>). Some studies suggest that LLLT has a beneficial anti-inflammatory and pain attenuation effect in human beings (<LINK REF="REF-Ceccherelli-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceccherelli 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-King-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tsurko-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Tsurko 1983</LINK>). Some studies in animals, conducted to elucidate the possible mechanism of action of LLLT irradiation, suggest also the alteration of nerve tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Kudoh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudoh 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis on the effect of LLLT on musculoskeletal pain showed that LLLT has no effect on musculoskeletal pain syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Gam-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gam 1993</LINK>). However, this meta-analysis did not examine rheumatoid arthritis specifically. Additionally, trials which used the contralateral limb as a control were combined with those with a separate control group.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim is to assess the effectiveness of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</P>
<P>A secondary purpose is to determine the most effective method of administering LLLT for RA, including the optimal:<BR/> -wavelength<BR/> -dosage<BR/> -application techniques<BR/> -length of treatment</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:20:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Following an a priori protocol, studies were eligible if they were Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Only trials with subjects aged 18 years and over, with clinical or radiological confirmation of the diagnosis of RA were included. Trials published in languages other than French and English were not analyzed because of the time and cost involved in translation. Abstracts were excluded unless further data could be obtained from the authors.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All types of LLLT (Classes I, II, and III) including all wavelengths from 632nm to 1064nm, were included in this review. Trials which compared one intervention group using LLLT with one standard treatment were included. Trials which were placebo-controlled were also included.</P>
<P>Trials which used the opposite limb as a control were analyzed separately since laser may have systemic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Prwemstay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prwemstay 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Young-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1988</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary endpoints for measurement of effectiveness were the outcome measures recommended by the conference on Outcome Measures for Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-OMERACT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">OMERACT 1993</LINK>) . </P>
<P>These measures include:<BR/>a) Number of tender joints<BR/>b) Number of swollen joints<BR/>c) Pain<BR/>d) Physician global assessment<BR/>e) Patient global assessment<BR/>f) Functional status (for example, measured by the Activities of Daily Living Scale)<BR/>g) Acute phase reactants<BR/>h) Radiological damage</P>
<P>In addition to these outcomes, one of the authors (LB) developed a theoretical framework of important physiotherapy outcomes for the study of LLLT for the treatment of RA (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 1998</LINK>). These outcomes were assessed as secondary endpoints and include:</P>
<P>1) Articular mobility<BR/>2) Muscular testing<BR/>3) Systemic components<BR/>4) Medication usage<BR/>5) Adverse side effects</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:20:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We initially searched MEDLINE up to December, 2001, EMBASE from 1988 to December 2001 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 1998. Details of the search strategy are given in the appendix. The electronic search was complemented by the following hand searches: 1) Bibliographic references; 2) Current Contents up to December 2001 (to identify articles not yet indexed in MEDLINE); 3) Abstracts published in special issues of specialized journals or in Conference Proceedings; 4) Coordinating offices of the trials registries of the Cochrane Field of Physical and Related Therapies and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group were also contacted. This exact search has now been updated to include articles published up until June 2005.</P>
<P>Reference lists were hand-searched for further identification of published work, presentations at scientific meetings and personal communications. Content experts were contacted for additional studies and unpublished data. If data could not be obtained, abstracts were not used.<BR/>The search strategy used is in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The trials retrieved by the above search strategy were assessed independently by two reviewers (LB, RD) according to the selection criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>From each included trial, we collected information regarding the trial design, patient characteristics, dosages and treatment periods, and baseline and end of study outcomes. Data concerning details of the study population, intervention and outcomes were extracted independently by two reviewers (LB, VR). Differences in data extraction were resolved by referring back to the original article and establishing consensus. A third reviewer (BS) was consulted to help resolve differences. </P>
<P>Data on the outcomes from each trial were pooled to arrive at an overall estimate of the effectiveness of laser therapy. Where possible, the analyses were based on intention-to-treat data from the individual clinical trials. </P>
<P>Since laser is thought to have systemic effects, we decided a priori to analyze trials separately depending on whether the control group consisted of a separate group of patients or whether the control group consisted of the patients treated with active laser on one side and sham laser on the other side (contralateral control trials). </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were attempted to determine the effects of the method of LLLT administration, methodological quality and length of treatment on outcomes.</P>
<P>For continuous data, results are presented as a weighted mean difference [WMD]. For dichotomous data, a relative risk (RR) was calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>). A test for heterogeneity was calculated using a Chi square test, with a significance level of p&lt;.05. Fixed effects models were used throughout unless heterogeneity was significant, in which case, a random effects model was used. Publication bias was not assessed due to the small number of included studies.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The initial literature search retrieved 191 articles. Of these, six trials met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bliddal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bliddal 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Palmgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Palmgren 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). Five were randomized controlled trials of laser therapy versus a placebo laser apparatus with a separate control group (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Palmgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Palmgren 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). One used the contralateral joint as the control (<LINK REF="STD-Bliddal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bliddal 1987</LINK>). Five studies were excluded in the initial search: one study was an early abstract of one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1983</LINK>), another lacked a control group(<LINK REF="STD-Asada-K-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Asada K 1989</LINK>), two had insufficient statistical data (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heussler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heussler 1993</LINK>) while the last one was not randomized as indicated by the title of the article (<LINK REF="STD-Oyamada-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Oyamada 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>The updated search to June 2005 identified an additional six potential articles which had to be excluded for the following reasons: three studies were literature reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Ammer-K-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ammer K 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Day-R-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Day R 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-De-Bie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Bie 1998</LINK>), two articles were only available in Russian (<LINK REF="STD-Sidorov-VD-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sidorov VD 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sidorov-VD-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sidorov VD 2000</LINK>), and the final article included patients with juvenile RA (<LINK REF="STD-Fulga-C-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fulga C 1998</LINK>). Moreover, in the initial review, there were also several studies waiting assessment due to a lack of information - either because they were abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Agambar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Agambar 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Matulis--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Matulis 1983</LINK>), or because they were published in German or Japanese (<LINK REF="REF-Barabas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barabas 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miyagi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Miyagi 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taghawinejad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Taghawinejad 1985</LINK>). Letters were sent out at that time to the respective authors to obtain further information. However, the authors did not respond, preventing any further updated assessment by the authors of this review. </P>
<P>Of the included trials, several reported outcomes as graphs. The mean scores and standard deviations were estimated from the graphs. One study presented the logarithm of pain measured on a 10 cm VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). We assumed the logarithm involved the natural exponent and translated these by performing an antilog operation. Another study reported pain on a VAS scale, but then transformed these results to report only 3 categories: laser better than placebo, laser worse than placebo and no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Bliddal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bliddal 1987</LINK>). One study reported end of study scores corrected and uncorrected for disease activity (<LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>). Because randomization is assumed to control for disease activity and other variables, the uncorrected values were used for this meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A total of 204 patients were included in the five placebo-controlled trials, with 112 randomized to laser therapy. For the trial which used the opposite limb as a control, 18 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age ranged from 53 to 67 years and baseline morning stiffness ranged from 60 to 90 minutes. The schedule of treatment was 2-3 sessions per week for 3-4 weeks for all trials except Walker et al 1987 which treated patients for 10 weeks, 3 times per week. All trials included patients with RA of the hands or thumb except Walker et al 1987, which included patients with a diagnosis of RA, but did not specify which joints were affected. The outcomes measured in the included studies were as follows: pain was reported by six trials, functional status by two, range of motion by four, swelling by three, grip strength by three, and morning stiffness by four. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of the included studies was assessed using a validated scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), which includes the appropriateness of randomization, appropriateness of blinding and description of dropouts and withdrawals. Quality was assessed independently by two reviewers (LB, VR). Differences were resolved by consensus. A third reviewer (BS) was consulted when necessary.</P>
<P>The median methodological quality was 3, with a range from 1-5 (Table 1). The individual components of the Jadad score of randomization, blinding and withdrawals are shown in Table 1. Only one trial scored full points for randomization. Five trials scored full points for double-blinding and four trials did not report withdrawals and dropouts. A subgroup analysis was conducted to determine whether the methodological quality influenced the effect of laser by dividing the studies into low and high quality at the median score.</P>
<P>To rank the strength of scientific evidence we used the grading system adopted by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>). This grading system is based on four levels: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. </P>
<P>Platinum: A published systematic review that has at least two individual controlled trials each satisfying the following : <BR/>·Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>·Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>·Handling of withdrawals &gt;80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) are acceptable). <BR/>·Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Gold: At least one randomised clinical trial meeting all of the following criteria for the major outcome(s) as reported: <BR/>·Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>·Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>·Handling of withdrawals &gt; 80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as LOCF are acceptable). <BR/>·Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Silver: A systematic review or randomised trial that does not meet the above criteria. Silver ranking would also include evidence from at least one study of non-randomised cohorts that did and did not receive the therapy, or evidence from at least one high quality case-control study. A randomised trial with a 'head-to-head' comparison of agents would be considered silver level ranking unless a reference were provided to a comparison of one of the agents to placebo showing at least a 20% relative difference. </P>
<P>Bronze: The bronze ranking is given to evidence if at least one high quality case series without controls (including simple before/after studies in which patients act as their own control) or if the conclusion is derived from expert opinion based on clinical experience without reference to any of the foregoing (for example, argument from physiology, bench research or first principles). </P>
<P>For all the outcomes included in this review, a silver level of evidence has been given, mostly because of the small samples size.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Analysis of Trials with a Separate Control Group<BR/>There was no significant heterogeneity for any comparisons, indicating that the difference between treated and control groups was consistent across trials. Each following recommendation has been graded as level silver. Since pain was measured by the visual analogue scale in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>), we used weighted mean differences to pool the end study results and found a statistically significant improvement in pain with a WMD -1.10, (95% CI: -1.82, -0.39). Johannsen 1994 also demonstrated an improvement in pain relief measured this time with a 0-12 scale (<LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>). This improvement was proved by a decrease of 1.00 point (95% CI: 0.23, 1.77) for the laser group relative to the placebo group. We found a clinical relevance of 28%, 25%, 19% and 22% of efficacy respectively for each of these trials. However, Goats 1996 did not find any significant difference in pain relief measured with the McGill pain questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>). Statistically significant improvements were also found for tip to palm flexibility with a difference of 1.3 cm, (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.7 cm) (<LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Palmgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Palmgren 1989</LINK>) and morning stiffness duration with an improvement of 27 minutes, (95% CI: 3 to 52 minutes) (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Palmgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Palmgren 1989</LINK>). For flexibility, we found a clinical relevance of 76% calculated with Johannsen 1994 results and 157% measured by Palmgren 1989 results. Results extracted from Goats 1996, Hall 1994 and Palmgren 1989 trials demonstrated a clinical relevance of 93%, -19% and -78% respectively. Morning stiffness assessed in one trial had an unusually large variance (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>). Excluding this trial, the effect of laser on morning stiffness was still significant and similar in magnitude (difference of 30 minutes, 95% CI: 5.6 to 55 minutes). Also, another trial measured the morning stiffness duration by number of patients who did not improved but did not find a significant relative risk: 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 2.09 ) (<LINK REF="STD-Johannsen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johannsen 1994</LINK>) favouring the laser group relative to the placebo group.</P>
<P>There is conflicting evidence about range of motion. Goats 1996 found a positive effect of laser on knee range of motion after the treatment of this joint supported by a WMD of 31.80 (95% CI: 4.27, 31.80), but no significant difference at the ankle was noted with the same treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>No other outcomes for RA were significantly affected by LLLT. These included functional status, swelling, range of motion (for metacarpal phalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and ankle joints), grip strength, and walking speed.</P>
<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goats-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goats 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>) followed patients after the LLLT was discontinued. Both measured outcomes three months after the end of treatment. These RCTs found no significant differences between LLLT and placebo in any outcome measure at this time point.</P>
<P>For the subgroup analysis regarding methodologic quality, there was no difference between low (&lt;3) and high (=&gt;3) quality for pain reduction at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>For the subgroup analysis regarding joint versus nerve application, only one study applied LLLT to the nerves (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). There was a trend towards greater pain reduction with joint/nerve application compared to joint application, but the confidence intervals for joint application (pain SMD:-0.8 (95% CI: -1.5, -0.2)) overlap those for nerve application (SMD: -1.5 (95% CI: -2.5, -0.6)).</P>
<P>For the subgroup analysis concerning treatment duration, only one trial treated patients for more than 4 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). The results of this analysis did not demonstrate a significant statistical difference with the longer treatment with an SMD for pain at 4 weeks of -0.4 (-0.8, +0.1) and an SMD pain at 10 weeks of -0.7 (-1.2, -0.3).</P>
<P>For the subgroup analysis concerning wavelength, the only outcome with data available for different wavelength comparisons was pain. There were no statistical difference between wavelengths. However, there was a trend for improved outcome with the 632 nm compared to 820 nm for pain although the confidence limits overlap [SMD 632 nm: -0.7 (95% CI: -1.2, -0.3) vs SMD 820 nm: -0.4 (95% CI: -0.8, 0.1)].</P>
<P>For the subgroup analysis concerning dosage, studies using a dosage of less than 3 Joules/cm2 were considered low doses. This subgroup analysis was possible for VAS pain, grip strength and flexibility (tip to palm distance in cm). For pain (VAS), the low dose was significantly better than placebo (SMD: -0.8, 95% CI: -1.2, -0.4). In contrast, high dose studies found no difference between laser and placebo for pain (VAS). There was no dose effect on grip strength and flexibility (tip to palm).</P>
<P>Analysis of Contralateral Control Trials</P>
<P>The trial which used the opposite limb of the same individual as a control did not find any improvement in laser treated hands. There was no significant difference between laser and placebo for pain relief (RR 13.00, 95% CI: 0.79, 214.06). Less than half of the subjects found the lasered hand improved compared to the placebo treated hand. Relative to baseline, most patients reported similar or no changes in both laser and placebo treated hands. Specifically, the number of patients who reported this result were 11 out of 17 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bliddal-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bliddal 1987</LINK>). There was no difference in morning stiffness, mobility joint neither in laboratory tests. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In RA, this meta-analysis suggests that LLLT is effective at reducing pain relative to placebo and reducing morning stiffness. However, according to Lineker et al. 1999, duration of morning stiffness has a poor sensitivity to be considered as an outcome measure of morning stiffness (<LINK REF="REF-Lineker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lineker 1999</LINK>). Being as morning stiffness is related to various other conditions, such as OA, it is not possible to make the difference between two conditions by comparing the duration. Definition of morning stiffness should be more specific to RA. The results show no statistical improvements for any of the following: localized swelling, muscle strength, functional status, joint tenderness or global assessments with laser treatment. </P>
<P>The major limitation of this meta-analysis is the heterogeneity of clinical application, including different dosages, wavelengths and types of LLLT. In addition, the results are subject to publication bias, if negative trials are not published. Furthermore, the treated joints in all but one of the RA trials were hand joints, and these results may not be generalized to other treatment sites due to different penetrations and dosages.</P>
<P>The possible systemic effects of laser use may be the key to understanding the improvement on pain scales. Although much of the source of inflammatory pain is peripheral (i.e., joint capsule, ligament, muscle and skin), it is within the central nervous system (CNS) that perception and interpretation of pain occurs, and particularly long-standing pain for RA (<LINK REF="REF-Coderre-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coderre 1993</LINK>). Perhaps laser irradiation positively modifies the sensory input to the CNS and provides an improvement in the perception of pain localized to the area of treatment. It has been well demonstrated that a painful stimulus in one extremity has a contralateral effect (<LINK REF="REF-Coderre-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coderre 1993</LINK>). The improved pain scores contralaterally in the studied trial provide clinical evidence of CNS involvement. Although there is not a sufficient number of studies to support this idea, the trend towards greater pain reduction when nerves as well as joints were irradiated in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>, suggests that this treatment strategy should be explored to support CNS input theory. </P>
<P>The results suggest that improvement in overall pain relative to controls followed LLLT applied at local sites including the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and knee joints. Other work on the histologic evaluation of rheumatoid synovial membrane has shown that inflammatory changes present in the damaged synovial membrane can be reversed. Exposure to LLLT has been shown to result in: 1) anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Barabas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barabas 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Matulis--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Matulis 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nishida-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishida 1990</LINK>); 2) increased protein synthesis of rheumatoid synovial cells (Goldman 1980) , 3) normalization of the permeability of the synovial membrane (<LINK REF="STD-Tsurko-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Tsurko 1983</LINK>) and 4) enhancement of regional microcirculation (<LINK REF="STD-Matulis--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Matulis 1983</LINK>). According to Goldman 1980, the laser energy irradiates inflamed synovial cells and modifies the level of antigen-antibody complexes and helps stabilize the membranes in RA subjects(<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1980</LINK>). These processes support the hypothesis that LLLT has systemic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Prwemstay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prwemstay 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Young-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1988</LINK>). Several investigators have recently called for further investigation to establish that key histologic changes can be captured with our clinical measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results in this meta-analysis suggest that LLLT does not have long-lasting effects. In this review, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>) had a treatment duration greater than four weeks. Support for a time-related effect of LLLT comes from animal model studies. Schultz and collaborators noted, in a pig in vitro cartilage model, that only after the fourth week of LLLT irradiation, a joint regeneration process began which they hypothesized to be a reactivation of the mitotic control mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1985</LINK>). Furthermore, the healing of the joint surface lesion was not complete until the end of 6 weeks of application. </P>
<P>The subgroup analyses for dosage, wavelength and site of application indicated no significant effects of these factors on the effectiveness of LLLT in RA. However, these subgroup analyses indicated trends towards improved outcomes with longer dose duration, nerve application and shorter wavelengths. Even though there is more evidence that wavelengths not only determine penetration depth, but also specific tissue interactions (<LINK REF="REF-Bolagni-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolagni 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Karu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karu 1987</LINK>). Our results do not appear to support this hypothesis. According to Seichert 1991, the wavelength effect of the two most commonly used lasers, HeNe and GaAlAs lasers, is negligible. Furthermore, ''the laser light loses its coherency completely after only a few tenths of millimeters in depth'' (<LINK REF="REF-Seichert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seichert 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of the dosages in these RCTs did not reveal a relationship between the dosage and the outcomes of interest. The dosages were calculated by hand since they were not consistently reported in the articles. As previously stated, this situation shows that uniformity in reporting the dosages used is imperative (<LINK REF="REF-Morin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morin 1996</LINK>). The large variability in methodological quality reflects the need for standardization of conducting and reporting clinical trials in physiotherapy. In this meta-analysis, we were only able to pool certain outcomes, such as pain, morning stiffness and range of motion. The use of validated clinical measurements sensitive enough to detect changes is also needed (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1993</LINK>). There is an urgent need for further well designed RCTs evaluating different durations of treatment, nerve versus joint application, different wavelengths and different dosages. Further clinical hypothesis could be investigated for each of these aspects. </P>
<P>The development and use of a theoretical framework to rationalize LLLT and also to report LLLT application in clinical settings and in scientific reports is imperative (<LINK REF="REF-Calderhead-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calderhead 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rothstein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothstein 1991</LINK>) There is also a need for evaluation of standardized OMERACT outcomes, including joint count and physician and patient global assessment with laser treatment for RA. These outcomes are recognized as responsive to changes in RA status. </P>
<P>Several authors recommend further studies to elucidate the effectiveness of LLLT for RA (<LINK REF="REF-Beckerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckerman 1992</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-King-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1990</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Quirion_x002d_DeGirardi-94" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quirion-DeGirardi 94</LINK>). These studies are needed to contribute to evidence-based practice.</P>
<P>In summary, LLLT for RA is beneficial as a minimum of a four-week treatment with reductions in pain and morning stiffness. On the one hand, this meta-analysis found that pooled data gave some evidence of a clinical effect, but the outcomes were in conflict, and it must therefore be concluded that firm documentation of the application of LLLT in RA is not possible. Conversely, a possible clinical benefit in certain subgroups cannot be ruled out from the present meta-analysis and further large-scale studies are recommended with special attention to the findings in this meta-analysis (e.g. low versus high dose, wavelength, nerve versus joint application and treatment duration).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>According to this meta-analysis, there is ''silver'' level of evidence that low level laser therapy decreases pain and morning stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if applied for at least 4 weeks. No side effects were reported. However, we conclude that there is insufficient data to draw firm conclusions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further RCTs evaluating different lengths of treatment, nerve vs joint application, different wavelengths and different dosages.</P>
<P>There is a need for evaluation of other OMERACT outcomes including joint count and physician and patient global assessment with laser treatment for RA. These outcomes are recognized as responsive to changes in RA status.</P>
