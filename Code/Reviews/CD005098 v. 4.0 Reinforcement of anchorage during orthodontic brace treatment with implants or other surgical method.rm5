<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-04 11:17:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to assess the effects of using implants surgically placed in bone in the mouth in order to stabilise (anchor) teeth during treatment with orthodontic braces and compares implants with the use of conventional methods. It also assesses the effects of different surgical anchorage techniques.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Orthodontic treatment is used to correct crooked or sticking out teeth by moving the affected teeth into the correct position. The teeth are straightened by using a brace. Sometimes unwanted movement of other teeth is caused by the use of a brace and this is controlled by what is known as anchorage, or methods for stabilising these teeth. Conventionally anchorage sites are inside the mouth (intraoral) using teeth for example, or alternatively from outside the mouth (extraoral) using headgear devices attached to the head or neck. Sometimes when devices such as headgear are used there are issues with patients being reluctant to wear them, or they have been reported to cause injuries.</P>
<P>As an alternative to these conventional methods, surgical techniques have been developed to put mini-screws or other types of implants into bone in the mouth to provide a firm structure for anchorage (stabilisation) to prevent the unwanted movement of teeth during orthodontic treatments.</P>
<P>These types of devices have become increasingly popular, however their effects have not been fully evaluated.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 28 October 2013. This is an update to an existing review, which included one study. Fifteen studies were included in this review involving data from 561 participants.<I> </I>The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. Most took place in university settings or training hospitals and one in a specialist orthodontic practice. Most studies contained a similar number of males and females, however there were more females than males in five studies and only females in two. The age range varied from adolescents and young adults to adults up to the age of 54 years. All participants in the studies needed a course of orthodontic treatment with additional anchorage control. None of the studies reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>When surgically implanted anchorage devices were compared to conventional anchorage devices, they were better in providing stabilisation for preventing unwanted movement in teeth during orthodontic treatment. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and how acceptable the devices were found to be. No information was reported on adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the important outcomes in this review ranged from moderate to low quality. The main shortcomings of all of the studies were related to issues with their design and the way they were carried out, with insufficient and low quality reporting of the study methods and outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-04 10:50:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The term anchorage in orthodontic treatment refers to methods of controlling unwanted tooth movement. This is provided either by anchor sites within the mouth, such as the teeth and the palate, or from outside the mouth (headgear). Recently, new methods of providing anchorage have been developed using orthodontic implants which are surgically inserted into the bone in the mouth. This is termed surgical anchorage. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-08-04 10:56:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>To assess the effects of surgical anchorage techniques compared to conventional anchorage in the prevention of unwanted tooth movement in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment by evaluating the mesiodistal movement of upper first molar teeth. A secondary objective was to compare the effects of one type of surgical anchorage with another.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-04 10:58:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane</I> <I>Library</I> 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 28 October 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 October 2013). We handsearched key international orthodontic and dental journals, and searched the trial database ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing and unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-10-31 11:03:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage in orthodontic patients. Trials comparing two types of surgical anchorage were also included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-04 10:59:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>At least two review authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessments. We contacted study authors to clarify aspects of study design and conduct, and to obtain unreported data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-04 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Fourteen new studies were added in this update resulting in a total of 15 studies reporting data from 561 randomised patients. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and females was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. </P>
<P>Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; six studies at unclear risk of bias; one study at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>Ten studies with 407 randomised and 390 analysed patients compared surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome of mesiodistal movement of upper first molars. We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies that fully reported this outcome. There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical anchorage on this outcome. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies, 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies, 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. </P>
<P>When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another.</P>
<P>No included studies reported adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-01 09:42:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising. While surgical anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear, none of the included studies reported on harms of surgical or conventional anchorage.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-04 16:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-04 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-04 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Many children and adolescents present for orthodontic treatment with crooked or prominent teeth. Treatment to align the teeth is conventionally provided using fixed orthodontic appliances, with the extraction of teeth and the use of either an intra- or extraoral appliance to provide support to the molar teeth (anchorage reinforcement) as the fixed appliance aligns the anterior teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anchorage in orthodontics is defined as the prevention of unwanted tooth movement. Traditionally this may be provided from anchor sites within the mouth (intraoral anchorage) or from outside the mouth (extraoral anchorage) (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2001</LINK>). Intraoral anchor sites include teeth or other oral structures. Extraoral anchorage is achieved with headgear, using the back of the head or the neck.</P>
<P>Intraoral anchorage can be supplemented by securing teeth together by means of metal wires, such as transpalatal arches or lingual arches. Anchorage may also be supplemented by using elastic traction to the opposing arch. This is termed intermaxillary anchorage (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>While extraoral anchorage may be a more effective method of preventing anchor tooth movement than intraoral methods, there are concerns about patient compliance with headgear (<LINK REF="REF-Cureton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cureton 1993</LINK>) and issues over patient safety. For example, Samuels has described a range of soft tissue and eye injuries associated with headgear (<LINK REF="REF-Samuels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 1996</LINK>). In a few cases this has resulted in the loss of an eye (<LINK REF="REF-Booth_x002d_Mason-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth-Mason 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 1996</LINK>). A related Cochrane systematic review has assessed the effects of conventional distalis ing appliances developed to overcome the limitations of headgear (<LINK REF="REF-Jambi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jambi 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another method of reinforcing anchorage has been developed using surgical techniques. For example, Gainsforth and Higley suggested the use of metallic screws as anchors as long ago as 1945 (<LINK REF="REF-Gainsforth-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gainsforth 1945</LINK>). Melsen experimented with anchorage from wires passed through the zygomatic arch in cases where posterior teeth were absent or of poor quality (<LINK REF="REF-Melsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melsen 1998</LINK>). A recent development has been the modification of dental implants in which devices are surgically inserted into the alveolar bone where they become osseointegrated (<LINK REF="REF-Kanomi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanomi 1997</LINK>). This new technique could have an important role in orthodontic treatment as it may offer the possibility of circumventing most of the shortcomings of traditional anchorage methods.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-04 11:19:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>All surgical techniques for reinforcing anchorage use the bone as the anchor site, which is considered a solid, stable structure. Types of surgical anchorage include mini-screw implants, mini-plates and mid-palatal implants (<LINK REF="REF-Prabhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhu 2006</LINK>). The mini-screw implant is a modification of screws used for fixation of maxillofacial fractures. Although they have varying lengths and diameters, they are generally smaller than maxillofacial fixation screws hence the term 'mini'. Another type of implant is placed in the bone in the middle of the palate and these are called mid-palatal implants.</P>
<P>Both these types of implants can be placed by the orthodontist or the oral surgeon. The anchorage device can be placed before the start of treatment, at the beginning or during the space closure phase of treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-04 11:20:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>As the surgical anchorage device is fixed to the bone it is proposed that it provides a stable point from which anchorage can be provided. The implants provide stability either by mechanical retention (mini-plates), osseointegration (mid-palatal implants), or both (mini-screw implants) (<LINK REF="REF-Prabhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhu 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-04 11:25:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The two most common conventional methods of providing anchorage reinforcement have been headgear and palatal arches. Surgical anchorage has the following potential advantages over conventional anchorage reinforcement.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Active compliance by the wearer is eliminated.</LI>
<LI>Surgical appliances are not associated with the injuries that can result from wearing conventional anchorage appliances.</LI>
<LI>Absolute anchorage may be provided.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Recently the use of surgical anchorage has become increasingly popular with what may be considered to be lack of high level evidence to underpin its use. A systematic review with formal quality assessment to standardised criteria is needed to evaluate the effects of these types of surgical anchorage techniques. </P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.</P>

<P>We developed and piloted a more detailed data extraction form for use in this update. It contained information on methods, participants, interventions, primary and secondary outcomes and reported results. Data extraction was performed independently and in duplicate by three review authors. One form was used as the master form and any additions were added to it as appropriate.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-04 11:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the potential bias of the studies. This was done independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. We investigated six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of the outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias'. Blinding of patients and operators was considered unfeasible due to the nature of the interventions, however there was potential for assessment and detection bias.</P>
<P>For selective reporting we considered both selective reporting of outcomes and selective reporting of study data. Where the primary outcome of this review was not reported but could reasonably have been expected to be recorded and reported then the study was judged to be at high risk of bias for this domain. Where the protocol of the primary study was not available then the study was judged to be at unclear risk of bias because of the uncertainty about reporting all intended outcomes. Selective reporting of study data, such as incomplete reporting of summary statistics, was considered high risk only in relation to the primary outcome. The overall judgement on risk of bias in this domain was given according to the highest risk of bias identified.</P>
<P>For each study, each domain was assessed as being at low, high or unclear risk of bias as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>Version 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Additional information provided by the authors of the primary studies was taken into account where appropriate. A risk of bias table was completed for each included study. These results were also presented graphically.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias for each study was assessed as follows: low risk of bias if all domains were low, unclear if one or more was unclear, and high if one or more domain was high.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect was expressed as risk ratio (RR); for continuous outcomes, the estimate of effect was expressed as the mean difference (MD) if studies reported an outcome using the same scales or standardised mean difference (SMD) if studies reported an outcome using different scales. The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated alongside the effect estimate. Where insufficient information was reported to enable these effect measures to be calculated a narrative report of the summary measures was provided.</P>

The I<SUP>2</SUP> values range from 0% (may not be important) to 100% (considerable heterogeneity).

Four of these studies measure anchorage loss as a primary outcome; it is not clear if the remaining study measures this outcome as part of assessing treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2009</LINK>). Secondary outcomes include success of the anchorage device, peer assessment rating (PAR) index, American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) scores, patient perception, treatment process, soft tissue health, root resorption, bone quality, amount of extraction space closure, angle classification of canines and parallelism of the dental axis.</P>

The conventional anchorage methods included headgear, transpalatal arches, banding of second molars, and application of differential moments. There was strong evidence in favour of surgical anchorage on this outcome, with an overall mean difference (MD) of -1.68 mm in molar movement (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 to -1.09). There was a substantial amount of heterogeneity (Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.44; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 27.37, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value &lt; 0.001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%). The range of effects within the confidence interval comprised only beneficial effects of surgical anchorage that were of clinical importance. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the high level of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We then analysed the data according to type of surgical intervention. For mid-palatal implants (three studies, 190 patients analysed) there was an overall MD of -1.02 mm in molar movement favouring surgical anchorage (95% CI -2.31 to 0.26; Tau<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.99; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 10.71, df = 2, P value = 0.005; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 81%); for the mini-screw implants (four studies, 118 patients analysed) there was an overall MD of -2.17 mm in molar movement favouring surgical intervention (95% CI -2.58 to -1.77; Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.06; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 4.32, df = 3, P value = 0.23; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30%).</P>
<P>There was some evidence of a difference in effect according to subgroup (P value = 0.09), with a greater and more precise effect estimate for the meta-analysis of mini-screw implants than the mid-palatal implants. Moreover, there was greater consistency of results for the mini-screw subgroup with all included trials showing evidence of a favourable effect of mini-screws.</P>
<P>We were unable to include three studies in the meta-analysis due to incomplete reporting of this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Basha-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Basha 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddalone-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Maddalone 2010</LINK>).

The number of successes, the definition of success and the types of anchorage devices used in each of these studies are summarised in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Due to the variability in the definition of this outcome measure and incomplete outcome reporting we did not pool the results of these studies.</P>
<P>Two studies provided complete data comparing the success of surgical anchorage to that of conventional anchorage (<LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmann 2007</LINK>). The results of these studies were not pooled due to substantial clinical differences in the definitions of success of the anchorage devices but are reported as a narrative (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In the first study (47 patients analysed), the success of the anchorage device was high in both study arms, with a 91% success rate for surgical anchorage and 88% success rate for conventional anchorage (<LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK>). With surgical anchorage (Orthosystem mid-palatal) reasons for failures were: failure after orthodontic loading, patients did not end up with implant-assisted anchorage. With conventional anchorage (headgear) reasons for failures were: patients did not end up with headgear, or headgear did not provide sufficient anchorage. In the second study (118 patients analysed) the proportion of successful outcomes was greater in the combined surgical anchorage groups than in the combined conventional anchorage groups (<LINK REF="STD-Feldmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmann 2007</LINK>). Reasons for failure with surgical anchorage (Nobel Biocare onplants and Orthosystem implants) were: failure of osseointegration, technical problems with the implants, discontinuation of treatment due to poor oral hygiene, and anchorage loss more than 1 mm.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration of active treatment</HEADING>
<P>The duration of the complete course of orthodontic treatment was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borsos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Borsos 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>) with 111 analysed patients. The mean duration of active treatment was reported differently in the three studies: in days (<LINK REF="STD-Borsos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Borsos 2012</LINK>), months (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009</LINK>), and years (<LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK>). Results of a fixed-effect model meta-analysis of overall treatment time (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) indicated that the treatment time was 0.25 standard units shorter on average with surgical anchorage than with conventional anchorage (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25; 95% CI -0.62 to 0.12 ). Heterogeneity was negligible for this comparison (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.63, df = 2, P value = 0.73; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). We re-expressed the SMD in years using the summary standard deviations of the Chesterfield study for interpretation; overall treatment time was 0.15 years shorter with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage (95% CI -0.37 to 0.07). The range of effects contained within the confidence interval included both no effect of the intervention and some effect. There was not strong evidence that surgical anchorage reduced treatment time compared with conventional anchorage.</P>

There was a moderate amount of heterogeneity for this outcome (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 3.64, df = 2, P value = 0.16; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 45%). We re-expressed the SMD in days using the summary standard deviations of the <LINK REF="STD-Borsos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Borsos 2012</LINK> study for interpretation: time to space closure was 12 days shorter with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage (95% CI -72 to 47).

This did not include the time taken for surgical placement and osseointegration of the mid-palatal implants. The mean number of visits required to complete orthodontic treatment was 26.21 (SD 7.41) for surgical anchorage and 19.2 (SD 4.58) for conventional anchorage.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Patient-reported pain during anaesthetic injection, following surgery or extraction, in the evening after surgery or extraction and one week following surgery or extraction in relation to the anchorage device was reported by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Feldmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmann 2007</LINK>). The results of the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain are summarised in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. "The first evening after the intervention, groups A (surgical anchorage) (P value = 0.002) and C (conventional anchorage) (P value = 0.007) had significantly more pain intensity compared to group B (surgical anchorage). The difference in pain intensity between onplant installation and premolar extraction was not significant. One week after the interventions, pain intensity was still significantly higher in group C (conventional anchorage) compared to group B (surgical anchorage) who had undergone installation of an Orthosystem implant (P value = 0.001). Differences between groups A (surgical anchorage) and B (surgical anchorage) were not significant."</P>
<P>Self reported questionnaires assessing patient-reported pain on a VAS from 0 to 100 were also administered throughout the orthodontic treatment (from start of treatment until the first visit after retention). Pain in the three anchorage groups peaked on day 2 after the start of treatment. Values for medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were as follows: 46.0 (IQR 16.0 to 76.5) for the surgical anchorage group, 43.8 (IQR 14.3 to 62.3) for headgear, and 57.0 (IQR 34.5 to 72) for palatal arches.</P>

<P>When discomfort was assessed in relation to placement of the anchorage device (<LINK REF="STD-Feldmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmann 2007</LINK>) the results followed a similar pattern to the pain assessed in the same study. The most severe discomfort was experienced on the evening after surgery with the Nobel-Biocare onplants (median 33, IQR 0 to 96) and the evening after extractions (median 21, IQR 0 to 88). There was still a degree of discomfort with the Orthosystem mid-palatal implants the evening after surgery (median 14, IQR 0 to 98), however the most severe discomfort experienced with this type of anchorage was during the anaesthetic injection (median 22, IQR 0 to 96). The results of the VAS for discomfort are summarised in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>Discomfort was also assessed throughout orthodontic treatment on self reported questionnaires that assessed discomfort on a VAS from 0 to 100. Discomfort, expressed as tension from jaws and teeth and soreness from the appliance, in the three anchorage groups peaked on day 2 (no data reported).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK> study, patients randomised to receive implants were asked to indicate through a self reported questionnaire the grade they would assign to the surgery from 1 (totally comfortable) to 6 (very uncomfortable), immediately after implant placement and on removal of the implant: "75% of the respondents scored between 4 and 6 - i.e. at the comfortable end of the scale for implant placement - and no patient scored 1 indicating that the placement of implants was generally acceptable." These results were repeated over the first three days. On implant removal "40% scored 5, 40% scored 3, and 20% scored 1, indicating that implant removal was slightly less comfortable than implant placement."</P>

In terms of the impact of orthodontic treatment on the patient's mood and appearance the study further reported "Assessment of how much orthodontic treatment affected the patient's mood and appearance peaked at the first rescheduled visit after 6 weeks (overall median = 14.0; median = 99.0) and with no differences between groups."</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-04 12:46:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>This is a substantial update with an additional 14 studies added to the single study of the initial review published in 2007.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of surgical anchorage to conventional anchorage</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mesiodistal movement of upper molar teeth</HEADING>
<P>The last published version of this review included only one study and the results were inconclusive. The small amount of information available to compare surgical anchorage (a single study of surgical anchorage using a mid-palatal implant) with conventional anchorage did not indicate that the mesiodistal movement of the upper first permanent molar differed in the two groups.</P>
<P>The results from this updated review indicate that there is some evidence that surgical methods of reinforcing orthodontic anchorage are more effective than conventional methods such as headgear and other intraoral devices in reinforcing anchorage during orthodontic brace treatment. The pooled mean difference in mesiodistal movement was 1.68 mm and whilst this difference may seem small it is clinically significant. This is also important when we consider that there are published reports of risk with the use of extraoral devices. As a result, the use of surgical anchorage has clear advantages over other methods of reinforcing anchorage.</P>
<P>Since the development of the protocol for this review current practice has moved towards the adoption of specific types of surgical anchorage, the most common of which is the mini-screw implant. Hence a post hoc subgroup analysis was undertaken to further investigate the effects of different individual types of surgical anchorage, mid-palatal implants and mini-screw implants. Whilst the overall effects favoured surgical anchorage for both subgroups, the mean difference in mesiodistal movement was smaller, and thus more favourable, for mini-screw implants than conventional anchorage (headgear and palatal arches).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The effects on the secondary outcomes of the review were less certain due to limited reporting of these outcomes and variability in the clinical definitions of outcomes, which precluded synthesis. Both methods of anchorage were successful. There was not strong evidence that surgical anchorage reduced treatment time or duration of space closure when compared to conventional anchorage. There was very little evidence on patient-reported outcomes such as pain, discomfort and acceptability. Importantly, no studies reported on residual overjet at the end of treatment, adverse effects and economic factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of two types of surgical anchorage</HEADING>
<P>The direct comparisons of surgical interventions were from two small studies of early and delayed loading of the same mini-screw implants, two studies comparing pre-drilling and self drilling mini-screw implants, and one study comparing single and dual mini-screw implants. Results from these studies did not indicate that the proportion of successes were different between these pairwise comparisons of surgical interventions. </P>
<P>Only one study reported on the primary outcome of movement of the upper first molar in a mesial or distal direction, and no studies reported on residual overjet at the end of treatment. One study reported on the duration of space closure. The number of visits, acceptability, economic factors and adverse effects were not reported in any of the studies.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-04 12:48:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The primary objective of the review was to assess the effects of surgical anchorage techniques compared to conventional anchorage in the prevention of unwanted tooth movement in orthodontic patients, by evaluating the mesiodistal movement of upper first molar teeth. Ten studies, conducted principally in a dental hospital setting, in locations across Europe, Asia and the USA contributed information to the evaluation of this outcome. Participants were adolescents and younger and older adults. The overall risk of bias for the included studies was high or unclear, with only one study assessed as at low risk of bias. The pooled estimate of effect showed a mean difference in favour of surgical anchorage, which was of clinical importance. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the associated high level of heterogeneity of the pooled studies and the inclusion of only mini-screw and mid-palatal implants as surgical interventions.</P>
<P>A secondary objective was to compare the effects of one type of surgical anchorage with another. This was assessed in five studies where applicability of the evidence to the review question was good. The overall risk of bias for the included studies was high or unclear. The surgical interventions were diverse and this precluded the calculation of a pooled estimate of effect.</P>
<P>Whilst the updated review comprised 15 included studies the amount of information contributing to the primary and secondary outcomes varied substantially. Hence only the effects of the primary outcome mesiodistal movement for surgical anchorage techniques compared to conventional anchorage techniques can be estimated with any degree of certainty. The implications of this finding are discussed further in the sections <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for practice</LINK> and <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>.</P>

</P>
<P>The body of evidence reporting the primary outcome was moderate according to the GRADE approach due to limitations in the design and conduct of the studies. One study was at low risk of bias and one was at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding of outcome assessment. A further two were at an unclear risk of bias because we could not locate the protocol of the primary study leading to uncertainty in the reporting of all intended outcomes; all other risk of bias domains were at low risk of bias in these two studies. The remaining studies were at an unclear risk of bias mainly because the concealment of the allocation sequence was not reported.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the additional outcome of duration of treatment as low due to limitations in design, the conduct of the studies, and to imprecision of results from the two small studies providing data for this outcome.</P>
<P>We assessed the studies in this review as having varying risks of bias. The evidence for the main outcomes of mesiodistal movement, duration of treatment and adverse events were from studies at overall high and unclear risks of bias. Only one small study was assessed to have an overall low risk of bias. No information on the remaining outcome, adverse events, was reported. </P>
<P>Selective reporting was evident for many of the included studies as expected cephalometric and clinical outcomes were not reported or were reported incompletely. Where possible, we contacted the authors for additional information on aspects of study design or outcome data. Any additional information that was obtained was included in the review.</P>
<P>Orthodontic treatment is a long and sometimes painful process. The number of studies reporting patient-reported outcomes of relevance to the review, such as pain and acceptability, was small and the quality of the reported outcomes was poor. This is a definite limitation of the review.</P>

<P>The results of this review are in agreement with other systematic reviews on the topic, which have less rigorous methodology. The inclusion criteria for these reviews have often allowed a large variation in study design, including retrospective studies. These reviews either assessed a variety of surgical anchorage devices or were specifically interested in mini-screw implants. The most common outcome that was investigated in these reviews was the success or failure of the anchorage device, followed by anchorage loss (molar movement). Mini-screw implants were found to have success rates of 83.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Crismani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crismani 2010</LINK>), 87.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 2011</LINK>), 86.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Papageorgiou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papageorgiou 2012</LINK>) and 61% to 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Tsui-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsui 2012</LINK>). Mini-plates and palatal implants had success rates of 91.4% to 100% and 74% to 93.3%, respectively. In addition, the <LINK REF="REF-Li-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2011</LINK> review reported more distal movement with the mid-palatal implants, onplants and mini-screw implants. Reported anchorage loss was in agreement with this review. The mean difference in distal molar movement favoured mini-screw implants over conventional anchorage in the <LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 2011</LINK> review (MD -2.4 mm; 95% confidence interval -2.9 to -1.8).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-04 12:52:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The last published version of this review included a single study and concluded that the objectives of the review were not met because little evidence was identified for assessment. It was also suggested that mid-palatal implants may be an acceptable alternative to headgear reinforced anchorage in orthodontic anchorage.</P>
<P>From this update there is some evidence of moderate quality to suggest that surgical anchorage is more effective than conventional anchorage in the reinforcement of anchorage during orthodontic brace treatment, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising. Importantly, surgical anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to headgear. There was no evidence of a difference in duration of treatment between surgical and conventional anchorage.</P>
<P>When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-04 16:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Current evidence on the effectiveness of surgical anchorage is based on randomised trials with varying levels of bias. In particular, methods to reduce the potential for selection bias should be undertaken and reported. Only two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldmann 2007</LINK>) reported calculating the sample size. Future research should ensure that an adequate sample size is achieved.</P>
<P>A wide age range of patients could possibly benefit from surgical anchorage. However, including a wide age range in a single study is discouraged because it is known that growing patients respond differently to orthodontic treatment when compared to non-growing patients. In addition, studies should address both patient and clinician acceptability of the surgical appliances as important changes to policies can be made as a result of such trials. These could include adding this type of treatment to the syllabus of training orthodontists or providing this treatment as part of government or insured health care or both.</P>
<P>Outcomes should consider an appropriate start and endpoint to measure molar movement as a function of assessing orthodontic anchorage. It was difficult to agree an appropriate endpoint for measurement of anchorage loss before undertaking the review; a decision was made to use the most common endpoint(s). Anchorage control is required in all phases of orthodontic treatment and this was reflected in the endpoints reported in the studies of this review. Points at which anchorage loss was measured included at the end of the levelling and alignment phase, the end of space closure (including or excluding the previous alignment phase or both), the end of anchorage (when the anchorage device was no longer needed) and the end of treatment. A consensus on the most important endpoint could possibly be achieved by conducting qualitative research; this could be part of an overall design to reach a consensus on outcomes relevant to anchorage devices. Important considerations would be the clinical relevance of the endpoint, an occasion when the biggest difference is likely to occur, or the objectivity of the endpoint or both. For example, choosing 'end of anchorage' as an endpoint is likely to be the point where maximum movement of the molars is achieved, however it is a somewhat subjective time point. Conversely, the end of treatment is a more objective time point however, the effects of the anchorage devices may be neutralised or further reinforced in an attempt to achieve the ideal occlusion at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Studies should also focus on relevant outcomes rather than reporting routine cephalometric analysis. Studies included in this review and the ongoing studies have reported a variety of relevant outcomes. A single study would need large resources and adequate time to investigate all relevant outcomes and time points, therefore it is recommended that consensus be reached on the most important outcomes and how they may be investigated and reported. Areas for research include determining the best size and shape of the implant as well as the type of material to use. Other areas of comparison are immediate versus delayed, and static versus dynamic loading. It is also important to assess patient perception and acceptability. Appropriate outcomes from such research should include anchorage loss, failure rates, financial costs, assessment of discomfort and related quality of life issues. The outcome of success poses a particular challenge when comparing surgical and conventional anchorage. This was previously discussed in a related Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jambi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jambi 2013</LINK>). It is difficult to find a definition for success that applies to both surgical and conventional anchorage. The recommendation is to define success according to treatment objectives. For example, an appliance would be successful in orthodontic anchorage if it achieves at least no loss of anchorage (0 mm molar movement) or gain of anchorage (distal molar movement).</P>

<P>The inclusion criteria were changed as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Quasi-randomised studies were no longer eligible for the review.</LI>
<LI>To coincide with recent advancements in measurement techniques, studies in which measurements were made on superimposed digital models were also considered eligible for the review.</LI>
<LI>The electronic search strategy was amended by the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator to include additional terms (endosseous, temporary anchorage device, TAD, orthodontic anchorage procedures).</LI>
<LI>The handsearch was expanded to include relevant journals on oral implants.</LI>
<LI>The search for unpublished studies was expanded to include trial registries.</LI>
<LI>Subgroup analysis was carried out to further investigate the effects of different types of surgical anchorage. This was a post hoc analysis as we did not expect to find multiple trials investigating surgical anchorage.</LI>

This was repeated five times. In practice, this means that you have to wait until six patients are collected - meeting the inclusion criteria and are willing to participate in the study. As every patient, taken up to our Department, also the participants got a card number, when he first presented themselves. At the randomisation one will be drawn from the 20 possible blocks (closed envelopes), in all of which the two (A and B) groups are represented equally. The selected block would be assigned to the patients based on their card sequence number. (For example: we have six patients with card numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12 and block 4 (AABBA) is selected &#8211; than patient 2, 4, 12 are candidates in group A and patient 6, 7, 9 in group B)"</P>
