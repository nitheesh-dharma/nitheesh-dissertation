<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Strong evidence that advanced and remedial driver education does not reduce road traffic crashes or injuries</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury worldwide. As drivers' errors are a factor often contributing to traffic crashes, driver education is often used in the belief that this makes drivers safer. Driver education for licensed drivers can be remedial programmes for those with poor driving records, or advanced courses for drivers generally. They can be offered by correspondence, in groups or with individualised training. The review of trials found strong evidence that no type of driver education for licensed drivers leads to a reduction in traffic crashes or injuries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Worldwide, each year over a million people are killed and some ten million people are permanently disabled in road traffic crashes. Post-licence driver education is used by many as a strategy to reduce traffic crashes. However, the effectiveness of post-licence driver education has yet to be ascertained.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the effectiveness of post-licence driver education in reducing road traffic crashes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-04-25 16:44:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, TRANSPORT (NTIS, TRIS, TRANSDOC, IRRD), Road Res (ARRB), ATRI, National Research Register, PsycInfo, ERIC, C2-SPECTR, Zetoc, SIGLE, Science (and Social Science) Citation Index. We searched the Internet, checked reference lists of relevant papers and contacted appropriate organisations. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The search was last updated in October 2005. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing post-licence driver education versus no education, or one form of post-licence driver education versus another.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed methodological trial quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-04-25 14:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found 24 trials of driver education, 23 conducted in the USA and one in Sweden.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Twenty trials studied remedial driver education. The methodological quality of the trials was poor and three reported data unsuitable for meta-analysis.<BR/>Nineteen trials reported traffic offences: pooled relative risk (RR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.94, 0.98); trial heterogeneity was significant (p=&lt;0.00001).<BR/>Fifteen trials reported traffic crashes: pooled RR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.96, 1.01), trial heterogeneity was not significant (p=0.75).<BR/>Four trials reported injury crashes: pooled RR = 1.12 (95% CI 0.88, 1.41), trial heterogeneity was significant (p=&lt;0.00001).</P>
<P>No one form of education (correspondence, group or individual) was found to be substantially more effective than another, nor was a significant difference found between advanced driver education and remedial driver education. Funnel plots indicated the presence of publication bias affecting the traffic offence and crash outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review provides no evidence that post-licence driver education is effective in preventing road traffic injuries or crashes. Although the results are compatible with a small reduction in the occurrence of traffic offences, this may be due to selection biases or bias in the included trials. Because of the large number of participants included in the meta-analysis (close to 300,000 for some outcomes) we can exclude, with reasonable precision, the possibility of even modest benefits. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-19 15:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-19 15:39:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Worldwide, each year over a million people are killed and some ten million people are permanently disabled in road traffic crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). For people under 44 years, road traffic crashes are now a leading cause of death and disablement, second only to HIV and AIDS as a cause of death. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the global epidemic of road traffic injuries is only beginning. Many developing countries are at low levels of motorisation and rates of road traffic injuries can be expected to rise with increasing vehicle use. By 2020, road traffic injuries will, it is estimated, have moved from ninth to third in the world ranking of disease burden (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-19 15:40:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because driver error is a factor in the causation of road traffic crashes, great emphasis has been placed in road safety strategies on efforts to reduce driver error through driver education programmes. Promoting post-licence driver education, enhancing the status of advanced driving qualifications, and encouraging extra training for professional drivers, are key components of the UK government's Road Safety Strategy (<LINK REF="REF-DETR-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DETR 2000</LINK>). Because many people drive as part of their job, traffic crashes have become a leading cause of occupational injury. In response, some companies invest, at significant cost, in driver education programmes for their employees. Driver education programmes have also been offered to drivers who have committed traffic offences. In some cases, drivers attending such programmes are offered lower insurance premiums, or can have citations removed from their driving records, on the assumption that they would be 'safer' drivers after the programme.</P>
<P>In the past few years, however, a different perspective on road safety has emerged that emphasises a systems approach to improving road safety and that questions an over-reliance on driver education. It is well established in industrial safety that the operator is only part of a dynamic system with many components and the operator has inherent limitations and predictable error rates. The systems approach accepts driver limitations and aims to reduce traffic crashes by designing the traffic environment with these limitations in mind. From a systems perspective, it is those that build and operate the road system that have the greatest impact on road safety and attempting to eliminate driver error is considered unlikely to have any significant impact in reducing traffic crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-04-19 15:40:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The theoretical debate about the value of driver education programmes can best be resolved by a consideration of the empirical evidence for their effectiveness. Indeed, the preparation of systematic reviews of the evidence for the effectiveness of road safety interventions has been given a high priority by the World Health Organization in its strategy to reduce traffic injuries. This systematic review was commissioned by the Head of Occupational Safety of AstraZeneca, a large pharmaceutical company, in response to a BMJ editorial (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002</LINK>) calling for road safety policy to be based on evidence. In 2002, the 26,000 AstraZeneca sales representatives drove approximately 514 million km in total and there were 111 traffic crashes, of which 11 were serious. Road traffic injuries account for 59 per cent of all lost time injuries and are the most common cause of injury within the company. The company had responded by providing driver education programmes and was keen to establish whether this approach was effective.</P>

</P>
<UL>
<LI>C = trials in which concealment was inadequate (such as alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth)</LI>

<P>The relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial and were pooled using a random effects model.</P>
<P>A number of studies included in the meta-analysis reported either the risk of drivers having one or more crashes/offences or the rate of crashes/offences in the follow-up period. In order to pool the results across all studies it was necessary to translate the rate statistic into a risk of having one or more failures. Assuming that the number of crashes/offences follow a negative binomial (over-dispersed Poisson) distribution, explicit formulae (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>) link the expected rate with the expected risk, provided that the degree of over-dispersion is known. For crashes, analysis suggested that there was little or no over-dispersion, whilst for offences, analysis suggested an over-dispersion parameter of 0.37. These estimates of over-dispersion were used to estimate expected risks where only rates were given. The variance of the log risk ratio was calculated via the standard formula.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Trials of programmes were eligible if they incorporated an education component aimed at the motor vehicle driver. Two distinct forms of education were identified. The first of these was <I>remedial</I> driver education, aimed at drivers who had poor previous driving records in terms of the number of prior crashes and/or offences. This type of education would tend to emphasise developing skills and knowledge to improve the drivers' behaviour to prevent recidivism and promote safety. The second form, was <I>advanced</I> driver education, aimed at the 'general' driver, that would build upon the initial education given to drivers before obtaining a licence. Emphasis would be placed on the further development of driving skills for the maintenance and improvement of good driving.<BR/>
<BR/>Of the included trials, four investigated the effectiveness of advanced driver education (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nolen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nolen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Schuman 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoke-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Stoke 1980</LINK>).

<P>One trial targeted 'older' drivers between the ages of 65 and 88 (<LINK REF="STD-McCoy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McCoy 1993</LINK>), and one recruited senior pupils of a High School (<LINK REF="STD-Schuman-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Schuman 1971</LINK>).

Participants were all full driving licence holders, hence individuals were at least 16 years of age.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The types of education interventions ranged from an advisory letter or driving manual sent out to participants, to a formal education course, sometimes involving multiple sessions with instructors at designated centres, delivered in an individual or a group setting. All interventions involved the transfer of information aimed at improving driving performance and safety.</P>
<P>Three distinct varieties of driver education were identified for inclusion into the analysis.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Correspondence education</U>. Programmes were considered to be 'correspondence education' if they did not involve direct contact with an instructor. Educational information was usually contained within a manual or letter sent to drivers.</LI>
<LI>
<U>Group education</U>. Programmes were classed as 'group education' if information was delivered to a group of drivers, hence the content was not designed around the requirement of an individual participant. These generally took the form of one or more pre-organised sessions led by an instructor.</LI>
<LI>
<U>Individual education</U>. Programmes were classed as 'individual education' if they consisted of a session in which the participating driver received education delivered on a one-on-one basis with an instructor. The content of the information given could often be geared to suit the specific requirements of the driver attending.</LI>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review of randomised controlled trials provides no evidence that post-licence driver education programmes are effective in preventing road traffic injuries or crashes. Although the results are compatible with a small reduction in the occurrence of traffic offences, this may be due to publication or other selection biases, or else to bias in the included trials. Because of the large number of randomised participants included in the meta-analysis (close to 300,000 for some outcomes), we can exclude, with reasonable precision, the possibility of even modest benefits. </P>
<P>Publication and other selection biases are a potential threat to validity in all systematic reviews, and in this review there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry using both graphical and statistical methods. From the graphical presentations it would appear that any such bias would lead to an overestimation of the beneficial effect of driver education. Inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of outcome assessment, and large losses to follow-up in many of the include trials also call into question the validity of the observed reduction in traffic offences following driver education. Although we pooled the data in a random effects meta-analysis, there was significant heterogeneity in several of the meta-analyses, and these should be interpreted with particular caution. The observed heterogeneity may be due to differences in the study populations, in the types of education programmes, or in the way that the outcome data were defined and collected. </P>
<P>The included trials ranged over a 40-year publication time span, all but four were of remedial driver education and only one was conducted outside the USA. As a result, it may not be appropriate to generalise from this systematic review and make inferences about the effectiveness of present-day driver education programmes. On the other hand, we can reasonably conclude that the effectiveness of current driver education programmes is as yet unproven, an observation that casts doubt on the wisdom of placing undue emphasis on this approach in current road safety policy. </P>
<P>Our review was commissioned by AstraZeneca &#8722; a company that provides driver education programmes for most of its driving employees in an effort to reduce the occurrence of occupational road traffic injuries &#8722;and it is important to consider the implications of our results for this policy. Whilst we cannot claim that our results show that this policy is ineffective, we would argue that, in the light of the evidence from previous trials, unrealistic expectations about the effectiveness of driver education must be avoided. We would recommend that the company pursue other approaches to reducing road traffic injuries amongst its employees. For example, reducing risk exposure by eliminating all unnecessary car journeys, encouraging the use of technologies such as teleconferencing as alternatives to travel, and using safer modes such as train travel (<LINK REF="REF-HSE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSE 2002</LINK>), whenever possible.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence that current post-licence driver education is an effective measure for the reduction of road traffic crashes. Hence, it can be considered unwise to place undue emphasis on such an approach in road safety policy. Emphasis, instead, might be more appropriately placed on other strategies such as reducing drivers' crash risk exposure by eliminating unnecessary car journeys.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In our search for studies of post-licence driver education we found just three randomised controlled trials conducted within the last 15 years suitable for inclusion in this systematic review, and just one trial conducted outside the USA. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials with injury outcomes are required in a variety of countries, to determine the effectiveness of current post-licence driver education. </P>

<CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST>
<P>The Head of Occupational Safety of the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca commissioned this systematic review and provided extramural support. This contribution was in response to a BMJ editorial calling for an evidence-based approach to road safety policy. Also, road traffic crashes are currently the company's leading cause of occupational injury and strategies to reduce the traffic crash involvement of its employees are considered of high priority. This systematic review has not involved any of AstraZeneca's products.</P>
