<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the review 'Calcium channel blockers for inhibiting preterm labour ' which was first published in <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2002.<BR/>
<BR/>This update includes published and unpublished data from one additional trial (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=10154047637224919273100201110620&amp;format=revman#std-weerakul-2002">Weerakul 2002</A>) and unpublished information from the author of one previously included trial (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=10154047637224919273100201110620&amp;format=revman#std-larmon-1999">Larmon 1999</A>). The review now contains twelve trials which enrolled 1029 women.<BR/>
<BR/>The extra data included in this review result in a marginal decrease in the previously demonstrated effect on the outcome of birth within 48 hours of commencement of treatment (no longer statistically significant) but show a reduction (which reached statistical significance) in the outcome of birth prior to 34 weeks associated with the use of calcium channel blockers. These additional data strengthen the beneficial effect of calcium channel blockers on several neonatal outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>The conclusions of the earlier version of the review remain basically unchanged. Calcium channel blockers are a safer and more effective tocolytic agent than betamimetics for mothers and babies</P>

<P>Preterm birth is when a baby is born between 20 and 36 completed weeks' gestation. These babies are generally more ill and are less likely to survive than babies born at term. Preterm babies are also more likely to have some disability, and the earlier the baby is born the more likely they are to have problems. Even short-term postponement of preterm birth can improve outcomes for babies, as this gives time for the mother to be given a steroid injection to help develop the baby's lungs develop prior to birth. Short-term postponement of preterm birth may also give the chance to transfer the mother, if required, to somewhere where there is more expert care for the baby available. Drugs used to try and stop labour are called tocolytics. The most common drugs used are betamimetics, but calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are another option. CCBs are commonly used for reducing high blood pressure, but they can also relax uterine contractions. We looked to see if CCBs were effective in postponing labour and improving outcomes for babies, and also whether CCBs were better than betamimetics and other types of tocolytics used to postpone preterm labour and birth.</P>
<P>We found 38 trials involving 3550 women, some comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with no tocolytics and others comparing CCBs with tocolytics. The trials included in this review were considered to be of fair quality. We found that CCBs, specifically nifedipine, is better than no tocolytics for postponing preterm birth for 48 hours, which may help improve outcomes for babies. Compared with betamimetics, CCBs were more effective at postponing birth, had fewer side effects for women, and appeared to improve some important short-term outcomes for the baby (breathing difficulties, gut infections, and admission to special care units). Calcium channel blockers were better than other types of tocolytics for some outcomes only. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) appear to have fewer side effects for women than CCBs, but ORAs are not as good at reducing preterm birth. Another type of CCB, nicardipine, was only used in three trials, but was not more effective than other tocolytics. Longer-term infant and childhood outcomes were not able to be assessed due to lack of available information. In general, CCBs are more effective than betamimetics, but only sometimes more effective than other types of tocolytics.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-30 14:26:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity, affecting around 9% of births in high-income countries and an estimated 13% of births in low- and middle-income countries. Tocolytics are drugs used to suppress uterine contractions for women in preterm labour. The most widely used tocolytic are the betamimetics, however, these are associated with a high frequency of unpleasant and sometimes severe maternal side effects. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (such as nifedipine) may have similar tocolytic efficacy with less side effects than betamimetics. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) (e.g. atosiban) also have a low side-effect profile.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, undertook quality assessment and data extraction. Results are presented using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) were calculated for categorical outcomes that were statistically significantly different.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-30 14:28:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>This update includes 26 additional trials involving 2511 women, giving a total of 38 included trials (3550 women). Thirty-five trials used nifedipine as the CCB and three trials used nicardipine. Blinding of intervention and outcome assessment was undertaken in only one of the trials (a placebo controlled trial). However, objective outcomes defined according to timing of birth and perinatal mortality were considered to have low risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>Two small trials comparing CCBs with placebo or no treatment showed a significant reduction in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43) and an increase in maternal adverse effects (RR 49.89, 95% CI 3.13 to 795.02, one trial of 89 women). Due to substantial heterogeneity, outcome data for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) were not combined; one placebo controlled trial showed no difference (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) while the other (non-placebo controlled trial) reported a reduction (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62). No other outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>Comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with other tocolytics by type (including betamimetics, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch, non-steriodal anti inflammatories (NSAID), magnesium sulphate and ORAs), no significant reductions were shown in primary outcome measures of birth within 48 hours of treatment or perinatal mortality.</P>
<P>Comparing CCBs with betamimetics, there were fewer maternal adverse effects (average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.53) and fewer maternal adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy (average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.48). Calcium channel blockers resulted in an increase in the interval between trial entry and birth (average MD 4.38 days, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.52) and gestational age (MD 0.71 weeks, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.09), while decreasing preterm and very preterm birth (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98 and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93); respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86); necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96); intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84); neonatal jaundice (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92); and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87). No difference was shown in one trial of outcomes at nine to twelve years of age.</P>
<P>Comparing CCBs with ORA, data from one study (which did blind the intervention) showed an increase in gestational age at birth (MD 1.20 completed weeks, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.15) and reductions in preterm birth (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.89); admissions to the NICU (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85); and duration of stay in the NICU (MD -5.40 days,95% CI -10.84 to 0.04). Maternal adverse effects were increased in the CCB group (average RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.74).</P>
<P>Comparing CCBs with magnesium sulphate, maternal adverse effects were reduced (average RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.68), as was duration of stay in the NICU (days) (MD -4.55, 95% CI -8.17 to -0.92). No differences were shown in the comparisons with GTN patch or NSAID, although numbers were small.</P>
<P>No differences in outcomes were shown in trials comparing nicardipine with other tocolytics, although with limited data no strong conclusions can be drawn. No differences were evident in a small trial that compared higher- versus lower-dose nifedipine, though findings tended to favour a high dose on some measures of neonatal morbidity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-28 00:26:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Calcium channel blockers (mainly nifedipine) for women in preterm labour have benefits over placebo or no treatment in terms of postponement of birth thus, theoretically, allowing time for administration of antenatal corticosteroids and transfer to higher level care. Calcium channel blockers were shown to have benefits over betamimetics with respect to prolongation of pregnancy, serious neonatal morbidity, and maternal adverse effects. Calcium channel blockers may also have some benefits over ORAs and magnesium sulphate, although ORAs results in fewer maternal adverse effects. However, it must be noted that no difference was shown in perinatal mortality, and data on longer-term outcomes were limited. Further, the lack of blinding of the intervention diminishes the strength of this body of evidence. Further well-designed tocolytic trials are required to determine short- and longer-term infant benefit of CCBs over placebo or no treatment and other tocolytics, particularly ORAs. Another important focus for future trials is identifying optimal dosage regimens of different types of CCBs (high versus low, particularly addressing speed of onset of uterine quiescence) and formulation (capsules versus tablets). All future trials on tocolytics for women in preterm labour should employ blinding of the intervention and outcome assessment, include measurement of longer-term effects into early childhood, and also costs.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:10:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Preterm birth, defined as birth occurring between 20 and 36 completed weeks of gestation is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity. The rate of preterm birth is increasing across low- and middle-income countries, affecting 8.6% of births in high-income countries and between 7.4% to 13.3% in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, cerebral palsy and other forms of neuro-developmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2011</LINK>), blindness and deafness. The birth of a preterm infant who requires intensive care for survival is a crisis, not only for the infant, but also for the parents (<LINK REF="REF-McCain-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCain 1993</LINK>). The costs to the parents, community and society as a whole, both economic and emotional, are substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2011</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Approximately 65% to 70% are spontaneous preterm births either following spontaneous preterm labour (40% to 45%) or those following preterm rupture of membranes (25% to 30%) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>). While the cause of spontaneous preterm birth is often unclear, some risk factors have been identified including: maternal age (adolescence and advanced age); history of preterm birth; race; multiple pregnancy, short inter-pregnancy interval; infections; medical conditions; poor nutrition; psychological factors and genetic predisposition (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008)</LINK>.</P>
<P>Despite improvements in the standards in obstetric and neonatal care over recent years, no progress has been made over the last two decades in reducing the incidence of preterm birth in high-income countries. In fact, rates of preterm birth are rising, in part due to increasing obstetric intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2009</LINK>). Some benefits have been identified from prolongation of pregnancy, which theoretically allows time for corticosteroids to be administered to the mother to hasten fetal lung maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>), to effect transfer to a centre with neonatal intensive care facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1995</LINK>) and magnesium sulphate administration to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2009</LINK>). For these reasons, short-term tocolytic therapy is commonly used to inhibit preterm labour and postpone preterm birth.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:10:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Tocolytic drugs have been used to inhibit preterm labour, in order to allow time for co-intervention and potentially to defer preterm birth, thus improving neonatal outcomes with advancing gestation. A range of tocolytic agents that have been used to inhibit preterm labour are the topics of Cochrane systematic reviews including: nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) (<LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>), oxytocin receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>), betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>), cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>) and progesterone (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>), and their relative effects have been explored in a recent network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>). The betamimetics, arguably the most commonly used tocolytics, (ritodrine, salbutamol and terbutaline) have been shown to be effective in delaying delivery by seven days and longer, although no impact has yet been shown on perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>). Furthermore, betamimetics have a high frequency of unpleasant, sometimes severe maternal side effects including tachycardia, hypotension, tremor and a range of biochemical disturbances, and they have been associated with life-threatening cardiovascular and respiratory events and deaths. COX inhibitors show promise in earlier gestations but in later gestations there remains a concern regarding premature constriction or closure of the ductus arteriosus (<LINK REF="REF-Koren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 2006</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or calcium antagonists are non-specific smooth muscle relaxants, predominantly used for the treatment of hypertension in adults and are increasingly used as a tocolytic agent for women in preterm labour.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:10:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Calcium channel blockers exert their tocolytic effect by preventing the influx of extracellular calcium ions into the myometrial cell. They are entirely non-specific for uterine as distinct from other smooth muscle cells, but have been demonstrated in vitro to have a potent relaxant effect on human myometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Saade-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saade 1994</LINK>). The most widely used and studied CCB is nifedipine, which along with nicardipine, belongs to the dihydropiridine group. Nifedipine was first reported in an observational study in 1980 to be an effective tocolytic agent with minimal side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ulmsten-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulmsten 1980</LINK>). Nicardipine can be given orally or by intravenous route, whereas nifedipine can only be administered orally.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:10:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Calcium channel blockers have been proposed as effective agents for inhibiting preterm labour and they have less side effects than betamimetics. Betamimetics have a high frequency of unpleasant, sometimes severe maternal side effects including tachycardia, hypotension, tremor and a range of biochemical disturbances. Furthermore, betamimetic treatment is reported to have been associated with at least 25 maternal deaths, mainly from pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2001</LINK>).There is a need therefore for an effective tocolytic agent with fewer side effects than betamimetics.</P>
<P>However, concerns arose from animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Harake-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harake 1987</LINK>) that the CCB nifedipine may have adverse effects on fetal and placental circulation. Although there have been subsequent studies that failed to confirm this (<LINK REF="REF-Guclu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guclu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1990</LINK>), it is necessary to review the evidence for the safety and efficacy of this treatment. There have been some incidental case reports that the use of nifedipine in the treatment of preterm labour was associated with more cardiovascular side effects, such as hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-van-Veen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Veen 2005</LINK>), dyspnoea (<LINK REF="REF-van-Geijn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Geijn 2005</LINK>), pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Abbas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaast-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaast 2004</LINK>), maternal hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Hodges-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodges 2004</LINK>) and myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Oei-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhaert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhaert 2004</LINK>). These reported incidents were in women with multiple gestations, premature prolonged rupture of membranes (PPROM), vaginal blood loss, diabetes mellitus, or with a cardiovascular history, or who were treated simultaneously with, or immediately following, betamimetics.</P>
<P>Another tocolytic, oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORA) have been developed specifically as a tocolytic agent, with atosiban being the most researched and used ORA. ORA relax the myometrium by preventing a rise in intracellular calcium. Preliminary studies in pregnant and non-pregnant women have suggested a very low incidence of maternal side effects with ORA (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1998</LINK>), most of which are relatively minor: adverse injection site reaction, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain and hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Moutquin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moutquin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsatsaris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsatsaris 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent network meta-analysis of tocolytic agents concluded that prostaglandin inhibitors and CCBs had the highest probability of delaying delivery and improving neonatal and maternal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>). There are however, concerns regarding the potentially deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to COX inhibition on the fetal cardiovasculature, gut and kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Perron-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perron 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2011</LINK>). In addition, there are concerns regarding the increase in infant mortality with the use of magnesium sulphate for the treatment of preterm birth rightly limit its utility as a first-line tocolytic (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is therefore important to undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials of CCBs used in the management of women in preterm labour to determine the relative risks and benefits of this intervention. A series of Cochrane reviews have assessed the effects of different classes of tocolytics compared with placebo, and with each other (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>). A review on combinations of different tocolytics for women in preterm labour is the subject of a review currently in development (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004352.pub3/full#CD004352-bbs2-0112">Nardin 2006</A>).</P>

If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation units.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The analysis in this review involves multiple pregnancies, therefore, wherever possible, analyses should be adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>). Treating babies from multiple pregnancies as if they are independent, when they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies, will overestimate the sample size and give confidence intervals that are too narrow. Each woman can be considered a cluster in multiple pregnancy, with the number of individuals in the cluster being equal to the number of fetuses in her pregnancy. Analysis using cluster trial methods allows calculation of risk ratio and adjustment of confidence intervals. Usually this will mean that the confidence intervals get wider. Although this may make little difference to the conclusion of a trial, it avoids misleading results in those trials where the difference may be substantial.</P>
<P>We planned to adjust for clustering in the analyses, wherever possible, and to use the inverse variance method for adjusted analyses, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="REF-Yelland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelland 2011</LINK>.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I² was greater than 30% and either Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.</P>

<P>If 10 or more studies had contributed data to meta-analysis for any particular outcome, we investigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We assessed possible asymmetry visually. If asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we planned to perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect had not been clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials.</P>
<P>Where random-effects analyses were used, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<P>There was some inconsistency across the trials with respect to the way in which outcomes were reported. The clinically important outcome of delay in delivery for greater than or equal to 48 hours was reported in 31 of the 38 included trials, discontinuation of treatment because of adverse effects was reported in 21 trials, and perinatal mortality in 24 trials. Extremely preterm birth (before completion of 28 weeks of gestation) was reported in two trials, very preterm birth (before completion of 34 weeks of gestation) in 12 trials, and preterm birth (before completion of 37 weeks of gestation) in 21 trials. With the exception of neonatal mortality, neonatal outcomes were less consistently reported, and definitions were often lacking (e.g. criteria for diagnosing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), sepsis or for admission to intensive care nursery.<BR/>
<BR/>The neonatal outcomes of the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Papatsonis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Papatsonis 1997</LINK> were reported more comprehensively in a subsequent publication, with precise definitions. This second report used a more stringent definition for admission to the NICU than the one used in the initial report. Because the other trials used a more general definition (usually not defined, but presumably any admission to intensive care nursery) in order to maintain consistency, we have chosen to use the data from the primary publication for <LINK REF="STD-Papatsonis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Papatsonis 1997</LINK>. Some degree of assessment bias is possible for the neonatal morbidity indices in the trials because neonatal assessment was undertaken by clinicians not blinded<B> </B>to maternal treatment allocation.</P>

The total Movement ABC score was used, with a high score referring to less favourable motor functioning. Behavioural&#8211;emotional functioning was assessed using the Dutch version of the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-TM" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach TM</LINK>) to be completed by the parent. The child&#8217;s teacher completed the Teacher Report Form (TRF) (<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 1997</LINK>). The child's quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the Dutch TNO AZL Children's Quality of Life Questionnare (TACQOL) (<LINK REF="REF-Vogels-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vogels-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogels 2000</LINK>). Further, women completed the Dutch Nijmegen Parental Distress Index - Short version (NOSI-K) (<LINK REF="REF-Abidin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abidin 1992</LINK>) via a survey to assess parenting distress. Additional information about the child&#8217;s school level, family demographics and psychosocial care was obtained from the survey of women. In this review, we have included the outcomes of motor quality, behavioural&#8211;emotional functioning, parent stress by parent report and the child's quality of life reported by the child. <LINK REF="STD-Van-De-Water-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Van De Water 2008</LINK> reported two-year outcomes for children.

<P>Blinding of the intervention (performance bias) was attempted in only one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ara 2008</LINK>) - the only placebo controlled trial. For the remaining trials, the lack of blinding of the intervention may be, in part, as a result of the difficulties with adequately blinding such interventions (i.e. presentation of the intervention as either oral versus intravenous and the well-known side effects of certain interventions). For blinding of outcome measures (detection bias), all trials were deemed as having low risk of bias for objective outcomes (interval between trial entry and birth, gestation at birth (preterm birth and mean gestational age), perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal death). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klauser--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klauser 2012</LINK>) used blinded assessment of all outcome measures and was considered to have low risk of detection bias for both objective and subjective outcome measures.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-12 09:54:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review update includes 38 included trials involving 3550 women. Of these 38 trials, all but three used nifedipine as the CCB. The remaining three trials (261 women) used nicardipine as the CCB, and no differences in outcomes were shown in trials comparing nicardipine to other tocolytics, although with limited data no strong conclusions can be drawn. It must be noted that the majority of trials did not use blinding of the intervention or outcome assessment.</P>
<P>Two small studies with 173 women, (one used a placebo control and the other did not) (<LINK REF="STD-Ara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ara 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) comparing CCB with placebo or no treatment were included showing a reduction in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). The <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK> trial of CCB versus no treatment showed a significant reduction in preterm birth, while the placebo controlled <LINK REF="STD-Ara-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ara 2008</LINK> trial showed no difference. Maternal side effects from nifedipine were reported (percentage of women receiving nifedipine versus percentage receiving placebo); however, none were severe (flushing, headache and vertigo). Unfortunately, small numbers do not allow firm conclusions to be made.</P>
<P>Comparing CCB (mainly nifedipine) with other tocolytics by type (including betamimetics, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), non-steriodal anti inflammatories (NSAID), magnesium sulphate and oxytocin receptor antagonist (ORA)), no significant reductions were shown in the primary outcome measures of birth within 48 hours of treatment or perinatal mortality.</P>
<P>In 23 studies of 1793 women, CCB was shown to prolong pregnancy by an average of four days and reduce preterm birth, very preterm birth, and important neonatal morbidity. Long-term data were limited, although in one study no difference in the child's behavioural/emotional outcome, motor quality, need for special education, quality of life or parent stress (for the woman). Comparing CCB with ORA one study (145 women) showed a significant increase in gestational age at birth (average of one week) and a significant reduction in preterm birth with NNTB on average 5 (95% CI 3 to 15). Comparing CCB with magnesium sulphate (five studies; 651 women) neonatal duration of stay in the NICU was reduced by an average of around five days. No differences were shown in the comparisons with GTN, NSAID although numbers were small.</P>
<P>CCB resulted in fewer maternal adverse drug side reactions when compared to betamimetics, but more maternal adverse drug side reactions when compared to ORA and to placebo or no treatment. While cost-effectiveness data were not available, reductions in NICU admission provides further support for the use of CCB over betamimetics or ORA, and reduced NICU stay (on average four days less) for CCB over magnesium sulphate and ORA.</P>
<P>No differences were evident in one small study (102 women), which compared higher- versus lower-dose nifedipine, though findings tended to favour a high dose on some measures of neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Nassar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nassar 2009</LINK>). One of the largest trials in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Papatsonis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Papatsonis 1997</LINK>), which had the most favourable outcomes, compared betamimetics with a higher-dosage regimen for nifedipine than that used in most of the other trials (up to 40 mg in the first hour). However, based on the results of this review, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about optimal nifedipine dosage.</P>

<P>The benefit in terms of postponement of birth and less short-term neonatal morbidity supports the use of CCB over other tocolytics. However, it must be noted that with the lack of blinding of the intervention and outcome assessment in all trials included in this analysis, the possibility of important bias cannot be ruled out. This is of particularly importance for the less objective outcomes such as measures of neonatal morbidity. Further, these positive effects did not confer benefit in terms of reducing perinatal deaths and the effects on longer-term outcomes of death and neurosensory impairment are unclear. While robust measures of neurodevelopmental outcome were not available, data collected by survey of women enrolled in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Papatsonis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Papatsonis 1997</LINK>) and their children at nine to 12 years of age showed no difference between nifedipine and ritodrine in terms of quality of life and measures of behaviour/emotion, educational and motor quality reported by parents. No data were available on longer-term outcomes for children of women randomised to tocolytics versus placebo.</P>
<P>Of the 38 included trials, all but three used nifedipine as the CCB. The remaining three trials (261 women) used nicardipine as the CCB, and no differences in outcomes were shown in trials comparing nicardipine with other tocolytics, although with limited data no strong conclusions can be drawn. Most of the experience with clinical use of nicardipine is by the intravenous (IV) route. Several cases of pulmonary oedema have been reported in the last 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Akerman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akerman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perbet--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perbet 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philippe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philippe 2009</LINK>). Although risk factors were present in most of these reports (multiple pregnancy, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or of betamimetics, cardiovascular history), all of these cases occurred under IV treatment and one of the main factors associated with pulmonary oedema was the high volume of IV fluids perfused. Clinical use of IV nicardipine should cautiously take into account all possible risk factors for pulmonary oedema and the lack of evidence in favour of IV treatment.</P>
<P>Comparing CCB with magnesium sulphate, some benefit was shown in terms of reducing neonatal duration of stay in the NICU. No differences were shown in the comparisons with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), non-steriodal anti inflammatories (NSAID) although numbers were small.</P>
<P>Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORA) have recently been proposed as a safe and effective tocolytic agent. This review includes two small trials (total of 225 women) comparing CCB (nifedipine) with the ORA atosiban (<LINK REF="STD-Kashanian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kashanian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salim-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salim 2012</LINK>). Due to small numbers, no conclusions could be drawn on the superiority of one agent over the other. The results of two ongoing trials of atosiban and nifedipine (<LINK REF="STD-APOSTEL-III-2011" TYPE="STUDY">APOSTEL III 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 2011</LINK>) are awaited. The role of ORA for tocolysis is the focus of another Cochrane review (review update in progress: <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a substantial amount of evidence from potentially eligible controlled trials (nine studies) that we were unable to include in this review due to insufficient information. Six of these trials compared CCB with betamimetic agents (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubay-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dubay 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sofat-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sofat 1994</LINK>), two compared CCB with magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="STD-Haghighi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haghighi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lotfalizadeh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lotfalizadeh 2010</LINK>) and in one trial, CCB was compared with atosiban (<LINK REF="STD-de-Heus-2009" TYPE="STUDY">de Heus 2009</LINK>). The review authors regard this as an important deficiency. However, in reviewing the information currently available from these trials, it does not appear that as a group, their results differ substantially or systematically from the trials included in this review.</P>
<P>Research into treatments to prevent preterm birth are challenged by the underlying mechanisms that lead to preterm labour. Preterm birth is the common final outcome of a number of interrelated pathophysiological pathways. These include intrauterine infection and inflammation, uterine overdistension (in multiple pregnancy or polyhydramnios), fetal stress responses and utero-placental insufficiency. Tocolytic therapies largely act on the final common means which lead to labour and birth. To have a greater impact on clinical infant/child outcomes, treatments may need to address the higher order causes of preterm birth and act before the cascade of changes is set in motion. This remains a focus of ongoing scientific and clinical research.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:20:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>As blinding of intervention and outcome assessment was undertaken in only one of the included trials (a placebo controlled trial), the overall quality of the included trials is considered fair only. However, we defined objectively measured outcomes as those according to timing of birth and perinatal mortality and considered these measures to be at low risk of detection bias. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klauser--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Klauser 2012</LINK>) used blinded assessment of all outcome measures and was considered to have low risk of detection bias for both objective and subjective outcome measures. All other trials were considered to be at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcome measures (i.e. maternal and neonatal morbidity measures).</P>
<P>Sample attrition was not considered a serious source of bias as the majority had minimal or no attrition. To enable analysis by intention-to-treat, additional information was sought from the investigators of 13 included studies and data were provided and included for 11 of these studies.</P>
<P>Selective reporting was considered possible in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ganla-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ganla 1999</LINK>) where the outcomes of pregnancy prolongation for 48 hours and until 36 weeks were omitted from the results. In 23 trials, we found no obvious evidence of reporting bias and judged these trials to be at low risk of bias. In the remaining trials it was unclear whether selective reporting bias was present.</P>
<P>Sixteen studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias for other potential sources of bias based on baseline characteristics being similar between groups and no other bias apparent. In the remaining 22 studies, the risk of other sources of bias was unclear<B>. </B>One study <LINK REF="STD-Ganla-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ganla 1999</LINK> also concluded that perinatal mortality was reduced by nifedipine, although this outcome was not reported in the results. This research article is housed on a website sponsored by a global pharmaceutical company.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:20:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A series of Cochrane reviews assessed the effects of different classes of tocolytics compared with placebo, and with each other (<LINK REF="REF-Bain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bain 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>). A review on combinations of different tocolytics for women in preterm labour is currently in development (<LINK REF="REF-Nadin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent review of tocolytic trials, which included both network and pair-wise meta-analysis, examined a range of tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, CCB, COX inhibitors, ORA, nitric oxide donors and other drugs) (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004352.pub3/full#CD004352-bbs2-0104">Haas 2012</A>). The results of this review suggest that all types of tocolytics were better than placebo in terms of prolonging pregnancy beyond 48 hours, but that betamimetics performed less well than other types of tocolytics. CCB and COX inhibitors were reported to have the highest probability of delaying delivery and improving neonatal and maternal outcomes.</P>
<P>The evidence regarding side effects from this review (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>) suggested that COX inhibitors and ORA were associated with fewer maternal side effects compared with other types of tocolytics. Our review showed a higher adverse effects profile for betamimetics and that tocolysis with CCB was associated with clinically important fewer events. A higher adverse event profile for betamimetics was shown in the Cochrane review of betamimetics compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another review, using indirect comparison of randomised trials, of the CCB (nifedipine) with ORA atosiban concluded that nifedipine was more effective than atosiban and lowered the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Coomarasamy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coomarasamy 2003</LINK>). While, we did not show clear evidence for benefit for CCB over ORA, one small trial (145) women (which did not employ blinding of the intervention) showed some benefit in terms of preterm birth and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Our findings are consistent with the Cochrane review on ORA for inhibiting preterm labour, which also found no clear benefit for ORA over CCB (review update in progress <LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>) although ORA has advantages over CCB and other tocolytics of less maternal adverse effects.</P>
<P>The CCB, nifedipine has the advantage of ease of oral administration and is very inexpensive compared with atosiban (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2004</LINK>). However, more robust evidence from well-designed, randomised trials with direct comparisons of nifedipine and ORA are required before strong recommendations for clinical practice can be made. Consistent with our conclusions, Hass et al (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>) also supported further well designed, randomised, placebo controlled trials to evaluate CCB versus ORA in prolonging pregnancy for women in preterm labour. Two such studies are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-APOSTEL-III-2011" TYPE="STUDY">APOSTEL III 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 2011</LINK>). Adequate comparison of CCBs with COX inhibitors (such as indomethacin) for preterm labour is also lacking.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:20:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>CCBs (mainly nifedipine) for women in preterm labour have benefits over placebo or no treatment in terms of postponement of birth thus, theoretically, allowing time for administration of antenatal corticosteroids and transfer to higher level care. CCBs were shown to have benefits over betamimetics with respect to prolongation of pregnancy, serious neonatal morbidity, and maternal adverse effects. CCBs may also have some benefits over ORA and magnesium sulphate, although ORA results in fewer maternal adverse effects. The quality of included studies limits the ability for firm conclusions to be drawn.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-09 20:20:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Further well-designed tocolytic trials are required to determine short- and longer-term infant benefit of CCB over placebo or no treatment and other tocolytics, particularly ORA. Another important focus for future trials is identifying optimal dosage regimens of nifedipine (high versus low, particularly addressing speed of onset of uterine quiescence) and formulation (capsules versus tablets). All future trials on tocolytics for women in preterm labour should employ blinding of the intervention and outcome assessment and include measurement of longer-term effects into early childhood, and also costs.</P>

<P>Pregnancy prolongation for 48 hrs/until 36 weeks, hyaline membrane disease not reported as expected. Treatment "success" and "failure" reported only. Failure to achieve uterine relaxation or development of significant side in mother or fetus was considered treatment "failure" and treatment "success" was only reported as the inverse of this. Paper concludes that perinatal mortality is reduced by nifedipine when this outcome is not reported in the results.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-11-08 12:25:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>I am concerned that there is unintentional bias in favour of the use of calcium channel blockers and against oxytocin antagonists in two recent Cochrane reviews, this one and the review of oxytocin antagonists (1).</P>
<P>Objective judgement of trial quality<BR/>Four studies of oxytocin antagonists (European 2001, French/Austr. 2001, <LINK REF="REF-Moutquin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moutquin 2000</LINK>, and Romero 2000) in the review of oxytocin antagonists (1) are recorded as 'Blinding outcome assessment: unknown' despite their using a double dummy technique with no mention that the blinding was broken. Another, Goodwin 1994, is classified as 'Blinding outcome assessment: no' despite the review authors correctly noting that a double dummy technique was used. The relevant section of the published paper reads as follows: "the pharmacist would open the envelope to reveal the patient's treatment assignment for the purpose of preparing the study drug infusion solution. The treatment assignment was not revealed to other persons, and the individual preparing the drug was not involved in patient care." Surely all five trials should be classified as 'Blinding outcome assessment: yes'.</P>
<P>Subjective judgement of trial quality<BR/>In the text of the calcium channel review, the trials are classified as of reasonable quality and no statement is made about quality in the abstract.</P>
<P>In fact none were blinded; they were all relatively small (mean group size 43) and only four had performed a sample size calculation. The lack of blinding is particularly important since all the reported outcomes favouring calcium channel blockers are susceptible to biased ascertainment, and the only hard outcome, perinatal death, showed a trend against calcium channel blockers (see below).</P>
<P>In contrast the oxytocin antagonist reviewers classify <LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1996</LINK>a as 'not high quality' because it was unblinded.</P>
<P>Choice of outcomes to report in the abstract<BR/>The calcium channel review abstract finds space to report seven beneficial effects of calcium channel blockers on surrogate outcomes, either prolongation of labour or surrogate fetal outcomes, but fails to mention perinatal deaths which had a relative risk 1.65 (95% CI 0.74-3.64) favouring other tocolytics. Nor are total pregnancy losses mentioned. These would include the four neonatal deaths reported by Koks 1993 in a ratio of 3:1 against calcium channel blockers.</P>
<P>In the oxytocin antagonist review (1) abstract, five unfavourable conclusions against placebo are reported. Although all of them might be explained by the gestational age imbalance at trial entry in the relevant trial (Romero 2000), this qualification is only mentioned in relation to one, infant death, and is removed from the synopsis where the association is repeated. In the comparison with beta-mimetics, the first outcome reported is birth weight under 1,500g, an outcome which was not pre-specified in the review methods and which is the only statistically significant outcome out of 21 reported for this comparison. Only later is the reduction in adverse drug reactions compared to beta-mimetics reported.</P>
<P>Choice of language<BR/>In the review of calcium channel blockers, all of the seven sentences in the abstract conclusions and the plain language summary contain a favourable opinion of calcium channel blockers. The single exception is a call for research into the effect of different dosing regimes, with the implication that the primary effectiveness question has been answered.</P>
<P>The authors' conclude: "it is considered unlikely that [placebo controlled trials of calcium channel blockers] will be conducted given the unequivocal impact that this method of tocolysis has on short term postponement of delivery". This statement is much too strong. It is based entirely on unblended trials against other tocolytics. Two of the five relevant outcomes (birth prior to 37 weeks, and birth within 48 hours) showed only a non-significant effect, two (birth prior to 34 weeks and within seven days) just reached the 0.05 level, and the final outcome (pregnancy prolongation in days), while statistically significant, shows significant heterogeneity between trials.</P>
<P>In neither the abstract nor the conclusion section of the calcium channel blocker review is it mentioned that there have been no placebo-controlled trials of calcium channel blockers in preterm labour.</P>
<P>In contrast, instead of saying that oxytocin antagonists had shown equivalent efficacy to other tocolytics in four high quality trials, the authors phrase their summaries as either 'has failed to demonstrate superiority' or 'is no better than other drugs'. This seems gratuitous negativity.</P>
<P>Choice of outcomes to report<BR/>The outcomes selected for the oxytocin review differ significantly from those chosen for the calcium channel blocker review. The reason is not clear.</P>
<P>Finally, the oxytocin antagonist review claims to be going to look at predefined outcomes measured related to the prolongation of pregnancy. However the predefined outcomes for the two placebo-controlled trials, namely 'time to delivery' or 'therapeutic failure' were not reported.</P>
<P>Authorship of the reviews<BR/>I note that both these reviews share an author, Dimitri Papatsonis, who is the first author of the largest trial of calcium channel blockers, upon which many of the favourable calcium channel blocker meta analyses depend.</P>
<P>I recognise that it is probably impossible to always avoid using trial authors to write systematic reviews, and that Dr Papatsonis acknowledges his possible conflict of interest. Nor do I accuse him, or any of the review authors, of any intentional bias. Nevertheless, I am concerned about possible unintentional bias against commercially developed pharmacological agents. This risks harming the future development of drugs for use in pregnancy, something which I am sure everyone would support.</P>

<P>On behalf of the review authors, we respond to Professor Thornton's comments about the review of calcium channel blockers (CCB) [1] and the review of oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORA) [2] for preventing preterm birth.</P>
<P>Judgement of trial quality<BR/>For the ORA review, blinding of the intervention is not synonymous with blinding of outcome assessment. Unless authors stated so in their original reports, or in response to further queries, we cannot presume that those assessing the outcome of interest were blinded to the allocated intervention. For example, in trials comparing betamimetics with atosiban, blinding of the intervention is difficult due to the maternal and fetal side effects of betamimetics, particularly tachycardia and maternal palpitations. Therefore, until further information is received from the trial authors, blinding of assessment of outcome is classified as "unknown" for these four trials (European 2001, French/Austr. 2001, <LINK REF="REF-Moutquin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moutquin 2000</LINK>, and Romero 2000). We agree Goodwin 1994 should also be classified as "unknown", and this is now corrected.</P>
<P>We disagree that assessment of trial quality was subjective. The statements "reasonable quality" used in the calcium channel blocker (CCB) review and "not high quality" in the ORA review are intended to imply that the trials were neither poor quality nor high quality. Studies were judged to be of poor quality if no adequate method of allocation concealment was described, as this is one of the most important quality indicators regardless of whether the intervention was blinded. In accordance with Cochrane methodology, small numbers and lack of sample size calculations were not considered indicators of trial quality.</P>
<P>Choice of outcomes to report in the abstract<BR/>For the CCB review, we believe we have adequately acknowledged the potential for bias in the ascertainment of neonatal outcomes. We also note that the results were consistent across the included trials, but acknowledge that this does not rule out bias. A statement regarding trial quality will be included in the abstract for the next update of the CCB review</P>
<P>The outcome measures in the abstract of the CCB review were considered to be clinically important outcomes for this review. We will include the outcome of perinatal mortality in the abstract for the next update of the review.</P>
<P>In the ORA review abstract, the potential for bias due to the gestational age imbalance at trial entry in the Romero trial is acknowledged. We have made it clearer how this relates to the other data presented by stating at the start of this paragraph the number of trials and women in this comparison. We prespecified birthweight as a clinically important outcome measure for the review, and considered it reasonable to include the finding of birthweight &lt;1500gms in the abstract. In the abstract results, the ordering of text on maternal drug reaction for the comparison of ORA with betamimetics provides consistency with the reporting of the outcomes for the comparison of atosiban versus placebo.</P>
<P>Choice of language<BR/>We appreciate that the upper confidence interval for a number of the statistically significant outcomes reported approached 1, no difference. However, based on the point estimates of the effects and the consistency in the findings across these outcomes, we believe that the conclusions of the CCB review and wording of the abstract accurately reflects the findings. The statistical heterogeneity found for the outcome of pregnancy prolongation we believe was appropriately managed in this review with the use of a random-effects model for the meta-analysis of this outcome.</P>
<P>While we feel the language used in the ORA review abstract accurately reflects the results, we will rephrase to take account of the perception we may have been too negative about atosiban.</P>
<P>Choice of outcomes to report<BR/>We accept the outcomes for the ORA and CCB reviews differ, as they do in other tocolysis reviews, and that this is not helpful for readers of the review. As there is overlap between the review teams for these two reviews, we will rectify this during the next update of these reviews.</P>
<P>Regarding the use of 'predefined' outcomes, this term relates to outcomes chosen by the reviewers as clinically meaningful and defined in the review protocol before the review begins. These outcomes may or may not match those reported for individual trials. If reported outcomes did not match those pre-specified for the review, wherever possible, additional information was sought from authors. For the placebo controlled trials in the ORA review, data on pregnancy prolongation was not provided in a format to enable inclusion in the review; while additional data were sought from the authors, these were not forthcoming. The outcome of "therapeutic failure" was reported in the individual trials, but was not chosen as an outcome for either the ORA or CCB reviews as it was considered susceptible to bias.</P>
<P>Authorship of the reviews<BR/>Whilst it is appropriate and common practice for experts to undertake systematic reviews within their area of expertise, we agree that this carries with it the potential for bias. For Cochrane reviews, however (including the ORA and CCB reviews), a number of steps are in place to ensure that this risk is minimised. These steps include: transparency of the review process through publication of the protocol for the review prior to commencement, rigorous peer review (including an external referee) of the protocol and the review, multiple review authors aiming for a mix of expertise and experience, and a feedback system which allows anyone to comment on reviews and protocols. In addition, the regular updating of reviews means that any errors or misperceptions can be corrected. We think it unlikely therefore that any harm will come to future development of drugs for use in pregnancy due to bias, whether intentional or not, in our review.</P>
