Need to check that this is what the authors mean. 20th March 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris C Data check on 17 December. Data from the new trial looks fine. I have added some of the control arm data to the SoF tables, but please could you complete the other control arms. Also could you choose between mls and Litres for change in FEV1. Previous trials reported as mls and new study is in Litres. Hi Chris - I have changed it to ML now (on FVC too). Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also the comments in the SoF tables do not have anything in the comment box at the end of the line! Please add. Also see comments on SoF below....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W notes 18/11/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract- something in the way the abstract background is written doesn't quite make sense - starts talking about 'the infected sputum' but sputum was not previously mentioned, so the abstract doesn't seem to stand alone. Please revise. Thanks. I've added a further sentence to clarify. Iain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of outcome measures: I think this sentence belongs in the &amp;quot;types of interventions&amp;quot; section? &amp;quot;Important co-interventions were physical interventions (physiotherapy) and drugs that increase mucociliary clearance (beta2- agonists) or change visco-elastic characteristics of sputum (corticosteroids).&amp;quot; Thank you - would have moved it to where it should be. Sorry about that. Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add the units (e.g. FEV1 (mL)) to the headings for the forest plots I think this should now be OK - please see 1.2, 4.4 and 4.6. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove the totals from the forest plots here there is only 1 study Thanks I have been through them all and they should all be OK now. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - granted there is not much data, but I'm not sure that it is helpful to have split them out into different doses on RhDNase? Perhaps there is big difference in how the different amounts work, but it is not specified in the review. I guess the drug is nebulised? The characteristics of included studies says aerosolised, can you summarise the route of administration under 'included studies' and make a comment there on the baseline characteristics of the participants in the included studies? A nebuliser is a device that generates an aerosol from a solution or suspension [of drug]. The drug (rhDNase) is aerosolised. I've commented on the participant characteristics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Naughty - you didn't do the outcomes you said you'd do! Back to the drawing board....!! Please take a look at what we have done. Is it OK now? Fingers crossed. Steve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you should try and create one summary of findings table for RhDNase - three is stretching it Emma I have reduced it to 5mg v placebo as per our telephone chat on 18th Dec.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>: This review considered the question of whether mucolytics may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis who do not also have cystic fibrosis. Studies of participants with cystic fibrosis were not included in this review, and we are unable to draw any conclusions on this treatment's relevance to people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>: Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in lung structure, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties. Mucolytic drugs break down phlegm, which can make it easier to cough up.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>: Four studies (with a total of 528 participants) were identified that met the inclusion criterion of comparing mucolytic treatment versus no mucolytic treatment. All studies were conducted in adults. One study considered bromhexine versus placebo, two compared RhDNase versus placebo (one for a period of two weeks and the other over a period of 24 weeks) and the fourth compared erdosteine with physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone in elderly patients. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that only descriptions of the individual studies were possible with very limited opportunities for combining the studies in single analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>No strong evidence is available to support the use of these drugs in people with bronchiectasis (from causes other than cystic fibrosis); however it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions, as so few studies have been reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>: Details of the way patients were allocated to receive or not receive mucolytics were not clearly described in any of the four studies. This was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. When this is taken into account, together with the imprecision of the results, estimates of the usefulness of mucolytics as treatment were generally judged to be of low quality in relation to (non&#8211;cystic fibrosis) bronchiectasis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiectasis is predominantly an acquired disease process that represents the end stage of a variety of unrelated pulmonary insults. It is defined as persistent irreversible dilatation and distortion of medium-sized bronchi. It has been suggested that with widespread use of high-resolution computed tomography, more bronchiectasis diagnoses are being made. Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis frequently have difficulty expectorating sputum. Sputum therefore is retained in the lungs and may become infected, leading to further lung damage. Mucolytic agents target hypersecretion or changed physiochemical properties of sputum to make it easier to clear. One drug, recombinant human DNase, breaks down the DNA that is released at the site of infection by neutrophils.</P>
<P>Mucus clearance along with antimicrobial therapy remains an integral part of bronchiectasis management. Chest physiotherapy along with mucolytic agents is commonly used in practice without clear supportive evidence.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials (with a combined total of 528 adult participants) were included, but almost none of the data from these studies could be aggregated in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>One trial (with 88 participants) compared bromhexine versus placebo. Compared with placebo, high doses of bromhexine with antibiotics eased difficulty in expectoration (mean difference (MD) -0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.81 to -0.25 at 16 days); the quality of the evidence was rated as low. A reduction in sputum production was noted with bromhexine (MD -21.5%, 95% CI -38.9 to -4.1 at day 16); again the quality of the evidence was rated as low. No significant differences between bromhexine and placebo were observed with respect to reported adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 2.93; 95% CI 0.12 to 73.97), and again the quality of the evidence was rated as low.</P>
<P>In a single small, blinded but not placebo-controlled trial of older (&gt; 55 years) participants with stable bronchiectasis and mucus hypersecretion, erdosteine combined with physiotherapy over a 15-day period improved spirometry and sputum purulence more effectively compared with physiotherapy alone. The spirometric improvement was small (MD 200 mL in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) and 300 mL in forced vital capacity (FVC)) and was apparent only at day 15, not at earlier time points.</P>
<P>The remaining two studies (with a combined total of 410 participants) compared recombinant human DNase (RhDNase) versus placebo. These two studies were very different (one was a two-week study of 61 participants, and the other ran for 24 weeks and included 349 participants), and the opportunity for combining data from the two studies was very limited. Compared with placebo, recombinant human DNase showed no difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or FVC in the smaller study but showed a significant negative effect on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the larger and longer study. For reported adverse events, no significant differences between recombinant human DNase and placebo were noted. In all of the above comparisons of recombinant human DNase versus placebo, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the harmful effects of recombinant human DNase in one trial and no evidence of benefit, this drug should be avoided in non&#8211;cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, except in the context of clinical trials. Evidence is insufficient to permit evaluation of the routine use of other mucolytics for bronchiectasis. High doses of bromhexine coupled with antibiotics may help with sputum production and clearance, but long-term data and robust clinical outcomes are lacking. Similarly, erdosteine may be a useful adjunct to physiotherapy in stable patients with mucus hypersecretion, but robust longer-term trials are required.</P>
<P>Generally, clinical trials in children on the use of various mucolytic agents are lacking. As the number of agents available on the market, such as RhDNase, acetylcysteine and bromhexine, is increasing, improvement of the evidence base is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiectasis is predominantly an acquired disease process that represents the end stage of a variety of unrelated pulmonary insults and antecedent events. It is defined in anatomical terms as persistent and irreversible dilatation and distortion of medium-sized bronchi. Focal or diffuse forms of bronchial disease also predispose to the development of bronchiectasis. Bronchial obstruction due to varied and unrelated causes (e.g. aspiration of foreign bodies, carcinoma, extrinsic compression by surrounding enlarged lymph nodes, inspissated viscid secretions) can cause obstructive or localised forms of bronchiectasis. Diffuse bronchiectasis is usually associated with previous widespread pneumonic damage (e.g. pertussis and measles pneumonia, severe influenza and varicella pneumonia, necrotising bacterial pneumonias due to <I>Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas</I> and anaerobic infections), chronic granulomatous disease (e.g. tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), hypersensitivity and immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. congenital or acquired ahypogammaglobulinaemia) or genetic syndromes (e.g. cystic fibrosis, tracheobronchomegaly, bronchial cartilage deficiency, Kartagener's syndrome, Young's syndrome, immotile cilia disease). Many of these conditions predispose to recurrent lower respiratory infection as a result of poor tracheobronchial clearance. It has been suggested that with widespread use of high-resolution computed tomography, more bronchiectasis diagnoses are being made (<LINK REF="REF-Goeminne-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goeminne 2010</LINK>), and mucus clearance along with antimicrobial therapy remains an integral part of management of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Stafler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stafler 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several agents are known to alter the physical or chemical characteristics of sputum such that removal of sputum from the airway becomes easier. These drugs are collectively known as mucolytics. The precise mechanism of action of many of these drugs is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Cotgreave-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotgreave 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2007</LINK>) but may include breaking down large molecules within the mucus to reduce viscosity and reducing the biological activity of various proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Zafarullah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zafarullah 2003</LINK>). Attempts have been made to classify mucoactive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Balsamo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balsamo 2010</LINK>) as true mucolytics (thin mucus), expectorants (work by inducing cough) and mucokinetics (increase mucus transport within the lungs), but in practice these drugs probably work through several of these mechanisms simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Tomkiewicz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomkiewicz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of action of recombinant human DNase (RhDNase or dornase alfa) is known. This is a mucolytic that enzymatically degrades the long chains of DNA derived from neutrophils that are a constituent of the pus that can form a considerable part of the mucus in infected lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Henke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henke 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mucolytics may be given orally or parenterally. Alternatively, some, such as recombinant human DNase (RhDNase), are delivered directly to the lungs by nebulisation and inhalation.</P>
<P>National guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TSANZ-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSANZ 2010</LINK>) consider RhDNase to be contraindicated in non&#8211;cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis following a trial that reported deleterious effects on both lung function and exacerbation rate in adults (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>). By extrapolation from this study, the same recommendation has been given for children with non-CF bronchiectasis. Based primarily on an earlier version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>), guidelines in the Southern hemisphere (<LINK REF="REF-TSANZ-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSANZ 2010</LINK>) recommend against the use of mucoactive drugs including mucolytics in bronchiectasis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiectasis is a disease characterised by excessive mucus production and retention. By reducing the viscosity of mucus, mucolytics may aid clearance of sputum from the airways. Removal of mucus plugs from small and medium-sized airways allows recruitment of the associated lung and hence improvement in spirometric measures of lung function. Retained sputum could potentially act as a culture medium for bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Stockley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockley 1995</LINK>), leading to recurrent or persistent chest infection. By enhancing mucus removal, this risk is reduced.</P>

The international headquarters of Boehringer Ingelheim, the pharmaceutical company that produces bromhexine, was contacted. Enquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies known and/or supported by this company or its subsidiaries were made so that these results could be included in our review. Finally, personal contact was made with colleagues and trialists working in the field of bronchiectasis to ask them to identify potentially relevant trials.

<P>One study of 15 days' duration compared bromhexine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>). Primary outcomes, exacerbations and hospitalisations were not reported. No significant difference was noted between bromhexine and placebo in terms of adverse events (OR 2.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.97; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>As for secondary outcomes, no deaths were reported. Symptoms were reported in terms of "difficulty in expectoration," sputum production, cough score and sputum quality. Difficulty in expectoration was significantly improved in the bromhexine-treated participants at day 10 (MD -0.45, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.03) and day 16 (MD -0.53, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.25). Our GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence in this trial produced a rating of low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The percentage change in sputum production was greater in the bromhexine group at days seven, 10 and 16 (MD -21.5, 95% CI -38.9 to -4.1 at day 16). The cough score was significantly reduced at day 13 (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.06). The quality of sputum was improved at both day 13 and day 16 (MD -0.45, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.034 at day 13). The analyses reported above were conducted by the authors of the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>), and additional data were supplied by the trial author (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>No significant difference between bromhexine and placebo in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) was noted at seven days (MD 108.60 mL, 95% CI -242.38 to 459.58; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) or at 13 days (MD 184.00 mL, 95% CI -149.75 to 517.75; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

Our GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence in this trial produced a rating of low (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). No significant differences were reported between RhDNase (5 mg) and placebo with respect to the numbers of participants requiring hospitalisation for infective exacerbation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 123.08; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The table of adverse events in the trial report provides numbers of incidents of adverse events, rather than numbers of participants experiencing adverse events; for this reason we have not entered the data using RevMan software. The authors of the trial report described no significant differences between RhDNase (5 mg) and placebo in terms of most of the 19 reported adverse events, with the only exception being the incidence of influenza syndrome as diagnosed by participants, with more occurrences reported in the RhDNase arm.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, no deaths occurred and no symptoms were reported. No significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (MD 2.10 L, 95% CI -2.90 to 7.10; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) or percentage change in forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD -2.00, 95% CI -6.16 to 2.16; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) was observed at day 15 of this trial.

<P>One study of two weeks' duration compared 2.5 mg RhDNase versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>). Our GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence in this trial produced a rating of low. No participants in the RhDNase (2.5 mg) or placebo arms were hospitalised for infective exacerbation. Again, we did not perform an analysis of the adverse events, as they were reported as numbers of events rather than as numbers of people experiencing one or more events.</P>
<P>Neither percentage change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (MD 2.10 L, 95% CI -2.95 to 7.15; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) nor percentage change in FVC (MD -2.40, 95% CI -6.42 to 1.62; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) was significantly different between groups. Only one significant difference between RhDNase (2.5 mg) and placebo was reported in changes from baseline on components of the functional status questionnaire quality of life assessment (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>), and this involved the dyspnoea component, favouring RhDNase (2.5 mg) (MD 1.70, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.23; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). No significant difference in sputum colour was reported (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>An additional, considerably longer, study of 24 weeks' duration compared 2.5 mg RhDNase versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>). Results were generally reported in a format that could not be included in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The study authors reported that the RhDNase group had a higher but non-significant protocol-defined exacerbation rate of 0.66 exacerbations per participant per 168 days compared with 0.56 exacerbations per participant in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.65). The RhDNase group also had a higher non&#8211;protocol-defined exacerbation rate than the placebo group (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.50), and when both of these types of exacerbations were combined, a significant increase in occurrence was noted in the RhDNase group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.79). RhDNase had a statistically significant negative effect (P value &#8804; 0.05) on FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, (mean percentage decline -1.7% in the placebo group and -3.6% in the RhDNase group; confidence intervals were not included in the trial report). Hospitalisation rates were increased in the RhDNase group (0.21 in the placebo group vs 0.39 in the treated group; RR 1.85, confidence intervals were not included in the trial report). Placebo-treated participants used antibiotics less (44.1 vs 56.9 days; P value &#8804; 0.05; confidence intervals were not included in the trial report) and steroids less (23.4 vs 29.4 days; P value &#8804; 0.05; confidence intervals were not included in the trial report) when compared with participants given RhDNase.</P>
<P>No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was reported between control and study groups. However, the study authors report higher levels of antibodies to RhDNase in the treatment group (OR 28.19, 95% CI 3.77 to 210.85; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>

<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, no deaths were reported. The impact on mucus density was evaluated in <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>. No significant differences between erdosteine and control were seen at five days (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.27), 10 days (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.14) or 15 days (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.09). Similarly, for mucus purulence (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>), no significant differences between erdosteine and control were noted at five days (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.30) and 10 days (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18); however, the significant difference at 15 days indicated benefit for erdosteine versus control (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.15). No significant differences were described between erdosteine and control at five days (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.36), 10 days (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.68) or 15 days (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83) in terms of mucus volume production (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). By applying GRADE criteria, review authors evaluated the quality of evidence on these outcomes as low (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A significant difference was indicated between erdosteine and control in change from baseline to day 15 for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (mL) (MD 200.00, 95% CI 39.97 to 360.03; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>), but no significant difference was noted for FEV1 %predicted (MD 4.50, 95% CI -3.11 to 12.11; <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>).

Scant data were reported on the primary outcomes of interest to this review and on outcomes important to the patient, such as quality of life.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK> tested the efficacy of adding bromhexine hydrochloride to an antibiotic during an acute infective exacerbation. The test dose chosen, 30 mg orally three times per day, is higher than the dose currently used in conventional medical practice. The drug was effective in improving sputum expectoration after ten days' treatment in participants with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis. It further reduced sputum production at seven, 10 and 16 days. It reduced cough significantly at only one time point and improved quality of sputum on days 13 and 16. The FEV<SUB>1</SUB> remained unchanged throughout the trials.</P>
<P>The clinical conclusions derived from these data are that oral bromhexine at a dose above the usual recommended level can be effective in changing sputum production and clearance during an acute infective exacerbation. This effect was seen after only seven days of treatment. It is impossible to judge whether concurrent use of bromhexine with the antibiotic ceftazidine introduced a synergistic interaction.</P>
<P>A recommendation for widespread use of bromhexine in bronchiectasis cannot be made on the basis of one trial alone, and it is clear that further well-designed randomised controlled studies are required to evaluate the role of this agent.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>) compared nebulised RhDNase versus placebo in participants with chronic bronchiectasis. <LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK> was a two-week study, whereas <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK> ran for 24 weeks. Only one of the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>) considered RhDNase at 5 mg, and no important significant differences favouring RhDNase versus placebo were observed. Both trials evaluated nebulised RhDNase at a lower dose (2.5 mg), and the only significant difference between RhDNase (2.5 mg) and placebo reported in <LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK> was change from baseline in the dyspnoea component of the functional status questionnaire quality of life assessment, favouring the RhDNase (2.5 mg) arm. In the 24-week trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>), the study authors reported a higher incidence of exacerbations and hospital admissions in the RhDNase arm and higher levels of antibodies to RhDNase in the treatment group; stronger evidence would be required to justify its use outside of a clinical trial.</P>
<P>Erdosteine combined with physiotherapy slightly improved sputum purulence and small but clinically useful changes in spirometry over a 15-day period compared with physiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Crisafulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Crisafulli 2007</LINK>). No significant improvements were seen at earlier time points. This trial included 30 participants, all older than 55 years, with stable disease and at least moderate airflow limitation. This single, small trial provides insufficient evidence on its own to advocate the use of erdosteine, and further studies are required.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are needed to examine the role of the other available mucolytics in stable bronchiectasis and in the subset of patients experiencing exacerbations.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only three trials (with a total of 498 participants) provided data to this review, and opportunities for aggregation of the data were very limited. Several studies included a small number of participants with bronchiectasis in samples including participants with a range of respiratory conditions, and it was not possible to isolate the bronchiectasis data in those trials (details provided in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The overall completeness and applicability of data eligible for inclusion in this review are therefore limited to three very different studies, with only one considering the comparison of bromhexine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>; N = 88), one comparing RhDNase versus placebo over a period of two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>; N = 61) and another comparing RhDNase versus placebo over a period of 24 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>; N = 349),</P>

<P>In terms of random sequence generation, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>) were evaluated as unclear, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Crisafulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Crisafulli 2007</LINK>) was judged as low risk. All four were judged to have unclear risk with respect to allocation concealment. On performance bias, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wills-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wills 1996</LINK>) were assessed as low risk, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Crisafulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Crisafulli 2007</LINK>) was assessed as high risk.

<P>The support provided by the Cochrane Airways Review Group in identification of potentially relevant trials is of a very high order; nevertheless, uncertainties regarding study selection bias or publication bias are inevitably a concern in all reviews. Failure to identify unpublished trials may lead to an incomplete estimation of mucolytic agents. Whilst a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant clinical trials was conducted without language restrictions using a systematic search strategy to minimise the likelihood of bias, we recognise the possibility that additional unpublished trials may have been missed.</P>

<P>The availability of data in this update is similar to that in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>), and we have added only one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Crisafulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Crisafulli 2007</LINK>) (N = 30) comparing erdosteine and physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone; however it has been possible to include several additional analyses in the update.</P>

<P>Little evidence is available to recommend the routine use of mucolytics in bronchiectasis. However, bromhexine treatment for longer than seven days at a high dose has been reported to produce some beneficial changes in sputum production and clearance during an acute exacerbation. This finding is based on one rather old trial (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1991</LINK>) that included only 88 participants. Lung function was not altered with this drug, and quality of life and other outcome measures were not examined. No trial evidence exists at all for its use for longer than about two weeks.</P>
<P>Erdosteine in combination with physiotherapy showed a small benefit in spirometric parameters and sputum purulence after 15 days compared with physiotherapy alone. This finding comes from one small trial in stable older participants with mucus hypersecretion, which did not use a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Crisafulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Crisafulli 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient to allow a firm recommendation for either agent.</P>
<P>Evidence has suggested possible harm and no evidence of benefit from RhDNase in non-CF bronchiectasis. This drug should not be used routinely in this condition.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-29 14:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of mucolytics in adults and children with non-CF bronchiectasis are clearly needed. These should examine short-term use of mucolytics with or instead of antibiotics to reduce exacerbation duration and long-term effects of mucolytics on exacerbation frequency and lung function.</P>
