<P>This review examined whether providing iron supplementation is beneficial for preterm and low birth weight infants. The potential benefits included improvements in the level of red blood cells and stored iron in their blood. In the longer term, it was thought that iron supplementation might improve the babies' growth and development. We identified 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were relevant to this topic. We concluded that the long term benefits of iron supplementation for preterm and low birth weight babies remain uncertain. Regarding red blood cell and iron levels, it was found that in the first year of life, after two months of age, iron supplementation may result in slightly higher iron stores and red blood cell levels, and lower rates of iron deficiency anaemia. However, there was a lot of variability between different studies. More RCTs are needed, using well defined patient groups.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-09 22:52:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants are at risk of exhausting their body iron stores much earlier than healthy term newborns. It is widespread practice to give enteral iron supplementation to preterm and low birth weight infants to prevent iron deficiency anaemia. However, it is unclear whether supplementing preterm and low birth weight infants with iron improves growth and neurodevelopment. It is suspected that excess exogenous iron can contribute to oxidative injury in preterm babies, causing or exacerbating conditions such as necrotising enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity. Additionally, the optimal dose and timing of commencement and cessation of iron supplementation are uncertain.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-07-15 13:57:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effect of prophylactic enteral iron supplementation on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants. The secondary objectives were to determine whether iron supplementation results in improved haematological parameters and prevents other causes of morbidity and mortality.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-12 12:17:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1951 to August 2011), CINAHL (1982 to August 2011) and conference proceedings and previous reviews.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-12 12:17:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Both review authors separately evaluated trial quality and data extraction. We synthesised data using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs). Where data about the methodology and results or both were lacking, we made an attempt to contact the study authors for further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-23 15:23:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included twenty-six studies (2726 infants) in the analysis. The heterogeneity of participants, methods and results precluded an extensive quantitative synthesis. Of the 21 studies comparing iron supplementation with controls, none evaluated neurodevelopmental status as an outcome. Of thirteen studies reporting at least one growth parameter as an outcome, only one study of poor quality found a significant benefit of iron supplementation. Regarding haematological outcomes, no benefit for iron supplementation was demonstrated within the first 8.5 weeks of postnatal life (16 trials), except by two poor quality studies. After this age, most studies reported a higher mean haemoglobin in iron-supplemented infants. We were only able to include a limited number of studies in a quantitative meta-analysis, which suggested the haemoglobin concentration in iron-supplemented infants was higher by about 6 g/L at six to nine months. One study comparing high dose and low dose iron supplementation monitored neurodevelopmental outcome for one year, without finding any significant difference between the groups. One study comparing early versus late commencement of iron supplementation found no difference in cognitive outcome, but an increased rate of abnormal neurological examination in the late iron group at five years of age. The studies comparing high and low doses of iron indicated that there was no discernible haematological benefit in exceeding 'standard' doses of iron (i.e. 2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-22 15:37:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data suggest that infants who receive iron supplementation have a slightly higher haemoglobin level, improved iron stores and a lower risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia when compared with those who are unsupplemented. However, it is unclear whether iron supplementation in preterm and low birth weight infants has long term benefits in terms of neurodevelopmental outcome and growth. The optimum timing and duration of iron supplementation remains unclear.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-22 15:37:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-12 12:18:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the healthy term newborn's iron stores have been laid down during the third trimester. Therefore, this important acquisition of iron stores is reduced in preterm infants. The preterm infant has a higher requirement for iron due to proportionally more rapid postnatal growth than that of the term infant. This exacerbates the total body iron deficit of the preterm infant, as iron stores decrease over the first three months of postnatal life. While non-iron supplemented term infants have not been shown to develop biochemical or haematological iron deficiency before six months of age, there is a high rate of iron deficiency anaemia before this age in preterm infants fed only breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Human milk contains about 0.5 mg/L of elemental iron, while iron fortified formulas contain at least ten times that amount of iron. Despite their limited erythropoiesis, breast fed preterm infants are in negative iron balance for at least the first 30 days after birth, due to obligatory intestinal and insensible skin loss of iron (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supplementation of preterm neonates with 2 mg/kg/day of enteral iron, either as an iron mixture, or in the form of iron-fortified formula. It is recommended that this supplementation commence within two months of birth, and be continued until 12 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-22 15:37:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have demonstrated higher haemoglobin or ferritin levels in low or very low birth weight infants who were supplemented with enteral iron compared with breast milk or unfortified cow milk formula (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 1977</LINK>). However, the evidence is unclear as to whether this improvement in biochemical and haematological parameters is associated with a difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes or growth parameters in preterm and low birth weight infants.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-12 12:20:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies in term infants have demonstrated a correlation between iron deficiency anaemia and reduced performance in developmental testing (<LINK REF="REF-Lozoff-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozoff 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 1989</LINK>). It is hypothesised that the provision of enteral iron supplementation to preterm and low birth weight infants, who are at particular risk of iron deficiency, will result in improved neurodevelopmental outcomes by avoiding iron deficiency.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-13 13:52:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential risks of iron supplementation need to be considered. Iron overload can occur in the setting of multiple blood transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2001</LINK>). High transfusion requirements early in life have been shown to be associated with a greater risk of retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Dani-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dani 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inder 1997</LINK>). Increased body iron load has also been hypothesised to increase the risk of chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 1997</LINK>). Putative risks have been suggested related to iron's ability to cause oxidative injury. In addition to the direct oxidative property of iron, large iron doses decrease the absorption of the anti-oxidant vitamin E, thus exacerbating anaemia in vitamin E deficient neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Iron fortification of formulas has been suspected, but not proven, to cause a range of gastrointestinal symptoms in infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 1995</LINK>). While necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) has not been explicitly linked to enteral iron supplementation, it is recognised that human milk is protective against NEC (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>If enteral iron supplementation is accepted as being a beneficial intervention, the optimum dose, time of initiation and duration of treatment need to be defined.</P>

We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as: </LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.  </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Selective reporting bias. For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcome(s) were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; and the study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Other sources of bias. For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at a:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk; or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1990</LINK>) only specified a birth weight cut-off (&lt; 1500 g), but most of the infants included were likely to have been premature.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies assessed the effect of iron supplementation (generally between 2 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron) versus placebo or no supplement. A number of the trials undertaken before the mid-1960s prescribed much higher doses of iron: <LINK REF="STD-Coles-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Coles 1954</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hanninen-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Hanninen 1961</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Quilligan-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Quilligan 1954</LINK> all used more than 10 mg/kg/day, and in one trial up to 44 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Coles-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Coles 1954</LINK>). Iron supplementation was usually commenced between four and six weeks postnatally, although the time of commencement was often defined by the establishment of enteral feeding, such that the target or mean postnatal age of commencement was not published. Four trials compared earlier (from about two to three postnatal weeks) versus later (about eight weeks) introduction of iron supplements (<LINK REF="STD-Arnon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Arnon 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halliday-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Halliday 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Jansson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinmacher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Steinmacher 2007</LINK>). Three trials compared "high" doses versus "standard" doses of iron supplementation but there was variation in the definition of dose. Specifically, <LINK REF="STD-Friel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friel 2001</LINK> compared 3.4 mg/kg/day versus 2.1 mg/kg/day; <LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1990</LINK> compared 4 mg/kg/day versus 2 mg/kg/day; and <LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK> compared 7.1 mg/kg/day of iron versus 3.6 mg/kg/day. <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2010</LINK> compared a low dose (2 mg/kg/day) with a very low dose (1 mg/kg/day).</P>
<P>For the purpose of comparison between trials, we converted all doses of iron into a dose per kilogram body weight per day. The body weight used for this calculation was the published mean birth weight. If a mean birth weight was not provided, we made an estimate based on the reported weights and gestational ages or both, of the infants in the study. For studies of iron fortified infant formulas, we often had to make an estimate of the daily intake of formula; we applied the estimate of 160 ml/kg/day to all the relevant studies.</P>

Eight reported anthropometric data, usually weight gain, as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferlin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quilligan-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Quilligan 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reedy-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Reedy 1952</LINK>). Most trials reported only short term (up to four to six months corrected age) haematological parameters as the primary outcomes. None of the trials reported neonatal mortality, and quantitative measures of other neonatal morbidities were not reported by most studies.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-19 21:49:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of enteral iron supplementation on the neurodevelopmental and long term growth outcomes for preterm and low birth weight infants. No RCT comparing enteral iron supplementation with no iron supplementation examined the comparative neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
<P>Enteral iron supplementation of both preterm and term low birth weight infants appears to confer a slight improvement in haemoglobin and ferritin levels after eight weeks postnatal age, and reduces the risk of infants developing anaemia. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the outcomes of the included RCTs, which is likely due to a number of methodological issues outlined below.</P>
<P>This review did not identify any benefit in providing more than 2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron. Some recent evidence supports provision of iron supplementation to all low birth weight infants, whether they are born term or preterm (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2010</LINK>).</P>

One further study comparing a standard dose of iron supplementation with a higher dose examined the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants, and did not find any difference up to 12 months of age (<LINK REF="STD-Friel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friel 2001</LINK>). A number of studies measured weight and/or length and head circumference, but in all cases this was only done for the duration of monitoring of haematological parameters, which for most studies was well under a year postnatally.</P>
<P>Most studies were concerned primarily with assessing the effects of iron supplementation on haematological parameters such as haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels. However, only a small number of studies were able to be quantitatively synthesised, because appropriate data was not available, despite attempting to contact the authors for further data. The studies included were very heterogeneous, in relation to the population, the intervention used, the outcomes measured and the results themselves. Qualitatively, the evidence to date indicates that the provision of enteral iron supplementation to premature and term, low birth weight infants probably confers a slight benefit for the haemoglobin level from approximately two months postnatally. Iron stores, reflected in the serum ferritin, are also slightly benefited by iron supplementation. One recent, relatively large RCT has suggested that an early (two weeks postnatal) commencement of iron supplementation results in improved haematological parameters compared with later (four weeks) introduction of iron (<LINK REF="STD-Arnon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Arnon 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>The methodological quality of most of the RCTs was fair at best. For example, only eight of the 26 studies are known to have used allocation concealment of adequate quality. Most failed to report adequate blinding of intervention and outcome measurement, and only eight of 26 had documented follow-up rates of more than 80% for the key outcomes at the end of the study. Other methodological weaknesses were contamination of non iron-supplemented groups by iron-fortified formulas (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Jansson 1979</LINK>) and removal of anaemic infants from analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Coles-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Coles 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorten-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Gorten 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melhorn-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Melhorn 1971</LINK>). Since most of these removals came from the control (unsupplemented) groups, this is likely to have resulted in an underestimation of the effect of iron supplementation on haemoglobin levels.</P>
<P>There was also a paucity of outcome data reported for possible morbidity associated with iron supplementation, such as necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic neonatal lung disease. Rather, the studies looking at adverse effects of iron supplementation concentrated on haematological measures such as evidence of red cell fragility or haemolysis.</P>
<P>Of the studies comparing enteral iron supplementation versus no iron supplementation, there was some variation in the doses of iron administered. The most common dose of iron (either as a medicinal supplement or as formula fortification) was 2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, which was the dose administered in 11 of those 21 studies. This review did not find any evidence that a dose greater than that recommended by the AAP (2 mg/kg/day) results in improvement of outcomes. This is reflected both in the results of studies that specifically addressed this question (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Friel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groh_x002d_Wargo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Groh-Wargo 1990</LINK>) and in the subgroup analysis of trials using doses of iron of 2 mg/kg/day or less compared with those using a higher dose, meta-analysis of which actually indicated a small but statistically significant benefit for haemoglobin at six to eight weeks and three to four months in the 'low iron' but not the 'high iron' group.</P>
<P>A few features of the heterogeneity of study methods are worthy of further comment. First, studies varied greatly in their approach to blood transfusion. For example, among the 21 studies comparing enteral iron supplementation with no (or minimal) iron supplementation, four permitted blood transfusions among the participants before and during the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sankar 2009</LINK>). Two studies permitted transfusions before, but not after study entry (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Griffin 1999</LINK>). The other studies either excluded all infants who required transfusion (7 studies), or did not state any policy (eight studies). The effect of this heterogeneity could be important, given the iron content of blood, and previous research which has suggested that premature babies who receive multiple transfusions are at risk of iron overload (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2001</LINK>). It is feasible that extremely preterm infants who receive one or more blood transfusions may not receive as much benefit from iron supplementation as more mature infants who do not receive any transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>One author suggests that the measurement of ferritin levels in preterm neonates who have received transfusions may be useful to guide the initiation of iron therapy, but again this remains untested (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>). Of the nine studies comparing iron with no iron that were known or estimated to have a mean birth weight of less than 1500 g (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferlin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Griffin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melnick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Melnick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolph-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolph 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sankar 2009</LINK>), five of these studies <LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Franz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Griffin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sankar 2009</LINK>) included infants who had received blood transfusions prior to commencement of the intervention and two studies did not state the policy on transfusions (<LINK REF="STD-Melnick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Melnick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolph-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolph 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, the provision or otherwise of vitamin E supplementation varied between the studies. Apart from the two studies which investigated the supplementation of vitamin E as a controlled intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Ferlin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melhorn-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Melhorn 1971</LINK>), five other studies reported vitamin E supplementation of both the intervention and control groups, ranging from 2 IU/kg/day to 20 IU/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolph-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolph 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sankar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sankar 2009</LINK>). The heterogeneity and uncertainty around the provision or otherwise of vitamin E in these studies is unlikely to have resulted in a significant adverse impact on the review's validity. For example, the finding by <LINK REF="STD-Melhorn-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Melhorn 1971</LINK> that iron supplementation exacerbates the 'early' anaemia of prematurity (i.e. at six to eight weeks postnatally) was not supported by the other trials in this review. In the studies in which the presence or absence of vitamin E supplementation was not documented, it is unlikely, particularly in the studies from the 1950s and 1960s, that it had been given. In most modern neonatal units, a small vitamin E supplement is routinely given to preterm infants, in accordance with AAP recommendations of 5 IU to 25 IU per day (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1985</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Melhorn-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Melhorn 1971</LINK>, the apparent deleterious effect of iron supplementation was ameliorated by vitamin E supplementation. Therefore, any residual concern that iron might exacerbate the early anaemia of pregnancy in non-vitamin E supplemented infants is unlikely to be relevant today.</P>
<P>Third, the provision of enteral cobalt was examined in three studies from the 1950s. No clear picture of its utility for haematological outcome emerged. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Coles-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Coles 1954</LINK> suggested the conferring of a slight benefit for haemoglobin level by the addition of cobalt supplementation at two months, but this was smaller in magnitude, duration and statistical significance than that given by iron supplementation. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 1958</LINK> appeared to show a slight benefit also, but was of poor quality. In <LINK REF="STD-Quilligan-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Quilligan 1954</LINK> there was no comparison with iron alone, and so no conclusion can be drawn about the additive effect of cobalt.</P>

<P>There is a paucity of evidence from RCTs about how enteral iron supplementation of preterm and low birth weight infants affects growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, there appear to be slight haematological benefits after eight weeks postnatal age. Doses of more than 2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day of iron do not appear to confer extra benefit. One recent trial suggests that commencing iron early (at two weeks of age) results in improved haematological parameters from as early as eight weeks of age. The RCT evidence to date does not suggest a particular threshold of birth weight or gestational age at which iron supplementation becomes beneficial, and two of the more recent and methodologically sound trials suggest a benefit even for marginally low birth weight infants, whether term or preterm.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-12 15:37:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for new RCTs of enteral iron supplementation in preterm infants that stratify according to birth weight and gestation, feeding method (breast milk or formula) and prior blood transfusion. This is because it remains unclear from RCT evidence to date whether enteral iron supplementation is required, or indeed might cause harm, in the very low birth weight or extremely low birth weight preterm infant who has already received a blood transfusion. There are strong arguments on a physiological basis that supplementation might only be required in non-transfused infants, but this has not been satisfactorily tested to date.</P>

Your questions, followed by our response appear below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.You state that a randomization schedule was sent to each site.&lt;br&gt;Can you please confirm how the randomization was generated (e.g. computer, table). The randomization was computer-generated.&lt;br&gt;2.Can you confirm if, and how, the random allocation was concealed&lt;br&gt;from those who were entering infants into the study, e.g. opaque envelopes containing a coded group. Randomization of study participants at each clinical site was accomplished in the following manner: the sponsor supplied each investigative site with 4 sets of sealed envelopes containing product codes. The sets were designated for 1) males with a birth weight ?1000 g, 2) males with a birth weight &amp;gt;1000 g, 3) females with a birth weight ?1000 g, and 4) females with a birth weight &amp;gt;1000 g. When a preterm infant was deemed eligible for enrollment into the study, the Investigator or his/her designee retrieved the next envelope in sequence from the appropriate set based on the gender and birth weight of the infant. The sealed envelope was then opened to reveal the product code of the fortifier that the participant would receive. &lt;br&gt;3.You state that the trial was double-blind. Can you please&lt;br&gt;confirm how the blinding was achieved (e.g. unlabelled, coded tins). Each study product was divided into 2 sub-batches and a randomly generated product code was assigned to each of these sub-batches. As the original packaging of the control product was somewhat different than that of the test product, each packet of clinical product was overwrapped with an identical paper wrapping firmly affixed to the original packet. This helped to insure blinding of the study products. Each overwrapped packet was labeled with a plain paper clinical label that identified the product code. Each carton containing 100 packets of clinical product was also identified by the product code and contained information on the preparation and use of the product. The labels were color-coded by product code to assist the Investigator in dispensing the appropriate product as per the randomization schedule to each participant. &lt;br&gt;4.Can you please confirm if the outcome assessors (those taking&lt;br&gt;growth measurements and lab personnel) were blind? Yes, the outcome assessors were blinded to the identity of the study fortifiers.&lt;br&gt;5.For the purpose of our planned meta-analysis, it is useful for&lt;br&gt;us to have the results in the form of means and standard deviations.

I.e., at the time of randomization it was possible to see to which group the following patient would be allocated. We did not know better at that time... - very unfortunate, because doing it correctly would have been so easy...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad 2:&lt;br&gt;Blinding&lt;br&gt;The study participants (preterm infants) were certainly not aware of their treatment... It is impossible to blind iron administration at the doses used in our study to the hospital staff (because it becomes obvious in the stools of the infants)... The primary outcome variables were biochemical variables, which were determined by personnel that was absolutely unaware of the patient's group assigment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad 3:&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;... will follow...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad 4:&lt;br&gt;other trials on iron supplementation&lt;br&gt;I am currently not involved in any trial comparing different strategies of enteral iron supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate if you could send both your review protocol and the list of studies you will review ( I assure that I will use this information&lt;br&gt;confidentially!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes for your work.&lt;br&gt;With kind regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axel Franz&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-01-22 15:37:03 -0500" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
