<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The 2010 version includes five new studies. One of these five had been previously excluded. We have also now excluded studies evaluating Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and other 'packages of care', which will be covered in a separate review. The latter decision was based on an updated definition of integration which regards packages of care as an intervention which can be delivered vertically with specialised support and resources, or horizontally fully integrated into primary health care (PHC). So the package per se is not a form of integration.</P>
<P>The update also incorporates literature related to a new donor word, "linkages". The range of service delivery areas covered in the new review is wider and includes TB, HIV, STI and reproductive health service integration. This reflects the new research. </P>
<P>Authorship has changed as all previous authors were not available to conduct the update.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:13:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In some low- and middle-income countries, healthcare services are organised around a specific health problem. This can cause fragmentation as people are required to visit separate clinics depending on their health problem or need. The logic is that specialist clinics lead to better care and health outcomes because skilled healthcare providers then provide the specialised services and technologies related to the healthcare need. On the other hand, separating out services for specific diseases can be inefficient for both the provider, with service duplication, and the patient who has to visit different services for their health care. For example, a mother has to go to one clinic for family planning services and another for her children to be vaccinated, or a person with HIV and TB has to go to separate clinics for each disease.</P>
<P>One solution is to integrate healthcare services at the point of delivery or to strengthen the linkages between the services. The purpose of integration is to improve co-ordination and service delivery by providing services together, for example services for mothers and their children in one centre. It is believed that integration ensures that services are managed and delivered together, for an efficient and high quality service. It is also believed that integration of care leads to greater public access, including more equitable access for people from different communities and socio-economic backgrounds, a more convenient and satisfying service, and better health overall. Others believe that, with integration of care, healthcare professionals might become overloaded or not have the specialised skills to manage specific diseases, which could lead to poor quality services and poor health.</P>
<P>This updated review included nine studies that evaluated integrated care or linkages in care. The studies made two types of comparison.</P>
<P>1) Integration of care, by adding a service to an existing service (tuberculosis (TB) or sexually transmitted infection (STI) patients were offered HIV testing and counselling; mothers attending an immunisation clinic were encouraged to have family planning services).</P>
<P>2) Integrated services versus single, special services (family planning, maternal and child health delivered as a special vertical programme or integrated into routine healthcare delivery).</P>
<P>There was some evidence from the included studies that adding on services or creating linkages to an existing service improved its use and delivery of health care but little or no evidence that fuller integration of primary healthcare services improved people's health status in low- or middle-income countries. People should be aware that integration may not improve service delivery or health status.If policy makers and planners consider integrating healthcare services they should monitor and evaluate them using good study designs.</P>

<P>In some low- and middle-income countries, separate vertical programmes deliver specific life-saving interventions but can fragment services. Strategies to integrate services aim to bring together inputs, organisation, and delivery of particular functions to increase efficiency and people's access.

<P>Randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses of integration strategies, including strengthening linkages, in primary health care services.

<P>Four studies compared integrated services to single, special services.

<P>There is some evidence that 'adding on' services (or linkages) may improve the utilisation and outputs of healthcare delivery.

More rigorous studies of different strategies to promote integration over a wider range of services and settings are needed.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Horizontal and vertical systems</HEADING>
<P>Health care, even at the first contact level, is complicated. The outputs are diverse, tailored to specific health needs, and dependent on the inputs of different groups of providers, some of whom are specialised in managing certain groups of diseases or patients. Thus a quality health service in part depends on components of the service being 'specialised'. In first contact care in low- and middle-income countries this plays out in its most extreme form as series of 'vertical' programmes with resources, staff and activities contained within each silo, such as in family planning, malaria control, tuberculosis control, HIV prevention and treatment, and delivery of vaccines to prevent common childhood illnesses. There are advantages to this approach in countries where the publicly funded healthcare system is relatively weak as specialised, vertical programmes allow for central technical supervision, dedicated resources, and direct monitoring and evaluation to ensure performance. This approach is therefore thought to assure delivery of services.</P>
<P>On the other hand vertical systems of delivery have disadvantages. They can be extremely inefficient, with service duplication and fragmentation. The public are confronted with an array of different publicly funded activities occurring at different times and in different ways. Health managers may also find it difficult to work effectively as communication is poor between the groups; and training, supervision, drug supplies, and reporting systems are duplicated. In addition, where the imperative to deliver is very strong among external donors who fund programmes, the programmes may employ people with better conditions of service than in government services. This drains skilled and scarce human resources from the routine services. The desire by governments to meet donors' performance requirements for their programmes may also result in the prioritisation of these programmes and cause shifts in management and other support that favours vertical programmes and adversely affects the routine services.</P>
<P>Since the 1960s, debates about the comparative advantages and disadvantages of horizontal and vertical system approaches have often been polarised by the philosophical beliefs of proponents in each camp (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisner 1988</LINK>). The debates have endured to this day, with the belief among some that integration of services is important to improve the efficiency of the health system and the quality of health care for the public.</P>
<P>The strategy of integration of primary health care (PHC) has received renewed attention in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Frenk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frenk 2009</LINK>). An emerging school of thought is that the delivery of vertical programmes and the provision of comprehensive healthcare services are not  mutually exclusive. Rather they are complementary approaches within a continuum of care in complex healthcare delivery environments which require effective planning, co-ordination and management (<LINK REF="REF-Unger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerber 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bundles of cost-effective strategies</HEADING>
<P>'Integration' is used in slightly different ways by various authors. With the advent of evidence-informed approaches, better assessment and quantification of the various ingredients of first contact care have become available. For example, Bhutta and colleagues identified 37 key interventions and strategies from systematic reviews for the delivery of maternal, child and newborn health and survival interventions through primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2008</LINK>). In this context integration is used to describe how to deliver a bundle of cost-effective strategies (in child health or maternal health, for example) through the existing primary healthcare system (<LINK REF="REF-Ekman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekman 2008</LINK>). Nevertheless, this still conforms to a model of integration as a way of delivering a series of targeted technologies and interventions together that sometimes have been delivered as a series of 'vertical' programmes (in malaria, tuberculosis or the extended immunisation of childhood illnesses, for example). This is similar to the delivery of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, which may be delivered as a fully integrated part of routine PHC or in some settings as a 'vertical' programme (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Another example is neglected tropical disease programmes in which integration is seen as these programmes working together with the much larger programmes of malaria control and HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Gyapong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyapong 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Linkages between programmes</HEADING>
<P>A further level of complexity has been added with the renewed popularity of the term 'linkages'. This term was used originally to describe the lowest level of integration. It preceded &#8216;co-ordination&#8217; and &#8216;full integration&#8217;, which were seen as more advanced forms of integration of health and social services (<LINK REF="REF-Leutz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leutz 1999</LINK>). Linkages were based on sharing of information on request and efficient referral systems between different service providers. Co-ordination is a more structured form of integration than linkage that includes features such as the use of a common information system, dedicated staff to improve links between different service providers (discharge planners, for example) but still operates largely through separate structures. 'Full integration' creates new services where resources from multiple systems are pooled. In the reproductive health field, terms such as 'linkages' are being used increasingly to describe and advocate for the integration of services. </P>
<P>A recently published policy brief from WHO and other multilateral donors advocates linkages in sexual and reproductive health (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_HIV_x002f_2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/HIV/2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>This policy document is based on a systematic review, which as of June 2011 was unavailable. The policy brief concludes that the evidence from the systematic review shows that linkages lead to a reduction in HIV-related stigma and discrimination and a better understanding and protection of individuals' rights. A 2010 publication, based on a subset of the papers included in the policy brief, more generally advocates for linkages, and concludes that existing evidence provides support for linkages. It further states that although significant gaps in the literature remain, policy makers, programme managers, and researchers should continue to advocate for, support, implement and rigorously evaluate sexual and reproductive health and HIV linkages (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2010</LINK>). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention  </HEADING>
<P>To illustrate the variety of settings and services in which integration is used in relation to health in low- and middle-income countries, and to help us reach a working definition, we searched MEDLINE and Popline using general search terms such as 'integration', &#8216;linkages&#8217; and 'health care delivery'. We contacted WHO and studied existing reviews to identify a variety of studies, case studies and descriptive reports describing integration at the primary healthcare level. A fuller analysis of these was previously conducted (Capdegelle 1999) and helped us develop our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Several models and descriptions of integration have been presented in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Capdegelle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capdegelle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leutz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leutz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_HIV_x002f_2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/HIV/2008</LINK>);</P>
<P>1. integration at the level of service delivery;</P>
<P>2. integration of management (planning, resource allocation, training and supervision, information systems); and</P>
<P>3. integration of organisations (co-ordination between providers, inter-sectoral co-ordination, and communities) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ekman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekman 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focused on studies of integration at the level of service delivery.</P>
<P>Some examples of integration of service delivery that we identified include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sexually transmitted disease treatment services integrated with provision of family planning;</LI>
<LI>HIV education integrated with family planning;</LI>
<LI>Immunisation programmes integrated within primary care services;</LI>
<LI>HIV counselling and testing integrated into TB programmes; ;</LI>
<LI>TB control integrated with leprosy control;</LI>
<LI>Antenatal care and maternal child health (MCH) clinics.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Levels of care:</B>
</P>
<P>Integration may also occur at different levels of health care. For example, integration between family planning and child health in primary health care can be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>exclusively at the facility level where health workers provide health services;</LI>
<LI>at the facility level and in the community. These forms of integration utilise community health workers to raise awareness about services, provide information, and conduct household visits to identify people in need and to carry out some basic monitoring and service delivery.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this review, we are concerned only with primary care, including government or non-government agency primary healthcare services. We excluded studies concerned with collaboration between the public and private for-profit sectors, and with hospital inpatient services.</P>
<P>Integration between specialist services in high-income countries with highly sophisticated levels of care may have similar goals to integration in low- and middle-income countries. However, the context is very different to poorer countries and therefore the findings of studies evaluating these programmes may not be applicable in poorer settings. This review therefore excluded studies conducted in high-income countries, as defined by the World Bank (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2001</LINK>) (details at <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org/">www.worldbank.org</A>).</P>
<P>
<B>Packages of care: </B>
</P>
<P>Some packages of care are described as integrated. Thus nutrition programmes which include a multiple array of inputs may be called an 'integrated nutrition programme'. However, they are generally implemented as a single vertical programme with several activities and are not strategies to promote integration. Similarly, the World Health Organization/UNICEF strategy 'Integrated Management of Childhood Illness' (IMCI) strategy started initially as an attempt to package case management care obtained from a series of vertical programmes (diarrhoeal disease control, acute respiratory tract infection, malaria, and nutrition) but grew to encompass prevention through immunisation, improved referral and health education (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). This review focuses on the integration of vertical programmes into general health services at the point of delivery. We have therefore excluded &#8216;packages&#8217; of care such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)and integrated nutrition programmes. IMCI has been evaluated in field trials and is the subject of a separate, forthcoming Cochrane review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work  </HEADING>
<P>The present review is concerned with integration and strengthening linkages at the point of delivery. In such initiatives, providers are aiming to bring together several service functions, increase service coherence, and reduce fragmentation. For example, patients with particular health issues are often required to visit different clinics and services, which entails multiple journeys and wasted time. Here the purpose of integration is to provide services delivered together around a particular client group's needs, for example a sexually transmitted infection service (STI) combined with provision of contraceptives (family planning) or integrating services for mothers and their children. Improved efficiency at the point of delivery will include efficiency from the provider view point (in terms of better outputs for similar inputs and increased service utilisation) and from the user perspective (service more accessible or user friendly, for example). It is important to explore whether strategies that promote integrated delivery improve the efficiency of services and have an impact on health status. In areas where the public health system is relatively weak, targeted, vertical programmes may well have advantages in that they ensure delivery of a life saving technology; whereas integrated programmes with increased complexity may actually be less effective in delivering the services.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Integration aims to improve the services in relation to efficiency and access, thereby maximising use of resources and opportunities. For example, a primary healthcare unit is expected to cure people (using staff, procedures, and drugs); deliver vaccines (with effective cold chains, immunisation schedules, and information systems to ensure coverage); and provide reproductive health services (requiring expertise in family planning methods, skills in advising people, treatment of STIs and provision of effective follow up). Strategies to promote integration and linkages would ensure that these services were managed together to maximise efficiency and to increase opportunities for accessing the service. Thus the main intended outcomes of integration are improved efficiency, increased access to health services, improved satisfaction with care, and better health status overall.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this update of the review</HEADING>
<P>Initiatives to revitalize primary health care advocate integration as a key element of such renewal (<LINK REF="REF-Frenk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frenk 2009</LINK>). Previous versions of this review have found limited rigorous evidence to inform decision making of the effectiveness of integration strategies . and advocated that further rigorous studies be conducted. This update seeks to identify, evaluate and include any new evidence on integration to inform policy making and planning of health care in low- and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>The reasons for the original review were that a wider range of services can be offered through integration and strengthened linkages, which could reduce differences in access and utilisation of health services between geographic areas and socio-economic groups, leading to greater equity (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). Increased convenience for users may also lead to their increased satisfaction with services. Furthermore, some experts believe that integrated services are more likely to be sustainable, in the long term, than vertical programmes and can improve health overall (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). However, such strategies may have unintended and unwanted outcomes; for example, health workers becoming overloaded or deskilled. Their ability and capacity to deliver specific technical services may be impaired , the quality of services may decline, service goals may not be achieved its goals and health outcomes may deteriorate. Integrated strategies may also increase the cost of service provision.</P>
<P>Given these debates, an update of this review was needed. We have revised the text and inclusion criteria to take into account the shifts in definitions of integration. We have also included the new term 'linkages', as a form of integration at the point of delivery, particularly in relation to the policy debates in TB, HIV and reproductive health.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), non-randomised controlled trials (NRCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS). A NRCT was defined as a study that allocated units to intervention and control groups using methods that are not random. A CBA study was defined as one in which observations were made before and after the implementation of an intervention, both in a group that received the intervention and a control group that did not. CBA studies needed to include a minimum of two intervention and two control sites that were comparable, and contemporaneous data collection. To be eligible for inclusion, ITS studies needed to evaluate a change attributable to the intervention, have a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred and have at least three data points before and three after the intervention.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:13:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review, the units of study are the sites where primary care is delivered (healthcare facilities or clinics). Studies including any providers of primary health care were eligible for inclusion. For example, providers in publicly managed services (either free health services or with systems of cost recovery); in non-governmental organisations; or in private organisations delivering services, for any kind of health problem. The review excludes studies conducted in high-income countries as defined by the World Bank (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2001</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:13:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any management or organisational change strategy applied to existing systems that aimed to increase integration at the service delivery level in primary health. Primary health care is defined as the patient's first point of access to formal provision of health care, including general outpatient clinics of hospitals. We limited this to ambulatory or outpatient care providing formal primary health care (as the primary contact).</P>
<P>We excluded the following types of studies: those implemented in hospital (apart from general outpatient care) and speciality settings or inpatient care (secondary and tertiary care); those implemented in specialised hospital outpatient clinics; studies integrating service delivery across or between primary, secondary and tertiary care; studies evaluating a public, private for-profit service mix; and studies of ''packages'' of vertical interventions such as IMCI and integrated nutrition programmes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors examined the lists of references generated by the search and retrieved any likely studies. Two authors then independently assessed the retrieved studies for inclusion using a checklist for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria listed above. The methods of selection of studies followed standard guidelines from the EPOC Group (<A HREF="http://www.epoc.uottawa.ca">www.epoc.uottawa.ca</A> ). Disagreements between the review authors regarding study inclusion were resolved by discussion. In the 2005 update, we moved Taylor 1987 from an included study to an excluded study as we were unable to determine how the communities were allocated, and the paper gave no reassurance that this was randomised. Subsequent correspondence with the authors provided sufficient information on the trial design and methods to address the earlier concerns, and the study was included again in the 2010 update.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data extraction was carried out by two authors, based on the EPOC Group's data collection checklist. We extracted standard information about methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. The results from similar integration strategies were grouped together.</P>
<P>All studies were complex in relation to both intervention and the evaluation methods used. We grouped studies into those that were exclusively clinic based and those that also included a substantial community component. We then further divided the studies into those where the researchers simply 'added on' one new function to an existing service, and those that made a more substantive effort to integrate delivery (as opposed to having separate vertical programmes). In studies which had more than one intervention group, but the interventions in these groups were similar, we combined the intervention groups in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>). The study results were not pooled in a meta-analysis as there was considerable heterogeneity in the content, design, settings, and outcomes of the studies. We have therefore presented a narrative summary of the study findings.</P>
<P>Of the four cluster randomised trials included in the review, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>) had adjusted for intra-cluster correlation. Attempts were made to adjust for clustering in the cluster RCT's where this had not been done adequately by the authors. However, insufficient data were available to make these adjustments in the relevant studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huntington-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Huntington 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors assessed the risk of bias in eligible studies using the EPOC risk of bias criteria which has been adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration criteria for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). A GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence was done using GradePro and is reported in summary of findings tables 2-7. Criteria used for assessing the quality of the evidence included: limitations in the design and implementation of the study, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results, imprecision of results, and publication bias.</P>

Most of the interventions included training and additional supervision and support of the health service providers. The service providers were mainly nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>), physicians (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>), lay family health workers or auxiliary health workers (<LINK REF="STD-Tuladhar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuladhar 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1987-_x0028_FP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1987 (FP)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1987-_x0028_Nutrition_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1987 (Nutrition)</LINK>), or an undefined category of service providers (<LINK REF="STD-Huntington-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Huntington 1994</LINK>).

<P>Clinic and community based: the <LINK REF="STD-Tuladhar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuladhar 1982</LINK> study in Nepal evaluated family planning, women's and child health services either through integrated primary preventive services or through a vertical programme, including both facility and community components. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1987-_x0028_FP_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1987</LINK> compared single and multiple (integrated) special services for nutrition and child health; as well as for family planning, women&#8217;s and child health, with routine service delivery, in India. <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK> evaluated an integrated community and clinic based HIV control intervention, in Zimbabwe.</P>
<P>The Narangwal study was a complicated but important exception that seemed to cover several categories. This study examined one question around adding on services and another around vertical versus horizontal provision.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<U>Add-on services:</U> in the first part of the study, two experimental groups were compared with routine services. Inone group nutrition care was added and in the other infection control programmes were added.

</UL>
<UL>
<LI> <U>Vertical versus horizontal provision</U>:<B> </B>The first part of the study examined whether delivering nutrition and infection control programmes together was better than programmes delivering them singly.The second part of the study examined whether delivering family planning, women's and child services packaged together was better than providing them singly.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These different comparisons within Taylor 1987 meant it contributed both to the evaluation of the 'add-on' model and the 'vertical versus horizontal' data set.</P>

The providers were interviewed but they were simply asked if they thought the intervention was having an impact on referrals: the responses suggested that the bulk of providers viewed the intervention as having a positive effect on referrals. Both control and intervention clinics increased the number of EPI doses administered over the study period, suggesting that adding on services did not have a negative effect on the EPI programme (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>), couples attending a voluntary HIV counselling and testing (VCT) centre were offered free non-barrier contraceptives at the centre in addition to routine family planning education and referrals, provided for all clients. The couples offered family planning at the VCT centre had a significantly higher uptake of non-barrier contraceptives at three months (RR 2.39, CI1.74 to 3.29] (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). However, incident pregnancies assessed at 12 months did not differ between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.89, CI 0.53 to 1.48]). High discontinuation rates of non-barrier contraceptives and high rates of oral contraception user failure were recorded. The use of non-barrier contraception was not associated with decreased condom use. Client satisfaction was not assessed (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>In South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 2010</LINK>), provider initiated HIV counselling and testing was added to services at TB clinics and STI clinics, respectively, through the training of health workers and the provision of tests and equipment. The interventions resulted in an increase of HIV counselling (RR 2.69, CI 1.81 to 3.99) and testing (RR 3.12, CI 2.04 to 4.77) for TB, and HIV testing for STI patients (RR 1.23, CI 1.18 to 1.28].(<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>In India (Taylor 1987), two complex interventions linked to family planning and nutrition were assessed. Both used family health workers to provide community based services in addition to routine government health services which served as the control. In one arm of the study the interventions focused on nutrition and infection control, and in the other arm on family planning, women's and child health.</P>
<P>The addition of community based family planning to womens' and child health services improved family planning acceptance as compared to routine services. Women's and child health outcomes were not reported. Using family planning outcomes as a measure of effectiveness, the addition of family planning to maternal and child health was reported as being more cost effective than the routine services (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). However, serious limitations in study design and the early closure of the study makes the evidence of effect very uncertain (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The addition of community based nutrition and infection control interventions improved nutrition indicators, and reduced the duration of illnesses and mortality when compared to the routine service sites (<LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).

<P>In the Tanzania study (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>), different models of delivery of STI services for women at truck stops were evaluated. Peer educators were trained to refer the women with evidence of a STI to three types of service: STI services integrated into routine health facilities (normal working hours); special after hours STI services twice a week; or a special team of clinicians visiting every three months. Utilisation, in terms of attendances per number of women at each truck stop, was similar but slightly higher in special after hours STI services and lower in the integrated services within normal working hours (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>). The proportion of referred women who actually attended the service was similar between the special after hours service and the visiting clinicians, and was significantly lower for the integrated STI service (RR 0.54, CI 0.45 to 0.66). Data on women's satisfaction with the service from a sample survey indicated a preference for the visiting special team (RR 0.84, CI 0.72 to 0.99). Costs per patient treated were similar but were lowest for the integrated STI service (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii. Community and facility</HEADING>
<P>In Nepal (<LINK REF="STD-Tuladhar-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Tuladhar 1982</LINK>), family planning and maternal and child health care were provided either through integrated primary health care services or through a vertical family planning, maternal and child health programme. Both approaches included facility based services and community components. Outcomes measured related to the delivery of the family planning programme (current use of contraceptives, knowledge of family planning, and intention to use family planning) and the impact on health status (infant mortality and child survival). The data on family planning showed that there was low overall use, and a secular modest increase between 1975 and 1978, but no difference between the two modes of delivery (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). However, knowledge of family planning was higher in the vertical programme group although intention to use and the mean number of preferred children showed little difference. Infant mortality rates fell in both groups, with a greater reduction in the vertical sites, over the period of study. There was little change in child survivorship, in both sites (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Taylor 1987 family planning study also compared the integrated package of family planning, child and women&#8217;s health to three vertical style programmes of child health and family planning; women&#8217;s health and family planning; and family planning education alone. Although family planning acceptance increased in all intervention sites, the levels of increase were similar at the different sites (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). However, serious limitations in study design makes the evidence of effect uncertain. The effects on children's and women&#8217;s health were not reported. The integrated package was reported to be more cost-effective than the single interventions in achieving family planning outcomes including uptake, years of protection, and births averted (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the nutrition arm of the Taylor 1987 study, a comparison was made of an integrated package of nutrition and health care for infectious diseases to a nutrition intervention alone, and health care for infectious diseases alone. Child and infant mortality rates were decreased with all three intervention packages, compared to controls, but no difference was found between the single and combined interventions (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>). However, serious limitations in study design makes the evidence of effect uncertain. Comparisons of morbidity outcomes between the intervention packages were not reported.</P>
<P>In Zimbabwe, <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK> evaluated a complex intervention which included facility and community based activities implemented over a three year period to improve HIV control. The activities included peer education and condom distribution to targeted groups, strengthened STI services, clinic open days with HIV/AIDS information, education and communication, and income generating projects. A wide range of outcomes was reported, many of which demonstrated little or no effect of the intervention. Positive changes that were noted included improved STI treatment effectiveness in men (self reported) (prevalence odds ratio (POR) 2.49, CI 1.22 to 5.10), and improved HIV/AIDS knowledge in men (POR 1.30, CI 1.08 to 1.55). This was not accompanied by behavioural changes, however, with no evidence of an effect on multiple casual partners (POR 1.13, CI 0.88 to 1.46) and an increase in reported unprotected sex with casual partners for men (POR 1.46, CI 1.02 to 2.09) and women (POR 6.51, CI 2.14 to 19.82). There was no change in health seeking behaviour in men or women, and no effect on reported STI (POR 1.41, CI 0.94 to 2.12) in men or women (POR 1.10, CI 0.9 to 1.35) or HIV incidence in the study population (IRR 1.27, CI 0.92 to 1.75) (<LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although user&#8217;s knowledge and intentions were assessed in several of the family planning integration studies, user&#8217;s views on integrated service delivery were not ascertained. Providers' views, assessed in Huntington 1994, were limited to evaluating the family planning messages and whether this impacted on service uptake.</P>
<P>In the Tanzania study of STI services for women at truck stops (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>) , the special STI services (after hours and outreach) were preferred by women, as reflected in attendance rates and a user satisfaction survey of a small sample (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>). </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluations of integration</HEADING>
<P>Two studies included some form of costing or economic evaluation. The methods of the economic evaluations were not described in either of these studies, and very little data were presented. The reported results therefore need to be interpreted with caution. Taylor 1987 reported lower unit costs (cost per acceptor) for combined family planning service delivery, with the integration of family planning, child and women&#8217;s health being the most cost effective option (USD35 per estimated birth averted) as compared to family planning education alone (USD107 per estimated birth averted) (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>). In the nutrition study of Taylor 1987, integrated health care and nutrition were reported to be the most cost effective in improving growth and psychomotor development .</P>
<P>In the STI services study in Tanzania (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>), the cost per patient treated was lower for STI care integrated in the general PHC services (USD11.00 per case) than in the special after hours STI clinics (USD11.5) and special outreach STI clinics (USD12.0) (Table 8). The costing was not however linked to any of the outcome measures to assess cost-effectiveness of the different approaches. The only conclusion that can be drawn is therefore that the costs per patient treated for an STI in 1997 in Tanzania were lower for integrated STI care than for the special STI services.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:30:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>After three decades of research on vertical and integrated service delivery there is some evidence of efficiency gains of integration, particularly in family planning integration (<LINK REF="STD-Huntington-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Huntington 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>), HIV testing in TB and STI services (<LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 2010</LINK>), and STI treatment effectiveness in integrated HIV control (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>). However, there is also evidence that in certain contexts vertical programmes perform better than fully integrated services for STI treatment, and no evidence that integration improves health outcomes. Recent studies have been more rigorous and are producing better quality evidence. However, further well designed studies of different strategies to promote integration, and the effects of integration over a wider range of service areas and settings, are needed.Very limited costing data were available in the studies included in the review, and good quality economic evaluations of integration are needed to assess cost-effectiveness and the efficiency of service integration.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Add on of services</HEADING>
<P>The results of the studies of service add ons or linkages at a facility level indicate that these interventions probably improve utilisation of services, in particular family planning and HIV counselling and testing. None of these studies, however, provided evidence of improvements in health status outcomes as a result of the add-on services, and none assessed client satisfaction with add-on services. The goals of integration include not only improved utilisation and efficiency of delivery of care but also improved patient satisfaction and health status. The absence of evidence of effect on patient satisfaction and health status suggests that some caution is necessary in implementing these interventions as improvements in the ''processes' of healthcare delivery may not translate automatically into improved patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.</P>
<P>The addition of community based interventions for family planning improved family planning uptake, and the addition of community based nutrition and child health interventions improved child nutrition, morbidity and mortality (Taylor 1987). However, the quality of the evidence from the Taylor studies was very low , and the true effect is uncertain. It is also important to note that these additional interventions involved lay health workers providing services in the community, with support from the routine facility based services. Any differences between control and intervention sites may therefore be due to the additional community based services as well as the integration across levels of care, as has been demonstrated elsewhere (<LINK REF="STD-Baqui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Baqui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vertical versus integrated service delivery</HEADING>
<P>The study of models of STI care (<LINK REF="STD-Nyamuryekung_x0027_e-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nyamuryekung'e 1997</LINK>) produced results which favoured the delivery of special or vertical services for STIs in the study context. </P>
<P>The preference for and higher utilisation rates of special after hours and outreach STI services by women at truck stops may reflect a desire for privacy and confidentiality as well as better access to STI services at times and places which are more convenient for these users. These findings may be relevant to similar target groups where privacy or confidentiality are an important concern for the service users, and may not be applicable to other types of services. However, the study does indicate that integrated services may not necessarily be the preferred option of all service users.</P>
<P>Of the integration studies which included facility and community components, the Tuladhar 1982 and Taylor 1987 studies of vertical versus integrated family planning services did not demonstrate any differences in health delivery or health status outcomes.</P>
<P>The integrated nutrition and healthcare intervention (Taylor 1987) found no effect on mortality between the single and combined interventions. The main impact on processes of healthcare delivery and health outcomes in the Taylor study therefore appeared to occur through adding on or linking a community based intervention to the routine services. Whether this was delivered as a single focus intervention (for example nutrition or health care alone) or a combined package of two or more interventions appears to have not resulted in any difference in effect on the outcomes measured.</P>
<P>The more recent well designed cluster RCT of a complex integrated community and clinic based HIV control intervention in Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>) found improvements in some health service outcomes, in particular improved STI treatment effectiveness in men. However, improved knowledge of HIV/AIDS in the men did not translate into positive behaviour changes, nor into reduced HIV and STI incidence in the study population. The study also found harmful effects in that both men and women reported increased unprotected sex with casual partners in the intervention sites. The authors explored several reasons for the failure of the intervention to achieve the intended effects. Key factors were the stage of the epidemic, which was on the decline in Zimbabwe; possible contamination by other HIV prevention and control interventions in the control sites; and the limitations of the relatively short follow-up period to capture long-term changes.</P>
<P>The three studies of facility and community based integration therefore provide conflicting results, with improved health knowledge and healthcare delivery in vertical sites in Tuladhar 1982, no evidence of effect in Taylor 1987, and mixed results in Gregson 2007. None of these three studies demonstrated an improvement in health status outcomes in the integrated service delivery sites.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The studies covered a narrow range of service delivery areas, with four of the studies assessing family planning linkages with, or integration into, other services. Other services assessed included nutrition and child health, STI treatment, TB and HIV service integration. Overall, the limited focus of studies of integration probably reflect historical policy pushes. In the 1980s, international policy makers were seeking approaches to integrate family planning programmes with child health (<LINK REF="REF-Lush-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lush 1999</LINK>). In the late 1990s, efforts were being made to provide accessible STI services for sex workers; and the World Health Organization has since been promoting a substantive package of interventions for child health, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). In the current decade the focus has been on integrating and creating linkages with sexual health, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS services (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_HIV_x002f_2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/HIV/2008</LINK>), as well as the integration of TB and HIV/AIDS prevention and care.</P>
<P>The interventions mainly involved changes in delivery arrangements, particularly professional changes such as the training and support of existing health workers to provide additional information or services; or services provided in a different location or by an additional category of health worker. None of the studies assessed interventions which involved financing or governance arrangements to support integrated service delivery.</P>
<P>The actual mechanism of the integration strategy was well described in the more recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 2010</LINK>) but vague in several of the earlier studies. In particular the nature of inputs such as the categories of health professionals involved, training provided, duration of the intervention, and any additional resources were poorly specified. The evaluation of integration strategies is difficult because of problems in the development, identification, documentation, and reproduction of the interventions in different settings (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>). This is why it is important that the integration strategy (the intervention) be well defined in order to be able to compare similar interventions. Better description of interventions also enables decision-makers to assess whether the intervention is feasible with the available resources in their settings.</P>
<P>Six of the studies were undertaken in African countries (South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) and three in Asian countries (India and Nepal). The evidence from the studies may therefore be more applicable in similar settings in Africa and Asia, but less so in other settings. </P>
<P>The time period during which the studies were implemented and evaluated ranged from four months (<LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>) to four years (Taylor 1987). Most of the outcomes assessed tended to be short-term process outcomes, such as service utilisation and, in a few instances, longer-term impacts on morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>; Taylor 1987). Although most of the studies were recent, the Tuladhar (1982) and Taylor (1987) studies were conducted more than two decades ago and this may affect the applicability of these findings. </P>
<P>Studies focused almost exclusively on the provider side, without any consideration of the demand side. Only one of the studies examined user views, and this assessment included only a simple 'yes' or 'no' question about satisfaction with the service, in a small sample survey. No study examined user views around the coherence of the service they were using. One of the often cited reasons for integration is that it improves the service for the communities using it. Indeed, this was our starting point for this review of integration interventions - to assess whether they reduced the service fragmentation experienced by users. The views of potential users are likely to influence strongly whether they use the service or not, and future studies should assess this. This review did not search for or include qualitative studies of user views and these may be an important additional source of data on this issue. </P>
<P>From the provider side, managers expressed concern about overloading staff with multiple tasks, and with the inherent risk of none of the services being delivered particularly well. Studies examining this would help to inform management decisions on integration strategies for particular localities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>A total of nine studies were included in this updated review, adding three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Mark-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mark 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pope-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gregson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gregson 2007</LINK>) and a NRCT (<LINK REF="STD-Leon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 2010</LINK>) to the previous evidence. The addition of these recent studies have improved the overall quality of the evidence largely as a result of the improved study designs. The quality of the evidence from these studies were mostly graded as being of moderate or high quality.</P>
<P>By comparison the Tuladhar and the Taylor studies, undertaken three decades ago, were less rigorous. The evidence from these and other previously included studies were graded as low and very low quality using the GRADE approach. The failure to measure any effect in some of these studies may be due partly to numerous biases which were not addressed in the studies. .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>The updated review repeated and extended the earlier search strategy over an extensive range of databases and other sources. The types of studies included in the review were not limited to RCTs, but also included NRCTs, CBAs and ITS studies. There is therefore a high likelihood that all relevant rigorous studies were identified.</P>
<P>The more recently published studies described the study design in detail and reported fully on the data. In earlier studies the description of the study design, the interventions and the reporting of data was incomplete. Study authors were contacted to obtain further information where possible, but to some extent the inclusion, categorisation and assessment of risk of bias for earlier studies may have been biased by poor reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>Although integrated health care continues to be advocated for LMICs, there remains a lack of clear evidence of the benefits of integration (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Atun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atun 2010</LINK>). This updated review identified additional evidence of the effects of integration in terms of the processes of delivery of PHC. However, the review failed to provide evidence that integrated health care impacts positively on health outcomes. A wide variety of strategies can be used to achieve integration (or linkages), and there are a range of settings within which integration could be applied. Reproductive health, HIV and TB are popular areas for studies on integration and linkages but, as this review has illustrated, the evidence is still inconclusive. This is contrary to the recent WHO/UNFPA/IPPF/UNAIDS/UCSF Policy Brief that claims, based on evidence from an unpublished systematic review, that there are clear benefits to integration (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_HIV_x002f_2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/HIV/2008</LINK>). A publication based on the same systematic review advocates for linkages whilst concluding that significant gaps in the literature remain (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A shift has now occurred in the debate on integration to identifying the contexts within which either vertical or integrated programmes may be appropriate, and exploring how best to co-ordinate such programmes with general healthcare services to achieve efficient health service delivery, continuity of care, and optimal health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Unger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Atun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atun 2010</LINK>). This shift does begin to address the contextual nature of strategies, which may work for certain diseases in certain populations, and to address the differences between ''add on'' and full integration approaches. However, with the absence of evidence of an effect of full integration of health care, caution needs to be exercised in advocating any one approach above another.</P>
<P>What is emerging is that integration is a very complex and variably understood concept, with terms such as linkages being used interchangeably with integration, resulting in some confusion. Whatever it is called, integration and linkages are difficult to evaluate in the real world settings of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. To date, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness in improving health outcomes, and some evidence to suggest that it may improve efficiency but may not be appropriate in all circumstances.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:13:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies of 'add-on' services involving discrete interventions at a facility level have been the most successful in demonstrating any benefits in service delivery, but have failed to assess longer-term health benefits. Studies of more complex integration interventions covering facility and community levels have been least successful in demonstrating any benefits of integration, to service delivery or health outcomes. </P>
<P>Increasingly, health decision makers are becoming aware of the importance of using evidence in policy making, and there is therefore a need for reliable research evidence to assist decision makers (<LINK REF="REF-Haines-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haines 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavis 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>However, in the absence of clear evidence that integration improves health outcomes, the way to deliver primary healthcare should remain a choice made by governments and non-government organisations based on logical, common-sense decisions within local contexts and taking into account budgetary and resource constraints. More importantly, decision makers should be aware that integration may not improve service delivery or health outcomes, and they should establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate this if they decide to proceed with integration within a particular setting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-16 08:19:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Integration remains on the international policy agenda for primary health care in LMIC. One of the main justifications for integrated care at the point of delivery is to make the service easier to use and more accessible to the communities served. Yet few impact evaluations assess lay views of the service provided. This is a clear gap that should be addressed in future evaluations, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Such studies should also seek to assess the equity implications of integration of care.</P>
<P>Integration should make the service more economically efficient. However, due to the inadequacies of economic evaluations and reporting in the studies, it is difficult to draw any conclusions on the economic aspects of integration. A more in-depth analysis of the costs is required to draw any conclusions on the economic efficiency or cost-effectiveness of integration.</P>
<P>Overall, international policy developments regarding integration provide an opportunity for further research to explore approaches in a variety of contexts. Policy makers and planners considering integration could introduce strategies and, where appropriate, use rigorous study designs to allow unbiased comparisons.</P>

Pierre Capdegelle conducted an initial overview of the concepts and appraised potentially relevant studies, advised on inclusion of studies, co-extracted the data and co-wrote the protocol and review.</P>
<P>Paul Garner supported the conceptual development of the topic; helped with the protocol, data extraction, data presentation, analysis and interpretation; was commissioned to conduct the review and liaised with the World Health Organization (WHO). Philemona Hinds provided administrative support for the updated review.</P>

<P>The 2010 update includes 'linkages' as part of integration in the inclusion criteria and in the search. The update excludes 'packages'' of care as a mechanism of integration, as such packages can be delivered either as 'vertical' services with special support and resources, or are added or fully integrated into routine care. Studies assessing effectiveness of packages were therefore not included.</P>
