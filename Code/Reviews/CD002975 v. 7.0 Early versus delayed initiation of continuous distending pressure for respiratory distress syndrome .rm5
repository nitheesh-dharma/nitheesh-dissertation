<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-17 15:12:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Premature babies often lack the substance, surfactant, a detergent like substance produced by the lung. This causes their lungs to fail to expand properly at birth, and breathing in requires a big effort. If left untreated, breathing difficulty progressively worsens and it may cause damage to the lung. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) improves the expansion of the lung making it easier for the premature baby to breath. It is applied through a face mask, or into the nostrils or by a partial vacuum outside the chest. When applied early, it may also reduce the lung damage that causes chronic lung disease. Different ways of using CDP were assessed in six controlled trials (four randomized), and it was found that fewer infants who received early CDP had to go on to be treated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation. No adverse effect of early use of CDP was found in these trials. However, there were several limitations to information from the studies, as the number of infants was small and the mean age ranged from seven to eighteen hours old when CDP was applied. Practice has changed from when these studies were done. CDP interventions are applied earlier, and surfactants are commonly given as well. Corticosteroids are given to the fetus before birth (antenatally) to prepare their lungs for birth.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-04 20:54:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The application of continuous distending pressure (CDP) has been shown to have some benefits in the treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). CDP has the potential to reduce lung damage particularly if applied early before atelectasis has occurred. Early application of CDP may better conserve an infant's own surfactant stores and consequently be more effective than CDP applied later in the course of RDS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if early compared with delayed initiation of CDP results in lower mortality and reduced need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation in preterm infants with RDS. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-06 13:14:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to September Week 4, 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal hand searching mainly in the English language.</P>
<P>The electronic search was updated in November 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials which used random or quasi-random allocation to either early or delayed CDP in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used, including independent assessment of trial quality and extraction of data by two authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In six studies on a total of 165 infants, early CDP was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), (typical RR 0.55, typical RD -0.16, NNT 6), but there was no evidence of effect on overall mortality. There was no evidence of effect on the rates of pneumothorax (five studies) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (one study). Early CDP resulted in a reduction in duration of oxygen therapy in the single study reporting this outcome. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Early application of CDP has a clinical benefit in the treatment of RDS in that it reduces subsequent use of IPPV and thus may be useful in preventing the adverse effects of this treatment. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of early CDP in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated focusing on administration methods.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-04 18:49:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-01-04 18:49:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary surfactant deficiency is responsible for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1959</LINK>). This deficiency in surfactant results in low lung volumes, poor lung distensibility and atelectasis. The resulting hypoxia leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right to left shunting (<LINK REF="REF-Gribetz-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gribetz 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1991</LINK>). This exacerbates existing ventilation-perfusion abnormalities. The disease is also characterised by alveolar-capillary leakage, pulmonary oedema, and alveolar cell injury (<LINK REF="REF-Barter-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barter 1960</LINK>). These lead to the formation of hyaline membranes seen on histological examination of diseased lungs.</P>
<P>Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) without a positive end expiratory pressure was the first mode of assisted ventilation used for the treatment of RDS in preterm infants. When it became evident that low lung volume was a consequence of the disease, continuous distending pressure was developed as a means of increasing lung volume and improving oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Gregory-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 1971</LINK>). Positive end expiratory pressure was also found to improve oxygenation in ventilated infants (<LINK REF="REF-Herman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herman 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-04 18:49:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The application of continuous distending pressure (CDP) either as continuous negative distending pressure (CNP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to have some benefits in the treatment of preterm infants with RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2002</LINK>). It was not clear whether the effectiveness of CDP is modified by birth weight or gestational age. However, in babies &lt; 1000 g or &lt; 28 weeks there may be insufficient respiratory drive for them to cope with CDP. Continuous distending pressure applied as nasal CPAP has been established in post-extubation care (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-01-04 18:49:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CDP improves lung function by reducing the work of breathing, normalizing lung volumes and improving ventilation-perfusion mismatch (<LINK REF="REF-Cogswell-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cogswell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Field-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1996</LINK>). CDP also conserves surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Wyszogrodski-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyszogrodski 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verder-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verder 1994</LINK>). It splints the airways during expiration and thus reduces atelectasis in the surfactant-deficient lung (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1990</LINK>). It therefore has the potential to reduce lung damage seen in RDS, particularly if applied early before alveolar collapse occurs. Surfactant, a proven treatment for RDS, is more effective if applied early (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yost-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yost 1999</LINK>) suggesting the hypothesis that CDP by virtue of its properties may also be more effective if applied early.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-01-04 18:47:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of this review is to establish whether the early application of CDP has any benefit over later application in preterm infants with RDS. An earlier review on this subject has been done (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1992</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if early compared with delayed initiation of CDP results in a lower mortality and reduced need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation in preterm infants with RDS. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned a priori on the basis of weight (with subdivisions at 1000 g and 1500 g) and gestation (with subdivisions at 28 and 32 weeks), the type of CDP (CPAP or CNP) and according to whether surfactant was used. Sensitivity analyses based on trial quality were also planned.</P>

<P>Identified trials were reviewed independently by each reviewer for methodological quality. Criteria used for assessment of quality were blinding of randomization, blinding of treatment, completeness of follow-up and blinding of assessment of outcomes. Agreement was reached by consensus. This information was entered into the "Characteristics of Included Studies" Table.</P>
<P>For the updated review in 2009, the Risk of Bias table was completed. The two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The Risk of Bias table addressed the following questions: </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); inadequate (any nonrandom process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or unclear. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or unclear. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed. </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data) or unclear. </P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

<P>Eight studies involving a total of 251 infants were identified. One of these studies identified was the quasi-random study of <LINK REF="STD-John-1976" TYPE="STUDY">John 1976</LINK> and co-workers that excluded patients after allocation who died or required mechanical ventilation. Data on excluded patients were not available; thus, treatment effects on none of the primary outcomes specified in this review are available from this study. This study was excluded. One further study, (<LINK REF="STD-Tooley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tooley 2003</LINK>), involving 42 infants was excluded as infants were randomised after intubation and administration of surfactant to extubation and application of nasal CPAP or continued conventional ventilation.</P>
<P>The included studies were all carried out in the pre-surfactant era (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mockrin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Mockrin 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>). All infants required clinical and radiological evidence of RDS for trial entry. The FiO2 required at entry ranged from 0.3 or more to 0.7 or more. Early CDP was initiated at trial entry and late CDP was initiated if further deterioration occurred at an FiO2 ranging from 0.5 up to 1.0. This FiO2 was given to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen of 50 mm Hg in four studies, 60 in one study and 100 in one study. Thus there was considerable variation and overlap in the criteria used for initiating early and late CDP.</P>
<P>Of the six studies included in the review, two used CNP (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mockrin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Mockrin 1975</LINK>), one used face mask CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>) and three used binasal CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 1981</LINK>) addressed the overall objectives and was included although the criterion for delayed CDP was based on an FiO2 of 0.5 rather than the strict 0.6 prespecified. Post hoc the protocol has been altered to make the criteria less narrow by inserting approximately 0.6 or more in the criteria for delayed CDP.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure for all studies was use of IPPV and mortality. The point in time at which mortality was measured was not specified in any of the studies, although the age of death for each individual death was given in two of the trials. The combined outcome of death before discharge or subsequent use of IPPV was not given in any of the trials. Five studies reported the incidence of pneumothorax (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mockrin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Mockrin 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>), one reported bronchopulmonary dysplasia (undefined) (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>), and one reported retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>) as secondary outcomes. One study did a subgroup analysis of mortality on very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>). Duration of oxygen therapy in survivors (time period of survival not stated) was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>). This was not a prespecified outcome measure but was included post hoc as it was considered an important secondary outcome.</P>

<P>All the studies were controlled trials. Five studies were randomized. Of these five, one (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1975</LINK>) used concealed allocation (sealed envelopes). It was not clear whether the allocation was concealed in the other four studies. One study used random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Mockrin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Mockrin 1975</LINK>) and in two other studies the method of randomisation was not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hegyi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hegyi 1981</LINK> used hospital number to randomize, but the way in which this was done is not clear. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>) was quasi-random in part. They used a sequential design where the first eight matched pairs were randomized to treatment group using sealed envelopes but subsequent infants were allocated alternately.</P>
<P>There was no blinding of the intervention or the outcome assessment in any of the studies. There was complete follow-up of randomised patients in all studies.

<P>
<B>PRIMARY OUTCOMES</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Use of IPPV (Outcome 1.1):</B>
<BR/>None of the six individual trials showed that early vs delayed CDP caused a significant reduction in the requirement for IPPV. However, the meta-analysis of all six trials supports a reduction in use of IPPV in the early CDP group that was statistically significant and clinically important [typical RR 0.55 (0.32, 0.96), RD -0.16 (-0.28, -0.03), NNT 6 (4, 33)].</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by type of CDP was done for the four studies using CPAP and the two studies using CNP. Early CDP caused a significant reduction in use of IPPV in the two studies using CNP [typical RR 0.12 (0.02, 0.85), RD -0.36 (-0.58, -0.14), NNT 3 (2, 7)], but not in the four studies using CPAP [typical RR 0.77 (0.43, 1.38), typical RD -0.08 (-0.23, 0.08)].</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality (Outcome 1.2):</B>
<BR/>Mortality (explicitly specified as mortality prior to discharge) prior to discharge was not reported in any of the studies. For mortality (time not specified) there was no significant effect of early CDP in any of the six individual trials or in the pooled estimate [typical RR 0.68 (0.34, 1.38), typical RD -0.07 (-0.18, 0.04)]. In the subgroup analysis by type of CDP there was no evidence of effect on mortality.</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality at 28 days (Outcome 1.3):</B>
<BR/>There was no significant effect of early CDP on mortality at 28 days in the two studies that reported this [typical RR 0.93(0.13, 6.81)].</P>
<P>Failure<BR/>None of the trials reported failure as we defined it, i.e. death or subsequent use of IPPV.</P>
<P>
<B>SECONDARY OUTCOMES</B>
</P>
<P>There was no significant effect of early CDP on the rate of pneumothorax (outcome 01-04) (five trials) or BPD (Outcome 01-10) at 28 days (one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>). The number of days on oxygen (Outcome 01-05) in survivors, assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1977</LINK>), was reduced in the early CDP group [MD -1.70 (-3.27, -0.13)]. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1978</LINK>) found no difference in the time spent in FIO2 &gt; 0.3 or &gt; 0.7. The outcomes IVH, NEC, and CLD at 36 weeks were not reported in any of the studies nor was there follow up assessment of physical growth, neurodevelopmental outcome or cerebral palsy in any of the studies. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>) reported no cases of ROP (Outcome 01-11) in either group. In subgroup analysis by type of CDP there was no evidence of effect on pneumothorax.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup Analysis by Birthweight (Outcome 1.8):</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Krouskop-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Krouskop 1975</LINK>) did a subgroup analysis by birthweight using subgroups &lt; 1500 g and 1500 g or more. There were no deaths in either group for infants 1500 g or more. Among infants &lt;1500 g there was no significant effect of early CDP in use of IPPV [typical RR 1.00 (0.45, 2.23)] or mortality [typical RR 1.00 (0.45, 2.23)], but only a very small number of patients were analysed.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity Analysis</B>
<BR/>Excluding the quasi-random study of Krouskop did not change the conclusion that early compared with delayed CDP reduces use of IPPV.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-17 15:12:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review suggest that in preterm infants with RDS, early compared with delayed application of CDP is effective in reducing subsequent use of IPPV. This is clinically important, as IPPV is associated with increased costs and adverse effects.</P>
<P>However, caution is required in interpreting these results as the sample size is small and the studies were all performed in the pre-surfactant era when the use of antenatal steroids was not common. These interventions could reduce baseline risk and hence the effect size that CDP may have on RDS. The mean birth weight and gestation of the treatment groups ranged from 1545 to 2113 g and 31 to 34 weeks, considerably higher than the major group of infants receiving treatment for RDS in current practice. The age at application of early CDP ranged from a mean of 7.1 to 18 hours, later than what would currently be considered early intervention for the treatment of RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Narendran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narendran 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tooley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tooley 2003</LINK>). In addition there was wide variation in the criteria used for initiating early and late CDP and some overlap between the intervention and control groups as well as no blinding of treatment or outcome assessment.</P>
<P>We have included any type of CDP irrespective of the mode of delivery. Included trials used CNP and CPAP delivered by face mask or nasal prongs. In this review the studies using CNP showed a reduction in treatment failure but this was not seen in the studies using CPAP. Airway resistance is increased with CPAP compared with CNP so this difference may be plausible. Indeed recently differences in efficacy between CPAP devices have been described (<LINK REF="REF-De-Paoli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Paoli 2003</LINK>) and direct comparison of CNP with other methods of applying CDP may be warranted.</P>
<P>Pneumothorax occurred in more than 10% of infants in the CDP subgroup. This is higher than would be expected today (<LINK REF="REF-Verder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verder 1999</LINK>). There was no evidence of effect of early CDP on the rate of pneumothorax. The one small study that looked at BPD did not find any effect but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion. The rates of ROP, NEC and post discharge outcomes were not reported in any study.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some evidence that early application of CDP has a clinical benefit in the treatment of RDS in that it reduces subsequent use of IPPV and thus may be useful in preventing the adverse effects of this treatment. </P>
<P>However the applicability of these findings to the current practice of neonatal intensive care is uncertain given that the trials in this review were all conducted in the pre-surfactant era when antenatal steroid usage was uncommon and infants were higher birth weights, gestations and older than those currently treated for RDS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Revaluation of the strategy of early CDP in the era of antenatal steroid and surfactant administration is indicated. However, as CDP is now a standard practice the main thrust for research in this area should be towards establishing the preferred mode, level of pressure and timing of CDP use. These studies should also attempt to answer the question about the preferred timing, dose and mode of administration of surfactant when used in conjunction with CDP.</P>
