<P>There is not enough evidence to say if closing the cut in the womb after caesarean section is better done within the abdomen or outside.</P>
<P>In order to perform a caesarean section, the mother's abdomen and then the uterus need to be cut in order for the baby to be born. These cuts then need to be stitched up (sutured). It has been suggested that it might be easier to bring the uterus outside the abdomen in order to suture it and then return it to its place, rather than suturing it in position. The review of six trials found that there was not enough evidence to say if this was better for the mother or not. More research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-01-12 21:29:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Different techniques have been described to reduce morbidity during caesarean section. After the baby has been born by caesarean section and the placenta has been extracted, temporary removal of the uterus from the abdominal cavity (exteriorisation of the uterus) to facilitate repair of the uterine incision has been postulated as a valuable technique. This is particularly so when exposure of the incision is difficult and when there are problems with haemostasis. Several clinical trials have been done, with varying results, including substantial reduction in the rate of postoperative infection and morbidity with extra-abdominal closure of the uterine incision, and less associated peri-operative haemorrhage. Subsequent studies suggest that the method of placental removal rather than method of closure of the uterine incision influences peri-operative morbidity.<BR/>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2003, Issue 3) and PubMed (1966 to 2003). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 12 January 2011 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials involving a comparison of uterine exteriorisation with intra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision in women undergoing caesarean section.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the trials identified for inclusion. We compared categorical data using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and continuous data using the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. We tested for statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I squared test. Where no significant heterogeneity (greater than 50%) existed, we pooled data using a fixed effect model. If significant heterogeneity existed, a random effects model was used.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies were included, with 1294 women randomised overall, and 1221 women included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in most of the outcomes identified, except for febrile morbidity and length of hospital stay. With extra-abdominal closure of the uterine incision, febrile morbidity was lower (relative risk 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.97), and the hospital stay was longer (weighted mean difference 0.24 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39). <BR/> </P>

<P>There is no evidence from this review to make definitive conclusions about which method of uterine closure offers greater advantages, if any. However, these results are based on too few and too small studies to detect differences in rare, but severe, complications.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-12 21:36:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-12 21:36:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is one of the most frequently performed major surgical procedures worldwide. It accounts for between 1% and 70% of deliveries depending on the facility or country assessed. Rates in the United Kingdom for 2000 were reported as 21% in England and 24% in Wales and in Northern Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). Similar rates have been reported for the United States of America (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 1997</LINK>) and China (<LINK REF="REF-Cai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cai 1998</LINK>). In Latin America, estimates from a survey of selected hospitals ranged from 1.6% in a Haitian hospital to 40% in Chile, and more than 50% in most private hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Paraguay (<LINK REF="REF-Belizan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belizan 1999</LINK>). Rates for West and East African countries ranged from 0.3% in Niger to 10.5% in Kenya (<LINK REF="REF-Beukens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beukens 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Many variations in the technique of caesarean section have been devised, with the purpose of shortening the operating time, making the operation easier and more efficient, reducing costs, decreasing the risk of adverse effects, and shortening postoperative morbidity and duration of hospital stay. While details of operative technique are not more important than the question of whether or not there is a valid indication for the operation, these proposed variations are also important, and must be evaluated by randomised comparisons. </P>
<P>After the baby has been born by caesarean section and the placenta has been extracted, either spontaneously (placenta separates spontaneously from the wall of the uterus) or by manual removal (separation of the placenta from the uterine wall by hand), temporary removal of the uterus from the abdominal cavity (exteriorisation of the uterus) to facilitate repair of the uterine incision has been postulated as a valuable technique. This is particularly so when exposure of the incision is difficult and there may be complications such as tearing of the uterine angle (rupture of part of the uterine wall) or problems with haemostasis (reducing the flow of blood). Many surgeons believe that it is easier to repair the exteriorised uterus, and thus that bleeding may be reduced with this method (<LINK REF="REF-Cosgrove-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosgrove 1958</LINK>). However, opposition to uterine exteriorisation, particularly with epidural or spinal analgesia, arose from concerns about nausea and vomiting with uterine traction, haemodynamic instability (instability of the blood circulatory system), exposure of the fallopian tubes to unnecessary trauma, potential infection, possible rupture of the utero-ovarian veins upon replacing the uterus and pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Carrie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stock-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stock 1985</LINK>). Antibiotics are frequently prescribed, either pre- or postoperatively (peri-operative antibiotics).</P>
<P>The lack of agreement on the site of uterine repair is reflected in variations in practice. In a pilot study in Hull Maternity Hospital, UK, 46% of uterine incisions were repaired with exteriorisation of the uterus, and 54% intraperitoneally (PS Eccersley, personal communication, cited by <LINK REF="STD-Wahab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wahab 1999</LINK>). Although limited work has been done on this subject, there have been a few randomised controlled trials, with varying results. Earlier works showed a substantial reduction in the rate of postoperative infection and morbidity with exteriorisation of the uterus. There was also less associated peri-operative haemorrhage (bleeding during the surgical period) (<LINK REF="STD-Hershey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hershey 1978</LINK>). However, Magann (<LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1995</LINK>) suggested, in a series of studies, that the method of placental removal (i.e. spontaneous versus manual) rather than exteriorisation of the uterus influenced peri-operative haemorrhage and postoperative infection rates. More recent studies have found that although there were no significant differences in haemodynamic parameters, exteriorisation of the uterus was associated with a smaller reduction in postoperative haematocrit values (<LINK REF="STD-Edi_x002d_Osagie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Edi-Osagie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wahab 1999</LINK>). These authors feel that exteriorisation of the uterus at caesarean section is a valid option, as demonstrated by clinical and statistical evidence.</P>
<P>This is one of a series of reviews of individual aspects of caesarean section technique. More detailed background and reference to related reviews is given in the review 'Techniques for caesarean section' (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the experimental group, the surgeon will have been requested to exteriorise the uterus following delivery of the baby and placenta.

<P>In all the trials included, the method of randomisation was clearly explained. In five studies, there were double randomisations of the participants included in both arms of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Hershey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hershey 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wahab 1999</LINK>), with consequent subgrouping of the data. The types of participants, interventions and outcomes were clearly defined, in all the studies. However, allocation concealment in four studies was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Edi_x002d_Osagie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Edi-Osagie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hershey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hershey 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wahab 1999</LINK>).</P>

Protocol violations occurred in three studies involving 92 women in total (<LINK REF="STD-Hershey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hershey 1978</LINK> - 78 (20%); <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993b</LINK> - 12 (10%); <LINK REF="STD-Wahab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wahab 1999</LINK> - 2 (0.01%)), of which 73 women were excluded, by the authors, from the analysis.

Subgroup analysis for manual and spontaneous placental removal were added post-hoc to the review in order to be able to include these data. Data from these subgroups were identified as (M) and (S). Thus the subgroup with manual removal of the placenta and uterine exteriorisation is compared with the subgroup with manual removal of the placenta and in situ repair, etc. Additionally, as there were two studies done in 1993 by the same author, these have been identified as <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993b</LINK>.</P>

<P>Meta-analysis of the results showed that febrile morbidity (symptoms due to a temperature of above 37.5 degrees Celsius on at least two consecutive readings, done at least six hours apart) was less common in the uterine exteriorisation group (relative risk 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.97) in the one study that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hershey-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hershey 1978</LINK>). This finding was statistically significant. In four studies, the length of hospital stay was only marginally longer with uterine exteriorisation (weighted mean difference 0.24 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39), which may not have much clinical significance. With regard to wound complications, the incidence is much higher in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Edi_x002d_Osagie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Edi-Osagie 1998</LINK>), suggesting that the trialists' definition of wound infection may have been different from other authors.</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the other outcomes. For most outcomes, relatively few studies contributed data.</P>
<P>The occurrence of uterine angle tear was documented in only one study, where it occurred in one woman in each group (<LINK REF="STD-Edi_x002d_Osagie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Edi-Osagie 1998</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>So far, few clinical trials have been conducted comparing uterine exteriorisation with intra-abdominal closure of the uterus. The quality of the trials is not high overall, particularly with regard to the large number of exclusions from the analysis. The existing data do not provide clinicians with adequate answers regarding the benefits or risks of either method. Furthermore, these data have been produced over 20 years with very little concordance among the authors about which method of uterine closure is better. Therefore, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about which method of uterine closure offers greater advantages, if any. Additionally, in three of the six trials reviewed, women were randomised to method of placental removal (either spontaneous or manual), and these results analysed within the groups, which makes it difficult to ascertain whether either method is superior. Methods concerning closure of the uterine incision need to be considered with regards to the benefits or harm in order to be able to offer the best available surgical care to women undergoing caesarean section.</P>
<P>This review attempted to bridge the gap that existed regarding the quality and quantity of data available on this topic. We noted that, of the six studies reviewed, three had been conducted by the same author (<LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-_x0028_M_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Magann (M) 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Meta-analysis of various outcomes shows that, apart from febrile morbidity and length of hospital stay, there were overall no statistically significant differences between the groups, despite conflicting evidence in the various trials. There is therefore no clear evidence in favour of either method.</P>
<P>It must be noted that the clinical trials included in this review are relatively small, and most of the outcomes identified could only be assessed with data from a few studies. There is thus a possibility of type 2 statistical error (failure to identify a true difference).</P>
<P>The possibility of rare complications, such as tearing of the ovarian veins, which are unlikely to be reflected in randomised trials, should be borne in mind when interpreting the trial data. This information can be collected using large retrospective non-randomised studies, although interpretation of these results may be problematic.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-01 23:44:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no good evidence from this review to support one intervention above the other when it comes to considering extra-abdominal and intra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision. This may be due to the fact that these results are based on too few and too small studies to detect differences in rare, but serious, complications. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-12-01 23:44:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for further research in this area, as no large randomised controlled clinical trials have been done to assess the benefits and risks of uterine exteriorisation. All the trials that have been done are relatively small and measure few outcomes. Additionally, all of the trials were conducted in high-income countries, where there is access to high care facilities and the risks of caesarean section are small. There are no data available for low resource settings, where there may be restricted access and management options, which would have a direct impact on patient care.</P>
