<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:32:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is sudden loss of hearing where clinical assessment has failed to reveal a cause. Patients may also suffer from additional symptoms such as tinnitus (a background ringing noise), together with dizziness and a sensation of fullness in the ear. Prompt investigation is essential to identify and treat the hearing impairment. In a large proportion of patients, however, no cause can be found.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Antiviral drugs are often used, usually in conjunction with steroids, to treat sudden hearing loss of unknown cause, based on the theory that the deafness is caused by a viral infection. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared treatment of sudden hearing loss with antiviral drugs (either alone or in combination with another treatment) with placebo or no antiviral drug, in patients of any age. We found four RCTs (257 patients). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. All four trials compared steroid treatment (either alone or plus a placebo drug) with steroid plus antiviral treatment. None of the trials found a statistically significant difference between groups. No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to using antiviral treatments. One study reported slight to moderate nausea equally in the acyclovir and placebo groups (one patient in each), both attributable to the steroid treatment. Another reported insomnia, nervousness and weight gain with valacyclovir (number not specified).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of antiviral drugs in the treatment of sudden hearing loss of unknown origin is questionable. Certainly, this review of the clinical trials did not identify any substantial evidence to support their use. Further research is required with larger patient numbers and standardised inclusion criteria, antiviral regimes and outcome measures.</P>

<P>Two authors independently extracted data, met to resolve disagreements and contacted study authors for further information. We assessed study risk of bias independently.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:28:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four randomised trials (257 participants). The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low. Two trials compared the addition of intravenous acyclovir to a steroid (prednisolone). One included 43 participants, the other 70 patients. Neither demonstrated any hearing improvement with ISSHL. Another (84 patients) did not show any statistically significant difference between groups with the addition of valacyclovir to prednisolone (compared to steroid plus placebo) with respect to change in pure-tone audiogram. Comparing the addition of intravenous acyclovir to hydrocortisone with hydrocortisone alone, the final trial did not show any statistically significant difference between groups (60 patients). No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to the use of antiviral treatment. One study reported slight to moderate nausea equally in the acyclovir and placebo groups (one patient in each). Another reported insomnia, nervousness and weight gain with valacyclovir (number not specified). Even though no meta-analysis was possible, evidence from the four RCTs has demonstrated no statistically significant advantage in the use of antivirals in the treatment of ISSHL.</P>

<P>There is currently no evidence to support the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of ISSHL. The four trials included in this review were, however, small and with a low risk of bias. Further randomised controlled trials with larger patient populations, using standardised inclusion criteria, antiviral regimes and outcome measures, are needed in order for adequate meta-analysis to be performed to reach definitive conclusions. A uniform definition of ISSHL should also be established, together with what constitutes adequate recovery.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-05 12:07:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) was first described in 1944 (<LINK REF="REF-DeKleyn-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeKleyn 1944</LINK>) and is characterised by sudden loss of hearing of cochlear or retro-cochlear origin without an identifiable cause. It is considered a medical emergency (<LINK REF="REF-Conlin-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conlin 2007b</LINK>) carrying serious morbidity, affecting the patient's work and overall quality of life, with early treatment associated with a more favourable prognosis (<LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>ISSHL is usually a unilateral condition and affects approximately 5 to 20 per 100,000 individuals every year (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>). The degree of hearing loss experienced varies widely between mild, moderate and severe. A considerable proportion of cases can recover, at least partially, even without treatment. However many are left with some degree of permanent hearing loss, with or without tinnitus (a buzzing, ringing or whistling sensation of sound in one or both ears occurring without an external stimulus). The onset of ISSHL is rapid and early intervention is considered essential to prevent damage to the cochlea.</P>
<P>There are many theories as to the origin of this condition, including blood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Gussen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gussen 1976</LINK>), immune disorders (<LINK REF="REF-McCabe-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCabe 1979</LINK>), perilymphatic fistulas (<LINK REF="REF-Goodhill-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodhill 1971</LINK>) and viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>). Each of these theories is based on certain laboratory and post-mortem findings, but each has its own flaws. Blood disorders, such as polycythaemia, hyperviscosity and sickle cell crisis, can result in cochlear hypoxia and labyrinthine membrane necrosis by changing the viscosity and flow of the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Schuknecht-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuknecht 1986</LINK>). However, experimental and clinical studies do not show enough evidence of fibrosis (the development of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ, replacing normal tissue) or new bone formation, which would have been supportive of this theory. The eventual presence of antibodies against the inner ear suggests that sudden hearing loss pathogenesis may be autoimmune in nature, but the difficulty in establishing a correlation between the clinical aspects of the hearing loss and the antibody level also does not help this theory (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarini-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarini 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>In one study, a perilymphatic fistula was discovered in three patients with sudden hearing loss (<LINK REF="REF-Goodhill-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodhill 1980</LINK>), thus establishing round and oval window breaks as accepted aetiologies for sudden hearing loss. However, intra-cochlear membrane breaks, with or without round or oval window involvement, have been poorly supported clinically and histopathologically as a cause for ISSHL. Another study demonstrated no active or healed membrane breaks in 12 dissected temporal bones (<LINK REF="REF-Schuknecht-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuknecht 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, viruses can cause sudden hearing loss either as an acute infection or as delayed onset with the latent form of the virus being possibly reactivated. Viruses implicated include herpes zoster oticus (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>) and herpes simplex type 1 (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>). This theory has also been supported by the isolation of viral particles from human cochlea (<LINK REF="REF-Tucci-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucci 2000</LINK>) and by the fact that ganciclovir (an antiviral) has a beneficial effect in preventing hearing deterioration when given to symptomatically infected infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lackner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lackner 2009</LINK>). When tested on experimental herpes simplex labyrinthitis (<LINK REF="REF-Stokroos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokroos 1999</LINK>), a combination treatment consisting of prednisolone and acyclovir resulted in earlier hearing recovery and less extensive cochlear destruction compared to prednisolone or acyclovir monotherapy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Several treatment protocols for ISSHL exist including steroids, hyperbaric oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2005</LINK>), vasoactive substances (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2009</LINK>) and antiviral agents either alone or in combination (<LINK REF="REF-Jeyakumar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeyakumar 2006</LINK>). Prior to treatment a thorough history is taken and a complete ear, nose and throat examination is performed. A series of investigations help to rule out any identifiable causes of hearing loss, such as a middle ear effusion or other conductive aetiology. Blood tests, including syphilis serology and even a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to rule out intracranial causes are often carried out. The pure-tone audiogram (PTA) is the mainstay of the diagnosis and, although the hearing impairment varies in sound frequency and intensity, should show a unilateral hearing loss of 30 dB or more affecting in at least three contiguous frequencies (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1980</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Antivirals such as acyclovir and ganciclovir are commonly prescribed to treat this condition and many patients are admitted to hospital whilst receiving this treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Conlin-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conlin 2007b</LINK>). However, there is no consensus amongst otolaryngologists either on the treatment regimen or its effectiveness in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenman 2000</LINK>). Antivirals are often prescribed alongside steroids such as prednisolone or hydrocortisone, whilst the patient is observed closely and hearing tests are repeated regularly. A recent Cochrane review found the value of steroids in the treatment of this condition to be unclear after identifying two randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK>) and case series that have looked at the role of antivirals in the treatment of ISSHL are in conflict. Some studies have found encouraging results, especially when looking at steroid-antiviral combinations and early combination therapy. However, because this is a relatively uncommon condition and the treatments vary (as well as the outcome measures used), these results do not provide strong evidence when looked at separately. A Cochrane systematic review of the evidence is therefore warranted.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> divided patients equally into two groups. Both groups were admitted for one week for intravenous administration of prednisolone at a dosage of 1 mg/kg bodyweight on day one and then reduced in equal increments over six days to 0 mg. In addition to this, one group received a dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight of acyclovir three times daily intravenously for seven days. The second group received a placebo in similar concentration and frequency. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> patients were randomised equally two treatment arms; one received systemic steroids plus valacyclovir, the other received systemic steroid plus placebo. The steroid part of treatment consisted of a 12-day course of prednisolone at a dose of 80 mg/day for four days and then tapered over eight days. The valacyclovir dose was 1 g administered three times daily for 10 days, replaced by placebo in the control group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> the intervention was in the form of intravenous acyclovir 15 mg/kg/day and hydrocortisone 100 mg three times a day for seven days for the intervention group consisting of 29 patients, with the control group of 31 patients receiving intravenous hydrocortisone only, at the same dose, for seven days. This was followed by a further seven days of prednisolone on a tapering regimen.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> divided patients into two groups. Both groups were treated for one week with intravenous administration of prednisolone at a dosage of 1 mg/kg bodyweight on day one and then reduced in equal increments over the course of seven days to 0 mg. One group of 46 patients received a dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight of acyclovir three times daily intravenously for seven days; the second group of 45 patients received a placebo in similar concentration and frequency. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome measures in <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> included (i) subjective parameters with patients being asked to judge their hearing recovery, pressure sensation and dizziness, (ii) virus serological investigations using specific IgG and IgM detection and (iii) quantitative parameters including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, brain stem-evoked response audiometry and nystagmography. All patients were reviewed and all outcome measures were assessed at one week and then three, six and 12 months after treatment. </P>
<P>The primary outcome measure in <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> was a change in pure-tone audiogram hearing threshold, assessed at presentation, then at two and six weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures included (i) speech discrimination scores, (ii) Short Form-12 questionnaire at presentation and week two and (iii) Hearing Screening Inventory questionnaire twice-weekly for six weeks. </P>
<P>The main outcome measure in <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> was an improvement in the involved pure-tone frequency average, or in speech reception threshold, with more than 15 dB being considered significant. Audiometry (including pure-tone, speech reception threshold, discrimination, stapedial reflex, tympanometry and tone decay) was performed before admission and at one, three and 12 months post-treatment. </P>
<P>The main outcome measures in <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> included (i) patients being subjectively asked to judge their hearing recovery, pressure sensation and vertigo, (ii) quantitative parameters including pure-tone audiometry and speech audiometry and (iii) virus serological investigations using specific IgG and IgM detection.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Improvement in pure-tone thresholds and/or speech discrimination</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> observed a hearing recovery of more than 10 dB in 34/43 patients (79%) by 12 months. This was achieved immediately after finishing treatment in 18/43 (42%) and within two weeks by 28/43 (65%). Specific patient numbers for each group were not expressed, instead being summarised as percentages. The authors concluded that the addition of acyclovir to prednisone did not impart any statistically significant difference in hearing improvement in their 43 patients with ISSHL. </P>
<P>In 84 patients, <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between groups with the addition of valacyclovir to prednisone in respect to change in pure-tone audiogram. Seventeen of 39 patients given valacyclovir and 15 of 29 given placebo recovered excellent hearing (defined as within 10 to 20 dB of the unaffected ear) - about 45% of the patient total. Twenty-one of 39 valacyclovir-treated patients and 19 of 29 placebo-treated patients recovered at least 50% of their hearing loss - around 59% of the total study population.</P>
<P>Comparing the addition of acyclovir to hydrocortisone, <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> did not show any statistically significant difference between groups in 60 patients. Overall improvement, considered significant if over 15 dB in the involved frequency, was seen in 78% through both groups - 78.6% of those given acyclovir and 77.4% given hydrocortisone alone.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> was unable to show any statistically significant difference between groups when comparing the addition of acyclovir to prednisolone in their study of 70 patients. In fact, the placebo group at one year showed a greater recovery than the acyclovir group but this was not statistically significant. Specific numbers for each group were not stated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcome measures summary</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcome measures varied between papers and were mainly subjective, including the effect on tinnitus, vertigo, pressure sensation and hearing screening questionnaires. However, none were consistent across all papers, making collective analysis of effect of intervention impossible.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tinnitus</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of tinnitus quoted by all papers was between 73% and 87%. In <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> the authors stated no statistical difference in tinnitus complaints between both groups (acyclovir versus placebo), with acyclovir having no influence over tinnitus prognosis, itself showing a poor prognosis being still present in 46% to 55% of patients after 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> observed a reduction in tinnitus in both groups irrespective of treatment given (valacyclovir or placebo). <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> did not state any direct influence of treatment on tinnitus progression but observed hearing improvement was significantly better if tinnitus was present.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pressure sensation</HEADING>
<P>Present in 35% to 49% of patients either preceding, accompanying or after the hearing loss, <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> stated that this symptom held a favourable prognosis, reducing to around 15% of patients complaining of this symptom after 12 months. Neither acyclovir or placebo had any statistically significant influence on the sensation of pressure. This symptom was not investigated by <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dizziness/vertigo</HEADING>
<P>Observed in 30% to 47%, vestibular complaints held a good prognosis and resolved quickly in the majority of patients, being present in only 10% after one year. However, none of the authors could demonstrate any difference in vertiginous symptoms between either treatment group, either at presentation or after treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> observed that hearing recovery was poorer if dizziness was present.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> slight to moderate nausea occurred once in the placebo group and once in the acyclovir group. In the placebo group, one patient complained of stomach pain and one patient developed a reversible high blood glucose level. These two side effects were both interpreted to be the result of prednisolone administration. No specific acyclovir side effects were observed. In <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> no side effects of acyclovir were observed. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> reported slightly raised blood glucose level, mild headache, heart palpitations and mild nausea. These side effects were interpreted to be the result of steroid therapy. No specific side effects of acyclovir were observed. <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> reported no major side effects apart from insomnia, nervousness and weight gain, which were higher in the valacyclovir group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential success of antiviral therapy in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is based on the theory that viral infection is involved in the aetiology of this condition. The effectiveness of antivirals in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains unproven.</P>
<P>We employed a comprehensive search strategy to identify as many studies of the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss as possible and to avoid the potential for selection bias. We then applied strict inclusion criteria to retain only studies that were less likely to be biased. There were only four randomised controlled trials addressing the effectiveness of antivirals in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. A consistent limitation of all these studies was the small number of patients included in the trials.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though no meta-analysis was possible, as discussed above, the evidence from all four randomised controlled trials demonstrates no statistically significant advantage in the use of antivirals in the treatment of ISSHL.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> the authors demonstrated no statistical evidence supporting the beneficial effect of combining acyclovir with prednisolone in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> was unable to demonstrate any significant difference between placebo and valacyclovir treatment groups regarding hearing or symptom recovery on the basis of the Short Form-12 or the Hearing Screening Inventory questionnaires. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> no significant difference was found between the group receiving intravenous acyclovir with hydrocortisone and the group receiving hydrocortisone alone in terms of audiometric improvement. Their data suggested that the sooner treatment is started, the better the chance of recovery, irrespective of treatment given, though this was not statistically demonstrated.</P>
<P>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> concluded that circumstantial evidence still points to a viral infection as an aetiological factor, however they demonstrated no statistical evidence supporting the beneficial effect of combining acyclovir with prednisolone in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. </P>
<P>With regard to secondary outcome measures, none of the authors were able to demonstrate any favourable influence of antivirals on the prognosis of tinnitus, pressure sensation or vertigo.</P>
<P>The available evidence does not show that antiviral agents alone are effective as first-line treatment for ISSHL. The addition of antiviral to steroid therapy has not been demonstrated to show any obvious statistically significant improvement in outcome following ISSHL. No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to using antiviral treatments.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:28:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified four randomised trials out of which three were of good quality with a low risk of bias. The trials had relatively small numbers of participants and somewhat variable treatment protocols. None of the trials included showed significant benefit from adding antivirals to the treatment of ISSHL. It is doubtful that a larger trial with a similar treatment protocol will show a considerable value of using antivirals for treating ISSHL, but if such a trial is to be carried out it would be extremely important to choose a clear hearing loss inclusion threshold together with a reproducible, well-defined outcome measure based on previous studies. It is only then, with a large number of participants, that a subtle effect maybe identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-05 12:00:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All authors mention circumstantial evidence in the published literature pointing towards a viral cause. However, there is currently no evidence to support the use of antiviral drugs in addition to steroids in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). The four trials included in this review were, however, small and with a low risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Stokroos-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stokroos 1998</LINK> mentioned a previously observed synergistic effect of acyclovir and prednisolone on hearing recovery and cochlear histopathology in experimental herpes viral labyrinthitis in the guinea pig. Given that the experimental situation eliminated any treatment delay, the authors suggested that treatment of ISSHL might be divided into two phases with the possible benefit of combined therapy being helpful in the first, very early, phase. However, since patients with this condition tend to present later, these results would be extremely difficult to reproduce in clinical practice. <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> supported this viewpoint, stating that the viral damage to the ear could be complete by time of presentation, and <LINK REF="STD-Uri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uri 2003</LINK> observed better hearing recovery with earlier treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Tucci-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tucci 2002</LINK> noted that male sex, absence of vertigo and a milder hearing loss at presentation were predictors of a better prognosis. <LINK REF="STD-Westerlaken-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Westerlaken 2003</LINK> suggested 'pulse therapy' with high-dose glucocorticoid might enhance hearing recovery by suppression of the immune system but found no additive benefit of antivirals. No trial documented any serious adverse effects related to using antiviral treatments.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-20 23:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials with larger patient populations, using a standardised inclusion criteria, antivirals and outcome measures, are needed in order for adequate meta-analysis to be performed to reach definitive conclusions. A uniform definition of ISSHL should also be established, together with what constitutes adequate recovery.</P>
