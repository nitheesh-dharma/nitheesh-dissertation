<P>Not enough evidence to support use of biophysical profile (BPP) for the assessment of fetal well-being in high-risk pregnancies.</P>
<P>Monitoring the baby's well-being in the uterus in pregnancy is often undertaken using a cardiotocograph (CTG) machine. A CTG assesses the pattern of the baby's heartbeats alongside the size of the mother's contractions. However, this is not a very accurate test on its own. So monitoring the baby's movements has also been suggested as a useful addition to predict babies in difficulty. This is because a reduction in fetal movement sometimes precedes a baby's death. It is thought that if the oxygen supply to the baby through the afterbirth (placenta) is insufficient, the baby responds by moving less often. As fetal movement patterns may vary considerably, multiple fetal activities might be a better predictor of poor outcome. Consequently, the biophysical profile (BPP) and modified biophysical profile (MBPP) have been introduced. The BPP uses ultrasound to assess 1) fetal movement, 2) tone, 3) breathing and 4) the amniotic fluid volume that surrounds the baby. In addition, the baby's heartbeat is monitored over a 20-minute period using a CTG machine. This produces a paper tracing of the baby's heart rate, the mother's contractions and when the baby moves. Sometimes a modified BPP is used first (MBPP), involving the CTG trace and the amniotic fluid volume only. If this indicates a possible abnormality, then the full BPP is used. This review of trials compared the BPP (or MBPP) with conventional monitoring (CTG only) on pregnancy outcome in high-risk pregnancies. Five trials involving 2974 women with pregnancies with a high risk of poorer fetal outcome were found. There was no difference between the groups in the number of babies that died, nor in the number of babies who had low Apgar scores. However, although the number of women involved was small, the BPP was associated with a significant increase in induction and caesarean section. However, the data are insufficient to reach a conclusion about the benefit or otherwise of the BPP as a test of fetal wellbeing.</P>

<P>We included five trials, involving 2974 women. Most trials were not of high quality. Although the overall incidence of adverse outcomes was low, available evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support the use of BPP as a test of fetal wellbeing in high-risk pregnancies. We found no significant differences between the groups in perinatal deaths (relative risk (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 2.98) or in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.92).Combined data from the two high-quality trials suggest an increased risk of caesarean section in the BPP group RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.44, n = 280, interaction test P = 0.03. However, the number of participating women was relatively small (n = 280). Therefore, additional evidence is required in order to be definitive regarding the efficacy of this test in high-risk pregnancies. Furthermore, the impact of the BPP on other interventions, length of hospitalisation, serious short-term and long-term neonatal morbidity and parental satisfaction requires further evaluation. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-02-11 10:30:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetal movement is one of the first signs of fetal life and is regarded as a manifestation of fetal wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Marsal-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsal 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayburn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayburn 1990</LINK>). Pregnant women frequently become aware of fetal activity from 18 to 20 weeks' gestation and maternal perceptions of a reduction or cessation of fetal movements is reported frequently by pregnant women as a cause for concern. The observation that decreased fetal activity preceded fetal death (<LINK REF="REF-Sadovsky-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadovsky 1973</LINK>) stimulated investigations into the value of the monitoring of fetal movements as a mechanism to predict fetal wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rayburn-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayburn 1982</LINK>). It has been suggested that in the presence of a persistently (chronic) inadequate oxygen supply (hypoxia), the fetus attempts to reduce the level of oxygen consumption (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1989</LINK>) through reducing fetal activity. Consequently, maternal counting of fetal movements was proposed as a useful strategy to monitor the fetal condition, with a view to reducing the rate of intrauterine deaths from hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>). Whilst several studies have demonstrated that diminishing or cessation of fetal activity may result in poor pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Leader-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leader 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valentin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentin 1986</LINK>), others have reported the converse (<LINK REF="REF-Harrington-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrington 1998</LINK>), arguing that reduced fetal movements may indicate that fetal wellbeing is already compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Valentin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentin 1987</LINK>). In the absence of conclusive evidence that counting fetal movements reduces the antepartum fetal death rate, alternative methods of fetal assessment such as the biophysical profile (BPP) and the cardiotocograph (CTG) have been introduced.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methods of antenatal assessment of fetal health</HEADING>
<P>Many efforts have been made to develop non-invasive forms of antenatal assessment of fetal wellbeing. As fetal sleeping periods can lead to falsely non-reactive CTG patterns, vibration and sound stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-East-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2005</LINK>) and manual fetal manipulation (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2001</LINK>) have been used in conjunction with fetal heart rate monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Pattison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattison 1999</LINK>). Such stimuli are intended to provoke fetal movement and a concurrent acceleration in the fetal heart rate, which is an indicator of fetal wellbeing. The concept of simultaneous evaluation of multiple fetal activities using real time ultrasonography led to the introduction of the BPP in the early 1980s. The BPP is a form of fetal assessment that combines the measurement of five biophysical variables as a means of assessing overall fetal wellbeing. The BPP, like other methods of antepartum fetal assessment, is usually started at a gestational age when extra-uterine survival or active intervention for fetal compromise is considered feasible (from 24 weeks).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The intervention - BPP</HEADING>
<P>The BPP combines the assessment of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (CTG) with four biophysical features, namely (i) fetal movements, (ii) fetal tone, (iii) fetal breathing and (iv) estimation of amniotic fluid volume. These latter four variables are observed using real-time ultrasonography. The fetal heart rate is recorded, usually over a 20-minute period, and is achieved by using a Doppler ultrasound transducer to monitor the fetal heart through the mother's abdomen. Uterine contractions are monitored simultaneously by a pressure transducer on the mother's abdomen. Both transducers are linked to a monitor and this results in a paper trace known as a CTG. In the original BPP proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Manning-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 1980</LINK>, two points are awarded for each of the following parameters when present, and zero when absent (there is no intermediate score of one): (i) gross body movements - two or more discrete body/limb movements within 30 minutes; (ii) fetal tone - one or more episode of active extension with return to flexion of fetal limb(s) or trunk (opening and closing of hands are considered normal tone); (iii) fetal breathing movement - at least one episode of fetal breathing lasting more than 20 seconds within 30 minutes; (iv) amniotic fluid volume - one or more pockets of amniotic fluid measuring more than 2 cm in the vertical axis. These pockets must be free of umbilical cord or fetal small parts (the measurement of the single deepest pool (SDP) is recorded in order to calculate the overall BPP score) and (v) fetal heart rate reactivity, i.e. two or more episodes of fetal heart rate acceleration of more than 15 beats per minute and of more than 15 seconds duration within 20 minutes. Equal weight is given to each of the five parameters. A maximum score of 10 can be achieved and the test is complete once all of the variables have been observed. For the test to be judged abnormal and a score of zero awarded for the absence of fetal movement, fetal tone or fetal breathing movements, a period of not less than 30 minutes must have elapsed. When each of the four ultrasound variables are normal, the CTG may be excluded as it adds little to the predictive accuracy of the BPP, as a BPP score of 8/8 is reassuring (<LINK REF="REF-Manning-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 1995</LINK>). However, if one or more of the four ultrasound variables are abnormal, the antenatal CTG should be performed. Observational data have shown that at a cut off score &lt; or = 4, the sensitivity of the scoring system (i.e. the ability of the test to correctly identify those babies who are truly not compromised) was 12.5% and specificity 99.23%. At a score of &lt; or = 8, sensitivity and specificity were 70.83% and 91.53%. When compared to each individual assessment variable, the positive predictive value for abnormal perinatal outcome improved when all variables were combined (<LINK REF="REF-Begum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begum 1996</LINK>) .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The modified BPP (CTG and ultrasonic assessment of amniotic fluid)</HEADING>
<P>The BPP is relatively time consuming to perform and consequently several groups (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1994</LINK>) have made minor amendments to the BPP as originally conceived, including variations in the method of estimating amniotic fluid. A shortened version of the BPP, known as the modified biophysical profile (MBPP), consists of: (i) recording an antenatal CTG (with or without vibroacoustic stimulation) combined with (ii) ultrasound measurement of the amniotic fluid. The MBPP is employed as a first-line screening test (<LINK REF="REF-Archibong-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archibong 1999</LINK>) and should be followed by the complete BPP as a back-up test when indicated. The amniotic fluid can be assessed using one of two techniques: (i) measurement of the SDP or (ii) measurement of the Amniotic fluid index (AFI). AFI assessment is performed according to the technique described by <LINK REF="REF-Phelan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 1987</LINK>, whereby the pregnant uterus is divided into four quadrants and the deepest pocket of amniotic fluid in each quadrant is obtained. The AFI is the sum of these four measurements.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conventional monitoring - usually CTG only</HEADING>
<P>The antenatal CTG assesses fetal heart rate pattern in response to fetal movement. In the past, the term non-stress test has been used synonymously with antenatal CTG monitoring in order to highlight the absence of uterine activity or contractions. However, when used in isolation from other methods of assessment of fetal wellbeing, the antenatal CTG is associated with high false-negative and high false-positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Evertson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evertson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schifrin-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schifrin 1979</LINK>). Therefore, it was suggested that the combination of multiple biophysical variables would reduce both the false-negative and the high false-positive results associated with measuring a single variable only (<LINK REF="REF-Manning-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vintzileos-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vintzileos 1983</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physiological basis of the ultrasound parameters of the BPP </HEADING>
<P>The physiological and pathological basis of the BPP is the observed association between hypoxia (low levels of oxygen) and alterations of measures of central nervous system performance such as fetal heart rate patterns, fetal movement and fetal tone, which have been observed in both human and animal fetuses (<LINK REF="REF-Manning-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Natale-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natale 1979</LINK>). Hypoxaemia (reduced blood oxygen levels) results in the redistribution of regional blood flow, leading to a reduction in fetal renal blood and fetal oliguria (reduced urine production) and, thus, less amniotic fluid. However, it is known that factors other than hypoxaemia may affect BPP parameters. These include gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Baskett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskett 1988</LINK>), administration of steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Deren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deren 2001</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Carlan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peaceman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peaceman 1989</LINK>) and excessive transducer pressure on maternal abdomen (<LINK REF="REF-Flack-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flack 1994</LINK>). As a result, concerns have been raised regarding the limitations of individual tests, i.e. CTG or BPP only for the assessment of fetal wellbeing. Consequently, other tests such as doppler velocimetry (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1996</LINK>) have also been proposed, in addition to or instead of the BPP. Although observational studies have suggested that the BPP confers benefits for those tested by a reduction in the fetal death rate (<LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK>), given the considerable financial and manpower costs involved in performing the BPP and potential for harm by increasing the risk of obstetric interventions (labour induction, caesarean section) that may conceivably lead to prematurity and maternal complications, it is important to examine if the BPP confers benefit or harm for the individual woman carrying a high-risk pregnancy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indication for additional methods of assessment of fetal health</HEADING>
<P>Although the majority of pregnancies proceed without complication and culminate in the birth of a healthy baby to a well mother, some pregnancies are more complex. High-risk pregnancy is one in which a particular condition places the mother, the developing fetus, or both at higher-than-normal risk for complications. These may occur antenatally, in labour or postnatally. Factors can be divided into maternal and fetal causes such as high blood pressure in the mother or growth restriction in the fetus. For example, growth restriction secondary to placental insufficiency is a significant cause of perinatal mortality (stillbirth or neonatal death) and morbidity (complications of prematurity) internationally. High-risk pregnancies require additional monitoring. However the outcome varies, depending on the particular condition and its severity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study identification</HEADING>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised trials involving a comparison of biophysical profile with a) no fetal monitoring and b) any other form of antenatal fetal monitoring. A full text copy of each potentially eligible trial identified by the search strategy was independently assessed for inclusion by Joan Lalor (JGL) and Bukola Fawole (BF). There were no disagreements regarding eligibility for inclusion that needed to be resolved by discussion with Declan Devane. We did encounter problems with missing information, resulting in two studies being classified as 'Study awaiting assessment'. We attempted to contact the authors, but were unsuccessful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (JGL and BF) independently assessed the quality of all included trials, namely selection and attrition bias. With regard to performance bias, due to the modus operandi of the biophysical profile (BPP) when compared with antenatal cardiotocograph (CTG) and other forms of assessment of fetal wellbeing, it is unlikely that clinicians or women will have been blinded to the intervention. Therefore, lack of blinding was not considered to undermine the validity of the studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>We allocated studies a grade on the basis of allocation concealment as per criteria outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, i.e. (A) adequate, (B) unclear for trials where randomisation is not clearly described or prone to bias (e.g. open card, coin toss), (C) for quasi-randomised designs such as alternate allocation and use of record numbers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>Due to inadequacies in reporting how losses of participants (e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations) were handled, the review authors were cautious about implicit accounts of follow up. Given that study reports on attrition after allocation have not been found to be consistently related to bias, we did not exclude studies on the basis of attrition. Studies were, however, graded for completeness of follow up using the following criteria. For completeness of follow up:<BR/>(A) less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(D) more than 20% of participants excluded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (JGL and BF) independently extracted the data using data extraction forms designed specifically for the review, the fields of which had been agreed by all review authors. We extracted data by allocated intervention, irrespective of compliance with allocated intervention, in order to allow an 'intention-to-treat' analysis. Women who were randomised, and then either excluded or lost to follow up, were assumed to have no event in the main analysis, and denominators were altered to reflect when this occurred. Study eligibility was re-confirmed at the time of data extraction. Two review authors (JGL and BF) independently entered data onto the Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) computer programme, independently checked them for accuracy and analysed them using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We performed statistical analysis with <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>. We reported dichotomous (or binary) outcomes using the 'relative risk' summary statistic and their 95% confidence intervals. We reported continuous data using the standard mean differences (due to non-normal distribution) and their 95% confidence intervals. We used a fixed-effect model of meta-analysis for summarising the results of studies in the absence of substantial heterogeneity between trials (measured using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic). The statistic is more robust than the Chi-squared test, as it is less affected by the number of trials in the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 30% to 50% suggest mild heterogeneity and more than 50% implies substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis </HEADING>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis based on quality, comparing high-quality trials (allocation concealment and attrition classified as 'A' (adequate, less than 3%)) with trials of lower quality for two outcomes: caesarean section and Apgar score, as data were available in a usable format for these outcomes from each trial.</P>

Five trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (s<I>ee</I> 'Characteristics of included studies' table). Four studies, with 2829 participating women, compared biophysical profile (BPP) with cardiotocograph (CTG) (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manning-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Manning 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>), with 145 participating women, compared complex BPP (a modified biophysical profile (MBPP) comprising computerised CTG, AFI and assessment of fetal breathing, tone and gross body movements) with CTG and amniotic fluid assessment using SDP technique.

<P>Five trials met our inclusion criteria. Two trials included in the review ran the risk of biased allocation through the use of coin flip (<LINK REF="STD-Manning-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Manning 1984</LINK>) or unblinded alternate allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK>). There was a significant and unexplained imbalance in the numbers of randomised participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK> trial (279 in the experimental group compared with 373 in the control group). For one trial, it is unclear as to whether there was adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>An 'intention-to-treat analysis' was used in four of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manning-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Manning 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1994</LINK>). The original report by <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK> included only women who delivered within seven days of a test (76% in the experimental group and 74% in the control group).

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK> trial, women were randomly allocated to receive a daily biophysical profile (BPP) or a daily cardiotocograph (CTG). The last test score obtained before the mother gave birth was used in evaluating the effectiveness of the BPP and the CTG for predicting infectious complications for the mother or fetus. However, abnormal results in the CTG group led to further evaluation with a biophysical profile. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Manning-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Manning 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK>), the BPP was performed on all women, but where a woman had been allocated to the control group, then CTG results alone were disclosed to clinicians. There was no attempt to conceal allocation from participants after randomisation in the <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK> trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Biophysical profile (BPP) versus conventional monitoring</HEADING>
<P>Five randomised trials have been included in this review with 2974 participating women. When the biophysical profile (BPP) is compared with conventional fetal monitoring (cardiotocograph (CTG) or modified biophysical profile (amniotic fluid assessment and CTG), we found no significant differences between the groups in perinatal deaths in infants (including those with congential malformations) (relative risk (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 2.98, n = 2839, four trials), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.92, n = 2974, five trials) and overall incidence of caesarean section (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.54, n = 2239, four trials).</P>
<P>The following <I>a priori </I>defined outcomes were reported in individual trials and consequently, comparable data were not available for meta-analysis; however, we found no differences between the groups for incidence of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15, n = 145, P = 0.30), presence of meconium at birth (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.64, n = 145, P = 0.23) (<LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>) and birthweight less than 10th centile (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56, n = 652, P = 0.39) (<LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were significant differences between the groups (favouring conventional monitoring) in length of stay for the neonate in the NICU (SMD 0.20 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30, n = 1442, two trials). However, the data are skewed due to the length of stay associated with prematurity in the <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK> trial and are therefore unreliable. Women in the BPP group were also more likely to have labour induced (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.03, n = 145, one trial, P = 0.03), in particular for an abnormal BPP test result (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.78, n =145, P = 0.003). The <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK> trial (n = 135) found that neither the BPP nor daily CTG demonstrated good sensitivity for predicting infectious complications following preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.</P>
<P>No reported data were available for analysis for the following outcomes: acidemia, transient tachypnoea of the newborn, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, multi-organ compromise, cognitive impairment or disability, incidence of antenatal admissions, incidence of fetal blood sampling, and length of postnatal hospital stay.</P>

However, it would appear that the risk of having a caesarean section was influenced by the quality of the trials (outcome 02.02). In the two high-quality trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK>) the caesarean section rate in the BPP group was higher than women who had a CTG or CTG and MBPP (RR) 1.60, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.44, n = 280, interaction test P = 0.03.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The main reason for the introduction of the biophysical profile (BPP) into clinical practice was the belief that it would identify fetuses at increased risk of poor outcomes in pregnancies with identified obstetric risk factors. Available evidence from the randomised trials included here does not support the use of BPP as a test of fetal wellbeing in high-risk pregnancies. However, the findings should be considered, taking cognisance of the fact that the total number of women included in this meta-analysis remains small at 2974, and some of the studies carry a high risk of bias (large imbalance in the numbers of women in each group in the <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1985</LINK> trial, randomisation using a coin flip in <LINK REF="STD-Manning-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Manning 1984</LINK> trial). The overall incidence of adverse outcomes was low (perinatal deaths = 0.81%, Apgar score at or below seven at five minutes = 2.9%); thus additional evidence is required to support the value of the test in high-risk pregnancies. In order to derive any meaningful conclusions about the impact of the BPP on perinatal mortality, in excess of 10,000 women would need to be studied. It is also important to note that, although the BPP is used in clinical practice to assess fetal wellbeing at premature gestations, most trials, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK> (n = 135), included participants with pregnancies of 36 weeks' gestation or more. Furthermore, the impact of the BPP at premature gestations, on intervention rates, length of hospitalisation, serious short-term and long-term neonatal morbidity and parental satisfaction requires further evaluation. </P>
<P>The increase in the rate of induction of labour observed in the small trial by Alfirevic and Walkinshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>) highlights the need for careful evaluation of the impact of different fetal monitoring policies on a much wider range of relevant outcomes. The observed increase in this outcome in this study was thought by the authors to be caused by the difference in the type of test used to assess amniotic fluid volume in two groups (amniotic fluid index in the BPP group (experimental) and maximum pool depth in the MBPP group (control)) rather than by the BPP itself. The amniotic fluid index was more frequently abnormal than maximum pool depth leading to increased intervention in the BPP group. </P>
<P>It is regrettable that since the introduction of the BPP in the 1980s, and following reports of observational studies of tens of thousands of pregnancies, less than 3000 women have been enrolled into randomised trials. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-20 14:41:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the biophysical profile (BPP) as a test of fetal wellbeing in high-risk pregnancies. Although the number of participating women was relatively small (n = 280), combined data from the two high-quality trials <LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1999</LINK> suggest an increase in the risk of caesarean section in the BPP group. In addition, the increase in the rate of induction of labour in the <LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK> trial highlights the need for careful evaluation of the impact of the BPP on a wide range of relevant maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, additional data are required to reach any definite conclusion about the benefit or otherwise of the BPP in high-risk pregnancies, as the total number of women included in this meta-analysis remains small at 2964. Consequently, careful evaluation of the impact of the BPP on intervention rates, in premature gestations, on serious short-term and long-term neonatal morbidity is required.</P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The implications for future research are considerable. Further randomised trials of the BPP in pregnancy are long overdue. Researchers are urged to evaluate and report outcomes on interventions, length of hospitalisation, serious neonatal morbidity and parents' satisfaction. In view of an increase in induction of labour associated with a variation in the method of estimating amniotic fluid volume in the <LINK REF="STD-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alfirevic 1995</LINK> trial, a systematic review of the effectiveness of the various methods of assessing amniotic fluid volume is recommended. This should also include the impact that measurement technique has on obstetric interventions, such as caesarean section and induction of labour, and on infant outcomes such as Apgar score, acidosis and admission to NICU. <BR/>
