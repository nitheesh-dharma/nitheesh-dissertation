<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Cysteine, cystine or N-acetylcysteine supplementation in parenterally fed neonates</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sick or preterm newborn infants may require intravenous nutrition, including intravenous administration of solutions containing amino acids. Newborn infants need cysteine (an amino acid) for growth under certain conditions. Cysteine may decrease the chance of liver disease and brittle bones. This systemic review was done to analyze whether adding cysteine (or related compounds) to intravenous nutrition affects growth and other outcomes in newborn infants. Five trials studied the effects of adding cysteine to intravenous nutrition that did not contain cysteine. Addition of cysteine significantly improved the babies' ability to build body proteins (analyzed in four studies); however, it did not improve growth (analyzed in one study); no other outcomes were available. One large randomized trial studied the effect of adding another chemical, N-acetyl-cysteine, to intravenous nutrition that already contained cysteine. This study showed no benefit and no toxicity of this intervention. We conclude that present data are insufficient to justify routine addition of cysteine to the intravenous nutrition of newborn infants that does not contain cysteine. Available evidence does not support routine addition of N-acetylcysteine to intravenous nutrition of newborn infants containing cysteine.</P>

<P>Cysteine is a precursor of glutathione, an antioxidant that may reduce oxidation injury. The addition of cysteine to parenteral nutrition (PN) allows for the reduction of the amount of methionine in PN, thereby limiting hepatotoxicity and acidifies the solution, thereby increasing calcium and phosphate solubility and potentially improving bone mineralization.<BR/>

<P>The standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>) and recent abstracts from the Society for Pediatric Research/ American Pediatric Society, Eastern Society for Pediatric Research, and Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition were originally searched in 2005.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:41:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomized (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials that examined the effects of cysteine, cystine or N-acetylcysteine supplementation of neonatal PN were reviewed.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. Statistical analysis included relative risk, risk difference, and weighted mean difference (WMD). </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:46:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials fulfilled entry criteria. The majority of patients in these trials were preterm. Five small trials evaluated short-term cysteine supplementation of cysteine-free PN. One large multicenter RCT evaluated short-term N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants (&#8804; 1000 grams).</P>
<P>Growth was not significantly affected by cysteine supplementation (1 trial) or by N-acetylcysteine supplementation (1 trial). Nitrogen retention was significantly increased by cysteine supplementation (4 trials) (WMD 31.8 mg/kg/day, 95% confidence interval +8.2, +55.4, n = 95, including 73 preterm infants).</P>
<P>Plasma levels of cysteine were significantly increased by cysteine supplementation but not by N-acetylcysteine supplementation. N-acetylcysteine supplementation did not significantly affect the risks of death by 36 postmenstrual weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), death or BPD, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), severe ROP, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), or severe IVH.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:47:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available evidence from RCTs shows that routine short-term cysteine chloride supplementation of cysteine-free PN in preterm infants improves nitrogen balance. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the risks of cysteine supplementation, especially regarding metabolic acidosis, which has been reported during the first two weeks of cysteine chloride administration. Available evidence from a large RCT trial does not support routine N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:59:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:55:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The inability of sick term and preterm infants to feed enterally frequently leads to the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in order to provide adequate calories and nutrients to promote growth. Most commercial parenteral solutions contain a mixture of both essential and non-essential amino acids. Low plasma levels of any essential amino acid indicate a relative deficiency state and this may be detrimental to nitrogen balance and growth (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1955</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:58:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several facts suggest that the addition of L-cysteine, cystine or N-acetylcysteine to TPN may be beneficial in neonates, especially very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (infants with birth weight &lt; 1500 g) .</P>
<P>Several publications have suggested that L-cysteine could be a conditionally essential (i.e., essential under certain conditions) amino acid for very preterm but not for borderline preterm or full-term neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heird-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riedijk-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedijk 2006</LINK>). In contrast, one randomized trial comparing various intakes of cyst(e)ine in enterally fed very low birth weight infants did not support the hypothesis that cyst(e)ine is a conditionally essential amino acid in these infants. (<LINK REF="REF-Riedijk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedijk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riedijk-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedijk 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cysteine is incorporated into proteins and is a precursor of taurine and glutathione. In adults, cysteine can be synthesized from ingested methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway and hence is considered one of the non-essential amino acids (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1955</LINK>). In the fetus, hepatic cystathionase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts cystathionine to cysteine, is either absent or barely detectable, resulting in decreased synthesis of cysteine from methionine and high serum concentration of cystathionine (<LINK REF="REF-Sturman-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturman 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascal-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascal 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaull-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaull 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinonen-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinonen 1974</LINK>). Preterm infants have higher plasma cystathionine levels than term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Vi_x00f1_a-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viña 1995</LINK>). Hepatic cystathionase activity increases with gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Sturman-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturman 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinonen-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinonen 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zlotkin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlotkin 1982</LINK>) and increases rapidly after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Zlotkin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlotkin 1982</LINK>) reaching mature levels at about three months in term infants. <I>In vivo</I> studies have shown that cysteine synthesized in preterm liver may be present in apolipoprotein B but not in plasma, suggesting that endogenous cysteine is used preferentially for hepatic protein synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>). In contrast, a recent study showed that cysteine synthesized in the liver was found in plasma of VLBW infants in amounts that increased with maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Shew-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shew 2005</LINK>). Extrahepatic cystathionase, which matures earlier than the hepatic enzyme, might account for some conversion of methionine into cysteine even in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:57:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parenterally fed infants or adults who do not receive cysteine supplements in TPN have low plasma levels of cystine (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>), the oxidized, disulfide form of cysteine. Regression analysis suggests that an intravenous intake of cysteine of 500 micromoles per kg per day is required in preterm infants to reach plasma cysteine levels comparable to those in full-term, breast-fed infants (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Goudoever-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Goudoever 1994</LINK>). Snyderman found that enteral supplementation of cysteine improved growth in preterm infants at two to four months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Snyderman-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyderman 1971</LINK>). These data support the possibility that cysteine may be a conditionally essential amino acid in preterm infants; supplementation of cysteine could improve growth and nitrogen retention under certain conditions. Liver toxicity may be induced by high methionine content of commercial parenteral nutritional solutions that do not contain cysteine (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2000</LINK>). Because of this, some manufacturers have added cysteine to commercial TPN and reduced methionine content accordingly. Supplementation of an essential amino acid (in this case cysteine) may not result in any improvement in growth if caloric intake or intake of other essential or conditionally essential nutrients (e.g., tyrosine) is limiting (<LINK REF="REF-Helms-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helms 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heird-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies have suggested that preterm infants have a poorly developed antioxidant system, making various organs more susceptible to oxidation injury, thereby increasing the risk for intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Thibeault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thibeault 2000</LINK>). Cysteine deficiency may be an etiological factor in the limited ability of preterm babies to produce glutathione, a natural antioxidant. The first step of synthesis of glutathione involves gammma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which mediates a peptide linkage between glutamate and cysteine. Studies have demonstrated a decrease in glutathione synthesis in erythrocytes of neonates when methionine was used as a cysteine precursor (<LINK REF="REF-Vi_x00f1_a-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viña 1995</LINK>). The effect was more pronounced in preterm infants less than 32 weeks of age. Supplementation of parenteral nutrition with cysteine increases endogenous synthesis of taurine and glutathione (<LINK REF="REF-Shew-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shew 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Taurine is present in all cells and is conjugated to biliary pigments, which are excreted into bile as soluble biliary salts. In adults, taurine can be synthesized from cysteine and methionine. However, in preterm infants, taurine is also considered a conditionally essential amino acid. Taurine needs to be included in parenteral solutions to prevent cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adding cysteine-hydrochloride (cysteine-HCl) to TPN solutions increases calcium and phosphate solubility. Cysteine-HCl reduces the pH of TPN significantly (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parikh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 2005</LINK>), thereby increasing calcium and phosphate solubility and allowing increased mineral intake, a limiting factor in mineral accretion in preterm infants receiving TPN. Increased mineral accretion could reduce the incidence of osteopenia of prematurity and fractures in VLBW infants. However, acidification of the TPN by cysteine-chloride in the smallest infants (especially those &lt; 1250 g) may be associated with metabolic acidosis for the first two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heird-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1988</LINK>). Such metabolic acidosis can be prevented by the administration of base (acetate or lactate) at a 2:1 molar (base:cysteine hydrochloride) ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1991</LINK>).</P>

<U>Stability of cysteine in TPN</U>
</B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>The poor stability of cysteine in commercial amino acid solutions has led to the development of cysteine substitutes with greater stability. Cysteine is easily oxidized to cystine, which precipitates rapidly and is virtually insoluble in TPN solutions. In solutions containing both cysteine and glucose, the cysteine content of the fluid decreases by 40% within the first 10 hours from both oxidization and formation of D-glucocysteine (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelton 1990</LINK>). N-acetyl-cysteine, a soluble precursor, improves stability in solution, thereby allowing higher total concentrations of cysteine, cystine and its precursor in TPN. However, plasma cystine levels have been shown to be less than one third the lower limit of the reference range when cyst(e)ine intake consisted of small doses and no correlation was found between plasma cystine levels and N-acetyl-cysteine intake at these doses (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Goudoever-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Goudoever 1994</LINK>).</P>

<B>Review Authors' note:</B>
<BR/>In this review, international units (micromoles) were used. The molecular weights of cysteine-hydrochloride and N-acetyl-cysteine are, respectively, 157.7 and 163.2. Therefore, to convert micromole to mg, multiply by 0.1577 and 0.1632, respectively.</P>

</U>Specific information about these six studies is presented in the table entitled "Characteristics of Included Studies." All six trials allocated individual patients. Five trials used a parallel design, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>) a cross-over design. Five trials randomized cysteine and one (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>) used N-acetylcysteine supplementation. All trials used parenteral supplementation (of cysteine or N-acetylcysteine) versus placebo or control. Five studies enrolled exclusively preterm infants, and (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) enrolled preterm infants and full-term infants. Inadequate nitrogen intake was documented in a subset of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) used as baseline amino acid solution Aminosyn (Abbott Laboratories), which contains neither tyrosine, nor cysteine in any form. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>) used as baseline amino acid solution Vaminolac (Fresenius-Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden), which contains cysteine, cystine and tyrosine. The other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>) presumably (<LINK REF="REF-Heird-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shew-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shew 2000a</LINK>) used Trophamine, which contains N-acetyltyrosine and no cysteine.

<P>When all trials were analyzed, it appeared that they belonged to two groups which differed in many characteristics: enrolled patients (large range of birth weight and gestational age versus exclusively extremely low birth weight [ELBW] infants), cysteine content of the baseline parenteral nutrition (PN) (cysteine-free PN versus cysteine-containing PN), intervention (cysteine versus N-acetylcysteine), and PN (TPN versus partial PN). The first group included five small (36 patients or less) trials, involving patients with a wide range of birth weights and gestational ages, which analyzed the effects of short-term cysteine (0.5 - 1 millimoles/kg/day) supplementation of cysteine-free PN (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) on growth (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>), nitrogen retention (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) and plasma levels of cysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>). The second group included a single large multicenter RCT involving 391 ELBW infants, which analyzed the effects of N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>) on growth, death, death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis (operated), periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage and plasma cysteine levels.<BR/>The only outcome variable for the cross-over study that is reported in this systematic review is the plasma level of cysteine.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 20. They were allocated to one of three arms: treatment arm (1) n = 7, treatment arm (2) n = 6, and control group n = 7. Entry criteria included: VLBW infants receiving total parenteral nutrition. The mean birth weight was 1010 g and mean gestational age 27.8 weeks. Patients in treatment arm (1) received intravenous cysteine supplementation at a dose of 1 millimole/kg/day in the parenteral solution, those in treatment arm (2) received the same dose of cysteine infused separately, and controls received no supplementation. For the purpose of this systematic review, the two treatment arms were combined as described in the method section. The duration of supplementation was not provided. Outcome variables included nitrogen retention and plasma free cysteine concentration. Caloric and nitrogen intake were not provided.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 20, including ten in the treatment group and ten in the control group. Entry criteria included: preterm infants at least two days old, unable to take enteral feeds and unlikely to begin enteral feeding within five to seven days; or without enteral intake for 48 hours and unable to tolerate enteral feeds for at least five to seven days. Birth weight ranged between 900 g and 2500 g, and postnatal age between three and 53 days; gestational age is not provided. Patients were randomized to receive either cysteine-hydrochloride (Cysteine-HCl, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Chicago, IL) (72 mg/kg/day or 0.46 millimoles/kg/day) added to the parental solution for 6 days, or no cysteine supplementation. Randomization was stratified by the amount of nitrogen intake: those receiving low nitrogen intake (1.5 g/kg/day of amino acids) and those receiving higher nitrogen intake (2.5 g/kg/day of amino acids). In this systematic review, merged data (combining groups with different levels of nitrogen intake) and original data (separate groups by nitrogen intake) were both evaluated. Amino acids were provided by Aminosyn (Abbott Laboratories), which contains neither cysteine, nor tyrosine in any form. Non-protein calories ranged between 63 and 73 kcal/kg/day. Outcome variables included weight gain (no SD provided), nitrogen retention, and plasma levels of total and free cysteine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 19, including nine in the treatment group and ten in the control group. Entry criteria included: neonates receiving parenteral nutrition. Patients were randomized to receive either cysteine hydrochloride supplementation (0.78 [SD 0.10] millimoles/kg/day) in parenteral nutrition for 5.9 (SD 1.5) days versus no supplementation for 6.8 (SD 1.6) days. The main outcome variable was the nitrogen balance during the final 48 hours of the study. Caloric intake was 92 (SD 12) kcal/kg/day in the treatment group and 99 (SD 19) kcal/kg/day in the control group, and amino acid intake was 2.9 (SD 0.3) and 2.7 (SD 0.3) g/kg/day, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 18. The entry criteria included: low birth weight, gestational age 30 - 37 weeks, postnatal age less than four weeks, requiring PN for at least two weeks. Exclusion criteria included: inborn genetic error or significant organ failure. Target PN dosage was 2.5 g/kg of amino acids with total caloric intake of 135 kcal/kg/day. After a three-day PN without cysteine, infants were randomly allocated to a series of six three-day dosing schedules of cysteine hydrochloride, ranging between 0 and 40 mg cysteine hydrochloride per g of amino acids. For this systematic review we compared the levels of cyst(e)ine on 40 mg of cysteine hydrochloride per g of amino acid (treatment) versus 0 mg/g (control). Outcome variables included plasma levels of taurine, cystine and methionine.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 36, including 18 in the treatment group and 18 in the control group. Entry criteria included: Infants (age 2 - 46 days) receiving total parenteral nutrition. The average birth weight in the treatment group and the control group was, respectively, 2231 g (SD 1659 g) and 2141 g (SD 1515 g); average gestational age was, respectively, 34.4 weeks (SD 8.5) and 34.2 weeks (SD 9.3); average postnatal age was 13.7 days (SD 23.3) and 15 days (SD 23.8). Patients were allocated to receive either cysteine hydrochloride supplementation (Abbott Laboratories) (77 mg/kg/day of cysteine or 0.64 millimoles/kg/day) for 6 days or no supplementation. Both groups received an average of 87 kcal/kg/day and 3.2 g/kg/day of protein. Amino acids were provided by Aminosyn (Abbott), which contains neither cysteine, nor tyrosine in any form. Outcome variables included weight gain, changes in length and head circumference, nitrogen balance and plasma levels of cysteine and hemicystine.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>: The total number of patients entered into the study was 391, including 194 in the treatment group and 197 in the control group. Entry criteria included: Infants weighing 500 to 999 grams and on ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure before the age of 36 hours. Patients were treated according to the routine procedures in each intensive care unit and received PN and some enteral nutrition. Average birth weights in the treatment group and the control group, were respectively, 0.776 kg (SD 0.128 kg) and 0.78 kg (SD 0.134 kg); average gestational ages 26.3 weeks (SD 1.7) and 26.5 weeks (SD 1.8). Patients were randomized to either intravenous N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Parvolex, Evans, UK or Mucomyst, Draco Läkemedel AB, Lund, Sweden) at a constant rate of 16 - 32 mg/kg/day (0.10-0.20 millimole/kg/day, calculated on the basis of birth weight, with the smallest infants receiving the lowest dosages for six days versus placebo (0.9% sodium chloride or solvent of Mucomyst). The dosage was based on a pharmacokinetic study, aiming at a steady-state plasma concentrations of N-acetyl-L-cysteine of 100 - 300 micromoles/L (<LINK REF="REF-Ahola-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahola 1999</LINK>). Both groups received a commercial intravenous amino acid solution (Vaminolac, Fresenius-Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden), which contains 1 mg/ml of cysteine + cystine, and 0.5 mg/ml tyrosine. Amino acid intake was started on day one or two, with the first dose 8 ml/kg/day, and increased daily to a maximum of 40 - 60 ml/kg/day (0.33 - 0.50 millimoles/kg/day of cysteine equivalent). The primary outcome was death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia by 36 postmenstrual weeks. Secondary outcomes included death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis (operated), periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage and plasma cysteine levels. Dr. Ahola provided us with the standard deviation of cysteine levels at the end of therapy and with unpublished individual data on weight.</P>

<B>Growth (Outcomes 1.1 - 1.3</B>):<BR/>Effects on growth (gains in weight, length or head circumference) were reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK> found no statistically significant effects on either weight gain (mean difference [MD] -4.1 g/kg/day, 95% CI -9.7, +1.5), length gain (MD 0 cm/6 days, 95% CI -0.41, +0.41), or head circumference (MD 0.3 cm/ 6 days, 95% CI -0.11, + 0.71). Malloy stated that there was no statistically significant effect of cysteine supplementation on weight gain, but reported only means and ranges. Thus, we could not combine these data in meta-analysis.</P>

<B>Nitrogen retention (Outcome 1.4</B>):<BR/>Effects on nitrogen retention was reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>). Cysteine supplementation significantly increased nitrogen retention, WMD 31.8 mg/kg/day, 95% CI +8.2, +55.4. Sensitivity analysis did not significantly affect the results.<BR/>Subgroup analyses showed significant improvement in nitrogen retention when analyzing infants without documented low intake of other nutrients, RCTs only, preterm infants only, but not in patients with documented low nitrogen intake (<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>), in those infants with documented lack of tyrosine intake (<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) or in full-term infants (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>).

<B>Plasma level of free cyst(e)ine (Outcome 1.5)</B>:<BR/>The effect of cysteine supplementation on free plasma cyst(e)ine concentration at the end of therapy was reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>). Cysteine supplementation significantly increased free plasma cyst(e)ine levels (MD 2.48 micromoles/100 ml, 95% CI 1.44,3.53). There was significant heterogeneity between the trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses also showed a significant increase in plasma free cyst(e)ine levels in RCTs only, in patients with demonstrated low nitrogen intake, those patients with lack of tyrosine intake, those patients with no documented low intake of or other nutrients, and in preterm infants, but not in full-term infants.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-20 11:00:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials analyzed the effects of short-term cysteine supplementation on some of the predefined outcomes for this systematic review. All trials but one enrolled preterm infants only. The quality of the trials ranged from high-quality multicenter RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>) to small quasi-randomized trials published as abstracts only and providing only some of the important parameters required to assess quality.</P>
<P>As discussed previously, the six trials described and analyzed in this systematic review are best presented in two separate groups. Cysteine-supplementation of cysteine-free PN was analyzed in five small trials in which the authors were mainly interested in nitrogen retention and amino acid levels. Limitations of these trials include small size, lack of adequate or unclear evidence of allocation blinding (n = 3), and abstract publication only (n = 3). In contrast, N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN was analyzed in a large high-quality multicenter trial in which the authors analyzed mortality and morbidity.</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Cysteine supplementation of cysteine-free PN:</U>
<BR/>
</B>There was a discrepancy between the effects of cysteine supplementation on growth and those on nitrogen balance. One quasi-randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>) showed no effects of cysteine supplementation on weight, length, head circumference or nitrogen retention in full-term and preterm infants. <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK> showed that cysteine supplementation significantly increased nitrogen balance and stated it did not affect weight gain. In contrast, summary statistics showed that cysteine supplementation significantly increased nitrogen retention. These discrepancies in growth outcome may have resulted from differences in entry criteria, study duration, or nutritional intake other than cysteine. Cysteine is thought to be a conditionally essential amino acid, as shown by a study showing reduction in proteolysis and improvement in protein balance with simultaneous cysteine and tyrosine (or N-acetyltyrosine) supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pointdexter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pointdexter 2000</LINK>). The effect of cysteine or N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation on growth and nitrogen balance may depend on adequacy of tyrosine (or N-acetyltyrosine) intake (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Zlotkin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotkin 1981</LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Malloy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Malloy 1984</LINK> used Aminosyn, which contained no tyrosine, as opposed to Aminosyn PF, which contains tyrosine (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2004</LINK>). More recent studies used either Vaminolac (Fresenius-Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden), which contains tyrosine (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>) or presumably Trophamine, which contains N-acetyltyrosine (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 2003</LINK>). The latter yields normal levels for virtually all amino acids except for low levels of cysteine (<LINK REF="REF-Heird-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heird-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1988</LINK>). Subgroup analysis supports the hypothesis that the discrepancy between lack of improved nitrogen retention weight gain in two studies published in the 80's and significant improved nitrogen in two more recent studies may have resulted from lack of tyrosine in the first two studies.</P>
<P>Lack of data on mortality, toxicity (especially metabolic acidosis), or other short-term and long-term morbidity, and lack of any study using long-term cysteine supplementation prevent us from giving a strong recommendation about the routine use of cysteine supplementation of cysteine-free PN. Since data are insufficient to make a strong recommendation, we recommend a large randomized trial (see Conclusion).</P>
<P>
<U>N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in ELBW infants: </U>
<BR/>N-acetylcysteine supplementation (6-day course at a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 millimoles/kg/day) of cysteine-containing PN in EVLBW infants had no significant effect on primary and secondary outcomes in a large multicenter trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>), except for a significant decrease in cysteine levels at the end of therapy. Possible reasons for these findings are multiple. First, glutathione deficiency is unlikely to be the single mechanism of oxidation injury. Second, glutathione levels were similar in both groups, suggesting that cysteine and cystine provided in PN prevented glutathione deficiency in both groups, thereby minimizing any effect of N-acetylcysteine supplementation. Third, lack of efficacy of N-acetylcysteine supplementation in VLBW infants may be due in part to urinary loss of acetylated amino acids (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Goudoever-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Goudoever 1994</LINK>); however, the dosage used in this study led to adequate plasma levels of N-acetylcysteine. Although plasma cysteine levels were lower in N-acetylcysteine-supplemented infants than in controls, the increase in plasma cysteine levels from day three to day seven, i.e., from baseline to the end of the study was similar in the two arms of the trial. N-acetylcysteine may enter into the cells, where it can be deacetylated into cysteine (<LINK REF="STD-Ahola-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahola 2003</LINK>). Fourth, lack of efficacy of N-acetylcysteine supplementation may have resulted from too short an intervention. Finally, sample size was sufficient to detect changes in the primary outcome, but insufficient for secondary outcomes (e.g., periventricular leukomalacia). Lack of any significant effect of N-acetylcysteine supplementation on mortality or any of the other outcomes in this large trial argues against the use of this supplementation in this setting.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-20 11:00:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Available evidence from RCTs shows that routine short-term cysteine chloride supplementation of cysteine-free PN in preterm infants improves nitrogen balance. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the risks of this supplementation, especially regarding metabolic acidosis, which has been reported during the first two weeks of cysteine chloride administration. Such acidosis may mostly affect the most immature infants during the first week of life. </P>
<P>Available evidence from one large RCT trial does not support routine N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-20 11:00:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large double-blind RCT would be required to assess whether routine prolonged cysteine supplementation affects quantitative (weight, length, head circumference, nitrogen retention) and qualitative (body composition), and short- and long-term neonatal outcomes in VLBW infants receiving cysteine-free PN. Patients should receive a cysteine-free amino acid solution that yields recommended amino acid concentrations (including tyrosine) except for cysteine, and adequate amounts of calories. To assess the effect of cysteine supplementation on bone mineral content, supplementation should be continued beyond two weeks, until cysteine-induced metabolic acidosis is expected to resolve, thereby allowing investigators to stop alkalinization of the PN solution and thus increase its mineral content. The design of this double-blind trial should allow the pharmacist to optimize mineral intake, based on solubility curves of calcium and phosphate in PN solutions (taking into account amino acids and pH) (Parikh 2005), without exceeding recommended osmolality.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Total number of patients entered into the study: 391. Entry criteria: Infants weighing 500 to 999 grams and on ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure before the age of 36 hours. Average birth weight in the treatment group and the control group, respectively, 776 g (SD 128 g) and 780 g (SD 134 g) ; average gestational age 26.3 weeks (SD 1.7) and 26.5 weeks (SD 1.8); average postnatal age 24 hours (SD 9) and 23 hours (SD 9).</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intravenous N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Parvolex, Evans, UK) or Mucomyst (Draco Läkemedel AB, Lund, Sweden) 16-32 mg/kg/day (0.10-0.20 millimole/kg/day) for 6 days (n = 194); versus placebo (0.9% sodium chloride or solvent of Mucomyst) (n = 197).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome of the main manuscript: death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia by 36 postmenstrual weeks. Secondary outcomes: death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis (operated), periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage and plasma cysteine levels on days 3 and 7. In addition to the original report, the authors also analyzed subgroups, one in which they found no effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine supplementation on pulmonary function (Sandberg 2004), and one in which they found evidence for lipid peroxidation (Ahola 2004). Dr. Ahola has generously provided us with data on weight and on plasma cysteine levels. Long-term follow-up data are not available yet. No data were available on bone accretion or level of acidosis.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Both groups received an amino acid solution (Vaminolac, Fresenius-Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden) containing 1 mg/ml of cysteine + cystine, and 0.5 mg/ml tyrosine, and providing a dose of cysteine starting at 8 mg/kg/day on day 1 or 2 and increasing daily up to 40-60 mg/kg/day (0.33-0.50 millimoles/kg/day of cysteine equivalent).

<P>In the review you specify two primary outcomes: 1) Growth 2) Nitrogen Retention. However, in the review protocol, Growth is listed as the single most important primary outcome, while nitrogen retention was a secondary outcome.  </P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-10-05 14:21:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the protocol there was a typographical error: there was a mismatch between aim, objectives and outcomes: nitrogen retention was listed as primary in aim and objectives and as secondary in outcome measures. This mismatch was corrected in the review.</P>
