<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-03 13:46:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is caused by a rapid change in head movement. The person feels they or their surroundings are moving or rotating. Common causes are head trauma or ear infection. BPPV can be caused by debris in the semicircular canal of the ear, which continues to move after the head has stopped moving. This causes a sensation of ongoing movement that conflicts with other sensory information. The Epley manoeuvre is a treatment that is performed by a doctor (or other health personnel with appropriate training, e.g. audiological scientist, physiotherapist) and involves a series of four movements of the head and body from sitting to lying, rolling over and back to sitting. It is understood to work by moving the canal debris out of the semicircular canal. This <A HREF="http://youtu.be/mx1VoQtDquc">linked video</A> demonstrates how the Epley manoeuvre is performed.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 11 studies in the review, with a total of 745 participants. Five studies (334 patients) compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre, three against other particle repositioning manoeuvres (Semont, Brandt-Daroff and Gans) and three with a control (no treatment, medication only, postural restriction). Patients were treated in hospital otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) departments in eight studies and family practices in two studies. All patients were adults aged 18 to 90 years old, with a sex ratio of 1:1.5 male to female.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>For resolution of vertigo the Epley manoeuvre was significantly more effective than a sham manoeuvre or control. None of the trials that compared Epley versus other particle repositioning manoeuvres reported vertigo resolution as an outcome.</P>
<P>When studies looked at the conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test (a test to diagnose BPPV) in the patients, the results significantly favoured the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control. There was no difference when Epley was compared with the Semont or Gans manoeuvre. In one study a single Epley treatment was more effective than a week of three times daily Brandt-Daroff exercises.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were not often reported. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. Rates of nausea during the repositioning manoeuvre varied from 16.7% to 32%. Some patients were unable to tolerate the manoeuvres because of cervical spine (neck) problems.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that the Epley manoeuvre is safe and effective in the short term. Other specific sequences of physical movements, the Semont and Gans manoeuvres, have similar results.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There was a low risk of overall bias in the studies included. All trials were randomised, with five studies applying sealed envelope or external allocation techniques. Seven of the trials blinded the assessors to the patients' treatment group and data on all outcomes for all participants were reported in most studies. This evidence is up to date to January 2014.</P>

<P>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo (a sensation of instability, often with a sensation of rotation) in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology, neuro-otology, neurology and audiological clinics. There are a number of aetiologies associated with secondary BPPV. Common causes appear to be head trauma (17%) and vestibular neuritis (inflammation or infection of the nerve supplying the vestibule; an important part of the balance system) (15%) (<LINK REF="REF-Baloh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baloh 1987</LINK>). Other putative causes include vertebrobasilar ischaemia (reduced blood flow in the area of the brain supplied by the basilar artery), labyrinthitis (inflammation or infection of the inner ear), as a complication of middle ear surgery and following periods of prolonged bed rest. However, most cases appear to be idiopathic (without known cause), with secondary BPPV being responsible for approximately 10% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-von-Brevern-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Brevern 2007</LINK>). Presentation may be atypical in elderly patients: less typical positioning symptoms and more frequent complaints of dizziness between attacks, leading to delayed diagnosis and subsequent treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Oghalai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oghalai 2000</LINK>)</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence and prevalence</HEADING>
<P>The peak incidence of idiopathic BPPV is between 50 and 70 years of age, although the condition is found amongst all age groups. The incidence of idiopathic BPPV ranges from 11 to 64 per 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Froehling-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froehling 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizukoshi-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizukoshi 1988</LINK>), increases by approximately 38% per decade of life and is twice as common in females as males. The lifetime prevalence is 2.4% (<LINK REF="REF-von-Brevern-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Brevern 2007</LINK>). Sex distribution is about equal for post-traumatic and post-vestibular neuritis (<LINK REF="REF-Baloh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baloh 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katsarkas-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsarkas 1978</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Balance is normally achieved by brain centres that monitor and synthesise information from the eyes, the vestibular system (part of the inner ear) and position sensors in major joints. Angular acceleration (i.e. turning movements) is detected by the semicircular canals. There are three semicircular canals set in orthogonal planes in each ear (six semicircular canals in total: each ear providing reciprocal information) and they are therefore well placed to detect angular acceleration in any plane of head movement. The lateral semicircular canals are filled with a fluid called endolymph. The main sense organ in each canal is called the crista, which is stimulated by movement of the cupula. Head rotation causes relative movement of the endolymph in the semicircular canal, which bends the cupula and the embedded hairs of the hair cells and causes stimulation of the relevant vestibular nerve.</P>
<P>The cause of benign positional vertigo is believed to be canalithiasis, principally affecting the posterior semicircular canal. In canalithiasis, free-floating debris in the semicircular canal is hypothesised to act like a plunger, causing continuing movement of the endolymph even after head movement has ceased. This causes movement of the cupula and bending of the hairs of the hair cells, and provokes vertigo.</P>
<P>An alternate theory, cupulolithiasis, asserts that canal debris becomes attached to the cupula whose specific gravity is normally the same as endolymph but with attached debris would become heavier, thus responding to any change in gravitational position of the head (rather than angular acceleration).</P>
<P>The latter theory has become less favoured, in part, with the introduction of positioning techniques to treat BPPV. With free-floating debris (canalithiasis), successively turning the head should continue to provoke nystagmus (repeated jerky movements of the eyes) in the same direction if the direction of rotation remains constant: the debris sinks to the most gravitationally dependent position of the canal each time. However, cupulolithiasis would predict a change in direction of the nystagmus as the head continues to turn. The heavy cupula under the influence of gravity should deviate in the opposite direction as the crista of the semicircular canal passes through the vertical plane. Clinical observation during positional manoeuvres confirms that when the direction of rotation is constant the direction of the nystagmus remains the same. The horizontal and anterior canals may also be affected by canalithiasis, although less frequently. When the aetiology is secondary to a labyrinthitis or end organ ischaemic injury (reduced blood supply causing damage to vital sensory cells) other components of the vestibular system in addition to a discrete posterior semicircular canal lesion may be affected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Patients with posterior canal BPPV typically have episodic vertigo in association with a rapid change in head position, particularly movement relative to gravity and involving neck extension. The vertigo typically lasts for anything from a few seconds to one minute. Attacks may be associated with nausea, and the nausea may persist for much longer than the sensation of vertigo: sometimes for a few hours. Typical manoeuvres provoking vertigo include lying down in bed, extending the neck to reach up for objects on high shelves, bending over and sitting up from supine. A patient's balance is usually normal between episodes. Exceptions to this would be those situations in which BPPV occurs in association with a partial vestibular paresis, e.g. following vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis, where sudden head movements of any sort may provoke momentary sense of vertigo, or aetiologies such as ischaemic end organ damage that compromise other vestibular receptors. Horizontal canal BPPV typically causes vertigo when turning over in bed from side to side.</P>
<P>Many cases of BPPV resolve spontaneously within a few weeks or months. Attacks tend to occur in clusters and symptoms may recur after an apparent period of remission. It is important to distinguish BPPV from central positional vertigo (which may occur with multiple sclerosis, cerebellar disease and brainstem ischaemia), in which one of more of the classical features of BPPV will be absent. There may be no latent period, no fatiguability of the nystagmus, nystagmus which is not classically rotatory and the provocation is not always associated with nausea or a sensation of vertigo, which is typically quite intense for patients with BPPV.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The Dix-Hallpike test (Hallpike manoeuvre) (<LINK REF="REF-Dix-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dix 1952</LINK>), or the lateral head-trunk tilt (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 1999</LINK>), are used to confirm the diagnosis of posterior canal BPPV. A positive test provokes vertigo and nystagmus when a patient is rapidly moved from a sitting position to lying with the head tipped 45 degrees below the horizontal, 45 degrees to the side and with the side of the affected ear (and semicircular canal) downwards. (Please see <A HREF="http://youtu.be/kEM9p4EX1jk">linked video</A> demonstrating a positive Dix-Hallpike test). The nystagmus typically has a latency of a few seconds before onset and fatigues after approximately 30 to 40 seconds. The nystagmus is rotatory with the fast phase beating towards the lower ear (geotropic). The nystagmus adapts with repeated testing. Further investigation is not recommended or required to make the diagnosis of BPPV in this clinical context (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharyya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharyya 2008</LINK>). The sensitivity and specificity of the Dix-Hallpike test are 79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65% to 94%) and 75% (95% CI 33% to 100%) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Halker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halker 2008</LINK>). Optic fixation (the eyes being able to fix on a specific object) may reduce the severity of the nystagmus and it is possible to test patients wearing Frenzel glasses (glasses with strong prisms for lenses, which remove the ability of the eyes to focus on an object). However, increasing the sensitivity of the Hallpike manoeuvre by wearing Frenzel glasses will reduce its specificity, since asymptomatic normal subjects can develop positional nystagmus on positional testing when optic fixation is removed. A proportion of patients with a typical history of posterior canal BPPV, who have a negative Hallpike manoeuvre on the first occasion, may demonstrate a positive test on retesting after a period of a few days, or have reproducible symptoms and paroxysmal nystagmus when testing with positional electronystagmography. (ENG involves a special headset worn by the patient during positional movements. Any eye movements are objectively measured and recorded by electrodes placed around the eyes) (<LINK REF="REF-Norre-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norre 1995</LINK>). There are no other specific investigations that can confirm or exclude the diagnosis of BPPV.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment <I>o</I>ptions</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of treatment options available for posterior canal BPPV. In many cases, spontaneous remission occurs before medical advice is sought, and patients may simply seek an explanation for their symptoms without needing or demanding treatment. Regular medication (e.g. betahistine hydrochloride, prochlorperazine) is rarely prescribed as a treatment since there is no pathophysiological rationale for these agents to be effective, although vestibular suppressants and antihistamines may provide partial relief of nausea that can persist after acute attacks.</P>
<P>In extreme circumstances, patients with frequent episodes of intractable vertigo showing no sign of spontaneous remission may require or seek surgical treatment. This includes vestibular neurectomy, where the singular nerve which selectively supplies the posterior semicircular canal is divided. Although the debris may continue to cause abnormal deflection of the cupula, the resulting sensory signal can no longer reach the brainstem for higher processing. In posterior semicircular canal obliteration surgery the posterior semicircular canal is exposed by drilling away part of the mastoid bone, and then packed firmly to obliterate the endolymphatic channel, thus also effectively removing the ability of the semicircular canal to produce aberrant sensory information.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The Epley manoeuvre</HEADING>
<P>Brandt-Daroff exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 1980</LINK>) and canalith repositioning manoeuvres (<LINK REF="REF-Epley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semont-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semont 1988</LINK>) are the main therapies for most patients who seek active treatment for their symptoms. They are purported to act by dispersion of the canal debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the utricle, where it is inactive. These modalities of treatment all have a sequence of head and/or trunk positioning manoeuvres as a common factor. In recent years the Epley manoeuvre has become particularly popular (<LINK REF="REF-Epley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epley 1992</LINK>). The technique involves a series of four movements of the head and body from sitting to lying, rolling over and back to sitting. (Please see <A HREF="http://youtu.be/mx1VoQtDquc">linked video</A> demonstrating how the Epley manoeuvre is performed). The technique can be modified by the addition of a headband which vibrates, putatively to encourage the movement of the particles through the semicircular canals (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1995</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>All 11 studies were randomised controlled trials. The assessors were blinded in eight trials. In four trials the patients were also blinded by receiving a realistic 'sham' physical treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>Sample sizes were generally small, ranging from 36 to 103 patients in total, with published data on a total of 745 patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Two trials were conducted in a primary care setting (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2012</LINK>); the remainder were conducted in secondary or tertiary care in otolaryngology departments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All the trials addressed the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in adults only. The age range of participants was 18 to 90 years. The male to female ratio was 1:1.5 across the seven trials where gender was listed as a baseline characteristic.</P>
<P>In 10 of the studies a clinical diagnosis of BPPV was based on clinical history and examination including a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Where the inclusion criteria did not explicitly state a positive Dix-Hallpike test for inclusion, the application of a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome suggested that a positive test was implicit in the diagnosis of BPPV for inclusion and we assumed this. One trial applied an alternative provocation test (<LINK REF="STD-Dispenza-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dispenza 2012</LINK>), a side-lying test to reproduce symptoms in the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Halker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halker 2008</LINK>). Although less commonly used than the Dix-Hallpike test it is a recognised assessment tool and does not introduce bias into the trial since it was applied across all treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial compared the treated group against untreated controls (<LINK REF="STD-Yimtae-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yimtae 2003</LINK>). Four studies from earlier versions of the published review and one recent publication used 'sham' treatments that were comparable to an Epley treatment in terms of movement, time taken and contact with researchers. Other recent studies sought to compare the Epley treatment against the Semont manoeuvre (<LINK REF="STD-Dispenza-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dispenza 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazoor-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mazoor 2011</LINK>), Brandt-Daroff exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Amor-Dorado-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Amor Dorado 2012</LINK>), and the hybrid Gans manoeuvre (<LINK REF="STD-Dispenza-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dispenza 2012</LINK>). In two studies, all patients had either medication (<LINK REF="STD-Liang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2010</LINK>) or postural restrictions (<LINK REF="STD-Xie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2012</LINK>) prescribed and the experimental group received the Epley treatment as an additional intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All trials reported conversion of the Dix-Hallpike test from positive to negative as a primary outcome measure. Three trials made no mention of symptoms at follow-up, reporting only the result of the Dix-Hallpike test (<LINK REF="STD-Amor-Dorado-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Amor Dorado 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dispenza-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dispenza 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazoor-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mazoor 2011</LINK>). Two studies asked participants to complete a diary of symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Froehling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Froehling 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lynn 1995</LINK>). Other studies relied solely on patients' reports of symptoms during repeat Dix-Hallpike testing at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Brevern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">von Brevern 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials reported symptoms only up to four weeks maximum. In two trials, the effect of treatment was assessed immediately or after only 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Brevern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">von Brevern 2006</LINK>). However, two trials reported long-term follow-up of patients up to and including one year and four years respectively after treatment, considering the rate and frequency of recurrence as a secondary outcome measure of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Amor-Dorado-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Amor Dorado 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruintjes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bruintjes 2014</LINK>).</P>

No attempt was made to analyse differences in groups of patients who were improved but still had symptoms, or patients who failed to improve. <LINK REF="STD-Yimtae-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yimtae 2003</LINK> graded symptoms, but for the purpose of analysis these have been combined to give data for complete resolution, or not. A statistically significant difference in symptom resolution in favour of the treatment group was observed in each trial. Pooled trial data yield an odds ratio (OR) of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62 to 7.44; five studies, 273 participants; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 71%) in favour of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conversion of a positive Dix-Hallpike test to a negative Dix-Hallpike test</HEADING>
<P>In all trials there was a statistically significant difference in the conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test in favour of the treatment group. Pooled trial data yield an odds ratio of 9.62 (95% CI 6.0 to 15.42; eight studies, 507 participants, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 68%) in favour of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the two studies, which treated all patients with an 'active' treatment (either medication or postural restriction exercises) and then randomised half the patients to receive additionally a modified Epley treatment, the outcomes were reported as a composite measure of symptom resolution and Hallpike test result (<LINK REF="STD-Liang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2012</LINK>). For the purposes of analysis this has been rationalised to a dichotomous variable of 'cured' versus 'persisting symptoms'. There was a statistically significant effect of treatment in each trial at seven days, favouring the group that also received an Epley treatment in each case: OR 12.35 (95% CI 1.51 to 101.36) for <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2010</LINK> and OR 41.73 (95% CI 12.29 to 141.65) for <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2012</LINK>.</P>

<P>It is noteworthy that this is the only trial which addresses long-term recurrence of symptoms in a systematic way.

One patient (2.5%) experienced three recurrences.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-12-03 14:41:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 28 studies identified by the search strategy as being trials of the Epley manoeuvre in the treatment of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) were generally of low methodological quality, particularly in the key areas of allocation concealment and blinding of assessors to outcome. The principal patient-orientated outcome variable is subjective: resolution of a patient's symptoms of vertigo. We considered assessor blinding to be an important issue. Conversion to a negative Hallpike manoeuvre is the only objective marker of any physiological change resulting from treatment. Many patients, especially with relatively mild symptoms, can develop sophisticated strategies to avoid provoking symptoms on a day-to-day basis, and may self report as being 'symptom-free', but will still experience typical vertigo with appropriate provocation during a Dix-Hallpike test. Its inclusion as a secondary outcome measure is considered an important outcome variable.</P>
<P>We included 11 studies in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Amor-Dorado-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Amor Dorado 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruintjes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bruintjes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dispenza-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dispenza 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Froehling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Froehling 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazoor-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mazoor 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Brevern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">von Brevern 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yimtae-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yimtae 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2012</LINK>); these compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre or control group, or other particle repositioning manoeuvres. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There was no difference in resolution in comparison to the Semont manoeuvre. The Epley treatment resulted in a significantly higher resolution at seven days when compared to Brandt-Daroff exercises but after one month no difference was found.</P>
<P>The natural resolution of BPPV is an extremely important issue. In two included studies, 20% of control patients had resolution of their symptoms and 27% (<LINK REF="STD-Lynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lynn 1995</LINK>) and 38% (<LINK REF="STD-Froehling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Froehling 2000</LINK>) of control patients were found to have a negative Hallpike manoeuvre at follow-up. This emphasises that the natural history of posterior canal BPPV is for spontaneous resolution over time. In one of the studies included at the 2010 update, the authors explicitly stated that they sought to re-test patients after only 24 hours in an attempt to delineate the specific effect of treatment by minimising the confounding factor of spontaneous resolution (<LINK REF="STD-von-Brevern-2006" TYPE="STUDY">von Brevern 2006</LINK>). We excluded a study because although well randomised it was unblinded (<LINK REF="STD-Asawavichianginda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Asawavichianginda 2000</LINK>). Nonetheless, it does not seem inappropriate to note that after three months 84% of the control group (n = 25) who received no treatment had converted to a negative Hallpike manoeuvre. The majority of participants recruited in this study had symptoms for less than two weeks before inclusion in the trial. This would suggest that trials that include patients very early in the course of their disease and have only modest numbers may report no benefit of treatment if a large spontaneous resolution rate overshadows a genuine benefit of treatment (a type II statistical error: failing to demonstrate a real difference between treatment and control). This is precisely the circumstance where meta-analysis may clarify a treatment effect that is not explicit from individual randomised controlled trials. In contrast, the trial by Sridhar et al found only a 15% spontaneous resolution rate in the control group after 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Sridhar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sridhar 2003</LINK>). This variation is the most likely explanation for the heterogeneity noted in resolution of vertigo symptoms (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), where patients were recruited from different settings (tertiary care, secondary care, family practice) with varying duration of symptoms prior to inclusion. The natural history of untreated BPPV therefore remains unclear. If more trials are included in future updates of this review, we will consider a sensitivity analysis examining the effect size stratified by mean (or median) symptom duration. It might seem attractive to consider a 'minimum duration of symptoms' as a specific requirement for patient or trial inclusion in the review. However, such a decision would inevitably introduce a rather arbitrary inclusion criterion as there is no well founded basis for choosing a specific time period. Furthermore, imposing this type of criterion does not reflect day-to-day clinical practice. Most practitioners would offer a patient with BPPV treatment with the Epley manoeuvre at their first presentation, rather than deferring treatment to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, irrespective of the duration of their symptoms. If one accepts that the mechanism producing symptoms of posterior canal BPPV is similar for patients irrespective of symptom duration (as seems intuitive), there is no obvious reason why the Epley manoeuvre should be more or less effective at different times between the onset of the disease and its natural resolution. What is perhaps surprising is that the condition resolves spontaneously at all.</P>

<P>Long-term follow-up was lacking in most of the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Lynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lynn 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yimtae-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yimtae 2003</LINK> assessed patients one month after treatment completion and <LINK REF="STD-Froehling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Froehling 2000</LINK> assessed patients between one and two weeks after completion. <LINK REF="STD-Amor-Dorado-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Amor Dorado 2012</LINK> was notable in following patients for a period of 48 months after treatment. This demonstrated a 36% overall recurrence rate of BPPV. This study did not include untreated controls and it is not possible to comment on whether particle repositioning manoeuvres affect the long-term recurrence rate. <LINK REF="STD-Bruintjes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bruintjes 2014</LINK> followed patients for one year and in contrast found that of the 21 of 22 patients with symptom resolution after initial treatment, this effect was maintained at the 12-month follow-up with no recurrence.</P>

<P>Long-term recurrence of BPPV is common, with up to 36% of patients experiencing symptom recurrence over 48 months after successful initial treatment with the modified Epley manoeuvre, although research evidence on this subject is conflicting and based on only two small trials.</P>
<P>There is evidence from small numbers of patients that the Epley manoeuvre is comparable to the Semont and Gans manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV, but more effective than Brandt-Daroff exercises in the short term.</P>

<P>The original protocol included the Epley manoeuvre (either as classically described or with mastoid oscillation). Mastoid oscillation and other adjunctive treatments are now the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2012</LINK>). The change in protocol does not alter the inclusion of any trials up to and including the 2014 update.</P>
<P>No trials reported change in vertigo on the basis of frequency and/or severity as specified as original outcome measures. Vertigo was presented as a symptom that was either 'present' or 'absent'. We therefore changed the primary outcome measure to 'complete resolution of symptoms' at the 2014 update.</P>

The hybrid manoeuvre is an alternative particle repositioning manoeuvre (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Describe the Epley manoeuvre</P>
<P>1. The review is very valuable. It would be still more useful if it included or was linked to a detailed description of the Epley manoeuvre, and illustrated with one or more diagrams. The references to Epley's original paper and to the two trials reviewed are in rather obscure and not easily accessible places.</P>
<P>2. The coversheet states that various dates have "no been supplied by the reviewer". Surely most of this information must be in the editorial office or easily obtained by the CRG. </P>
<P>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a direct financial interest in the subject matter of my criticisms. AH</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Thank you for your comments.</P>
<P>1. A diagram of the Epley manoeuvre (from the original 1992 paper) has been reproduced with permission as an additional figure.</P>
<P>2. All relevant dates have been completed. Where not applicable dates are left necessarily blank. The Cochrane Library provides the default statement 'not supplied by reviewer' and we are unable to change this.</P>
