<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To assess the effects of puerarin in people with ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Stroke is a common cause of death and serious disability. Puerarin, a type of Chinese traditional medicine extracted from the root of <I>Pueraria lobata</I> (Willd.), commonly known as kudzu, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China. Previous studies implied potent antioxidation properties and neural protective effects, but whether current evidence provides support for recommending puerarin for routine use is still uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials up to August 2015 and included 20 randomised controlled trials involving 1574 participants, of puerarin for people with ischaemic stroke. Only two trials reported death or dependency at the end of follow-up. The remaining studies followed participants for less than one month.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We included 20 RCTs with 1574 participants in this updated review; five trials were new. Treatment with puerarin did not reduce death or dependency at final follow-up. Puerain improved neurological deficit at the end of treatment. The included trials did not report serious adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low due to incomplete reporting of the methods and short-term follow-up.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched August 2015). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1948 to August 2015), EMBASE (1980 to August 2015), AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, 1985 to August 2015) and the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc 1979 to August 2015).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:14:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 20 RCTs with 1574 participants in this updated review. All trials were published in Chinese language journals. We included 14 trials that we had excluded in the previous version of the review after we added a new outcome in this update. Time windows within which the participants were randomised ranged from 4.5 hours to 10 days. Ischaemic stroke was confirmed by computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 18 trials. Meta-analysis of two trials with 164 participants showed that treatment with puerarin did not reduce death or dependency at final follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.36). One trial with 83 participants reported that the mean value of the Barthel Index in the puerarin group was below that in the control group. Meta-analysis of 16 trials with 1305 participants showed that puerarin reduced the proportion of participants without improvement of neurological deficit at the end of follow-up (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.55). None of the included trials reported serious adverse effects.The quality of evidence was low due to incomplete reporting of the methods and short-term follow-up.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:00:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:15:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is a common cause of death and serious disability. Annually, 15 million people suffer a stroke. Of these, five million die, and another five million are left permanently disabled (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). Stroke is the second leading cause of death above the age of 60 and the fifth leading cause in people aged 15 to 59 years old (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). In China, which has a population of 1.4 billion people, the annual stroke mortality rate is approximately 157 per 100,000, or 1.6 million deaths per year, exceeding heart disease as the leading cause of adult death and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2011</LINK>). For people with ischaemic stroke, the only approved and validated drug therapies are aspirin and thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (in highly selected patients within three hours of stroke onset) , and regulatory approval has recently expanded (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2014</LINK>). Many other drug therapies have been evaluated, but these trials have either been inconclusive or negative. Therefore, it is necessary to test other promising strategies such as Chinese herbal medicine.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:00:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In China, many Chinese herb products are well accepted and have been widely used for centuries. Puerarin is one such drug, but its efficacy is uncertain. It is the primary extract from the root of <I>Pueraria lobata</I> (Willd.) Ohwi, family Leguminosae, commonly known in the West as kudzu. The biological ingredients of puerarin are isoflavone glycosides (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:16:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Puerarin has shown modulatory effects on the inflammation process through inhibitory effects on the production of NO, PGE<SUB>2</SUB> and pro-inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xiao-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiao 2011</LINK>). It has potent antioxidation properties (<LINK REF="REF-Sieveking-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sieveking 2005</LINK>), improves microcirculation (<LINK REF="REF-Tam-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2009</LINK>), has anti-diabetic effects through promoting insulin expression and ameliorating metabolic function (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2013</LINK>), and reduces neuronal injury induced by cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Yin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yin 2015</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:18:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Puerarin is well accepted by Chinese doctors, and it is used widely in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, heart disease and other systemic disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2002</LINK>). Although the treatment and its method of manufacture are widely accepted in China, the constituents of the pharmacological preparations used in the trials cannot be specified precisely. This is in marked contrast to the pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents and their quantities (and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants) are very precisely known, and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of treatments is an inevitable consequence of the nature of Chinese traditional medicine; it is a factor that will contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results. There are reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of puerarin in ischaemic stroke, but whether the existing evidence is scientifically valid and puerarin can be recommended for routine use based on the current evidence is still uncertain. The aim of this review, therefore, is to systematically evaluate evidence from RCTs on puerarin for ischaemic stroke. The previous version of this Cochrane review, which included only one trial with 98 participants, showed no clear effect of puerarin for ischaemic stroke, but the evidence base was too small to draw any reliable conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2008</LINK>). The aim of this update is to include further trials that have been published since we last searched the literature in 2007.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-02-04 14:55:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>People of any age or sex with presumed or definite ischaemic stroke (within 14 days of onset) and of any severity were eligible. We defined ischaemic stroke as either definite (i.e. haemorrhage had been excluded by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) scanning) or possible (i.e. CT or MR scanning had not been performed).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:19:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included trials of puerarin, regardless of duration, dosage or route of administration. The eligible control interventions were placebo or no treatment. We excluded confounded trials in which the treatment or control group received another active therapy (for example pueraria agents versus another drug), but we included trials if the addition of puerarin to another treatment was compared to the other treatment alone and the trial was therefore assessing puerarin.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:04:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In this review, we included 20 trials involving a total of 1574 participants with ischaemic stroke. The time window between stroke onset and randomisation ranged from 4.5 hours to 10 days. Only two trials with 164 participants had the prespecified primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Chao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2007</LINK>); the others only reported short-term neurological impairment outcomes. The risk of primary outcome was 181 per 1000 with puerarin and 241 per 1000 with control (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Limited evidence showed that puerarin was not effective for reducing death or dependency in the long-term (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.36; participants = 164; studies = 2). One trial reported that the mean value of the Barthel Index was lower in the puerarin group; however, participants in this trial were children. Meta-analysis of 16 included trials showed that the proportion of participants with improvement in neurological score at the end of follow-up was significantly higher among those treated with puerarin than in the control group participants.The included trials did not report serious adverse events.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:05:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For the following reasons, the trials had limited usefulness.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The follow-up period ranged from 14 to 30 days after the start of treatment, except in one trial where follow-up lasted for six months. The follow-up time was insufficient to assess the long-term effects. Time taken for spontaneous function recovery of stroke (about two months) is usually shorter than that needed for neurological impairment recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 2000</LINK>); however, the short follow-up in the included trials did not allow an assessment of the intervention's effect on functional recovery.</LI>
<LI>It was remarkable that only six trials reported death, and four of them observed no deaths. The death rate was low both in the intervention and control groups. It was possible that the trials did not include participants who had severe strokes, although the inclusion criteria did not clearly state this, so there is a strong suggestion that the results of the trials were not reported with sufficient rigour.</LI>
<LI>The time window when participants were randomised ranged from 4.5 hours to 10 days, which means that some participants were in the acute phase and some were in the subacute phase. It might well be that the effects of puerarin differ at different phases of stroke.</LI>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-04 16:02:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>According to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE; <A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</A>) approach, the overall quality of the evidence is low due to serious limitations in the design and implementation of the trials (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Detailed information about allocation and blinding were not available in most of the included trials.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-17 16:07:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The methodological rigour of Cochrane Reviews minimises bias in the process of conducting systematic reviews. We are not sure whether there was publication bias as there are only two trials where the primary outcome was included, and so we did not conduct a funnel plot. We cannot obtain the data from one study; however, it is unlikely that the results of the study would have altered our results substantially (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>).</P>

The review showed that puerarin improved neurological deficit significantly more than the control (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.21), which was consistent with our review's findings. However, <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2012</LINK> did not report death or dependency at the end of long-term follow-up.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-22 13:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review did not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of puerarin for the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:27:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review suggests that puerarin may improve neurological impairment after acute ischaemic stroke. However, we judged the included trials to be of poor methodological quality. High quality, large-scale randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute these results. Future trials should overcome the limitations of the trials presented in this review and should clearly report the method of allocation and ensure adequate allocation concealment, including for outcome assessors. Functional outcomes should be used as the primary outcome, not neurological impairment measures, because people who have had a stroke are more concerned with activity. Long-term follow-up should be performed instead of short-term (two to three weeks) follow-up.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:27:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<OL>
<LI>We added 'improvement of neurological deficit at the end of treatment' as one of the secondary outcomes in this review because during the selection of studies, we found most of the included studies used this as an outcome, which we had not considered in the protocol.</LI>
<LI>We also assessed risk of bias by reassessing the risk of bias and adding a 'Summary of finding' table.</LI>
<LI>There was a change to the authors: Bian Liu replaced Yan Tan as the leading author, Deren Wang joined as a new author, Bo Wu was not part of the update team.</LI>
