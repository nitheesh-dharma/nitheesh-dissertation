<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-04 13:55:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Lobeline is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of an Indian tobacco plant (Lobelia inflata). It was synthesised in the early 1900s and classified as a partial nicotinic agonist. The first reported use in aiding smoking cessation was in the 1930s (<LINK REF="STD-Dorsey-1936" TYPE="STUDY">Dorsey 1936</LINK>), Since then it has been tested in a variety of doses and formulations, and has been quite widely used in proprietary smoking remedies.</P>
<P>Schwartz (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1969</LINK>) identified 16 studies or reviews of clinic success rates in which lobeline had been used. Few of these used placebo or other controls, or had follow-up beyond the end of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1972</LINK> also reviewed the evidence and concluded that poor methodological quality prevented any conclusions on efficacy being drawn. In 1993 the FDA banned all OTC smoking cessation products in the United States, including lobeline, due to a lack of acceptable clinical efficacy data (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 1993</LINK>). This led to renewed interest in investigating efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glover-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 1998</LINK>
; Glover 2010).</P>
<P>The early use of high doses (8 mg tablets) of lobeline sulphate gave rise to considerable side effects; Wright (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-1937" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 1937</LINK>) cautioned against the drug's use because of the aversive gastric effects. Parenteral injection although reported as being particularly effective, caused dizziness, nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Ejrup-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Ejrup 1967</LINK>). Even buffered tablets or flavoured pastilles may lead to local throat irritation, with the possibility that any short term efficacy could be due to a non-specific aversive effect.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:44:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>To assess the current evidence for the effectiveness of lobeline in assisting long-term smoking cessation.</P>
<P>The hypothesis tested was that lobeline was more effective than placebo, or an alternative treatment, in achieving long-term smoking cessation.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 14:24:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Tobacco Addiction Review Group Specialized Register of trials, using the free text or indexing term 'lobeline'. The most recent search of the Register was in December 2011, and included reports of trials indexed in MEDLINE to update 20110826, EMBASE to 2011 week 33, PsycINFO to 20110822 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials to Issue 3, 2011. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/frame.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> for details of the search strategies for these databases. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov using the terms lobeline and smoking. Review bibliographies were searched for the original review.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:46:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>In each study the strictest available criteria to define cessation would be used, with figures for sustained abstinence extracted in preference to point prevalence where both were presented. In studies which used biochemical validation of cessation, only those subjects meeting the criteria for biochemically confirmed abstinence would be regarded as having stopped smoking. Subjects in either group lost to follow-up would be regarded as being continuing smokers. Two reviewers would extract data independently. Statistical meta-analysis would be used to derive a typical Odds Ratio and its associated confidence intervals, using a fixed-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No studies were found which met all criteria for inclusion. A number of early reports of the use of lobeline did not use any control groups. Of those which used a placebo, a number employed a cross over design with smoking behaviour assessed over days rather than weeks. Percentage reduction in number of cigarettes smoked was more commonly used as an outcome than complete abstinence. Few trials followed up beyond the end of treatment, and none for the required 6 month period.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Lack of long term follow-up was a reason for exclusion in all cases. A large number of the studies were not controlled. Where comparison was made with a placebo control or alternative treatment it was rarely clear that an appropriate method of randomization had been used.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>On the basis of the trials which have been published in the past sixty years there is no evidence that lobeline has any long term effect on smoking cessation.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 17:37:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Trials with long-term follow-up using validated sustained abstinence are the gold standard for evaluating smoking cessation methods. Trials with short-term follow-up may overestimate both the overall abstinence rates and the size of any treatment effect.</P>
<P>Because short-term abstinence is not necessarily evidence of long-term cessation this review has not systematically synthesized and evaluated the evidence from short-term studies. However even these did not appear to provide consistent evidence that lobeline has an effect on smoking behaviour. A number of the early controlled short term trials concluded that lobeline had no effect on smoking; (<LINK REF="STD-Merry-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Merry 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BTA-1963" TYPE="STUDY">BTA 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1964-A" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1964 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1964-B" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1964 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leone-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Leone 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davison-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Davison 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recent laboratory studies suggested that a formulation of lobeline with better bioavailability could be efficacious (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1996b</LINK>). This research included a pilot study comparing a sublingual lobeline tablet (7.5 mg, 9 times/day) with placebo for 6 weeks. Both groups received weekly individual counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Glover-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 1998</LINK>). This study did not demonstrate short-term efficacy but there was a trend towards a benefit in more dependent participants and results were considered promising enough for a phase 3 trial. A multicentre study of sublingual lobeline sulfate tablets with 750 subjects was conducted by Dynagen in 1997 and identified as unpublished in previous versions of this review. It was published in 2010 (<LINK REF="STD-Glover-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Glover 2010</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in quitting between placebo (15% abstinent) and lobeline (17%) at 6 week follow-up. DynaGen discontinued its research programme, but it remains possible that formulations of lobeline for nasal, transdermal patch or transbuccal patch use may be further investigated by other companies. Since then, other nicotinic receptor partial agonists have been shown to be effective. Varenicline has been licensed widely for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2011</LINK>), whilst cytisine, like lobeline a plant-derived compound, and used as a cessation medication in Eastern Europe, has now shown efficacy in one high quality trial with 12 month follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-West-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:53:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>There are no well conducted trials with long-term follow-up and one large short-term trial did not detect evidence of benefit. There is therefore no evidence that lobeline can aid smoking cessation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-04 17:37:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Given the established efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2008</LINK>) and of partial nicotinic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2011</LINK>), further trials are unlikely unless lobeline is shown to have potential advantages. In this case formulations that increase bioavailability and have good compliance would need to be developed.</P>
