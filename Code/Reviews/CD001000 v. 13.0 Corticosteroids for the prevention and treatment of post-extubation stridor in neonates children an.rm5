I do not agree that it is necessary to change the structure to reflect the different age groups, as the subgroups have not been combined and it is easier for the reader to compare findings across the subgroups in the current figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby, please see if the authors are happy with the revised version for publication.

However one trial using multiple doses of steroids reported ??.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Plain language summary:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stridor is not a more severe form of wheezing; this should be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definition of disease and patient population ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section has gone to considerable length to specify how/why children and adults need to be examined separately; however the last sentence (we chose?) need not appear here, but be reserved for Methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;detrimental effects&amp;#148; could be written as &amp;#147;adverse events&amp;#148;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I am not sure if there are animal studies on this subject, if they exist, their data could be relevant especially because a lot of ventilation related data is available initially from animal models. In case these are not being considered, please mention that only &amp;#8220;studies in humans&amp;#8221; have been considered for this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Missed reference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts RJ, Welch SM, Devlin JW.

Ann Pharmacother 2008 Apr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appropriate selection of any subgroup analysis ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that neonates, children and adults ought to be treated as three separate population groups rather than sub-groups of one population; for the reasons mentioned before.

Excellent update. Thanks very much for all the hard work&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;1.- agree with the change- made a slight change in wording.&lt;br&gt;2- eliminated the sentence on sensitivity anlayis becasue it was not possible with the pediatric and neonatal studies due to so few of them- it was possible with the adult studies and did not really change the results- so we did not include those results in the paper. I think it is clearer to simply leave the sentence out. However, if the reviewers would like a sentence about it in there- then perhaps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sensitivity analysis was planned but unable to be performed on the neonatal and pediatric subgroups due to the few number of studies. Sensitvity analysis on the adult subgroup of patients demonstrated similar results to the overall analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Unfortuantely the Tellez group only reported age as SE, and in fact the data was clearly not normally distributed, so i included a range that i got from contact with one of the authors (T. Deakers)- and left the overall mean-- in reality, it would be better to report a median, but unfortunately the data is not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Agree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. I got 475 with my power calculation using a two sided test. Have changed it to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Ammended a sentence to add cuff leak and some future directions in adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. agree with the table as you have made it. Thank you.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Jan 14th&lt;br&gt;Two Peer reviewers have looked at this. They have picked up the following points:&lt;br&gt;1. The abstract report of a trend for benefit in neonates for re-intubation rates is based on 4 patients in one study, and has a wide confidence interval. I agree that this should not be in the abstract and have removed the following sentence: &amp;quot; there was a non significant trend for prophylactic corticosteroids to decrease re-intubation rates (N=109, RR=0.1, 95% CI 0.01, 1.68)&amp;quot; and amended the sentence in red. Please check you are happy with the amended wording&lt;br&gt;2. Methods of the review: please clarify if sensitivity analysis was possible based on study quality. Final sentence.&lt;br&gt;3. Description of studies: Tellez age of children should give range or mean +/- SD please. (SE is not appropriate here)&lt;br&gt;4. Results: amended in red to clarify that the trend comes from results in a single study. (I have done the same for the discussion).&lt;br&gt;5. Discussion: two tailed test is more appropriate and one peer reviewer has pointed out this would need 435 patients per arm. I have changed this in red but not recalculated the figures.&lt;br&gt;6. Are there recommendations for further studies in adults please (in Implications for further research). Also does the high negative predictive value of cuff-leak test help in identification of high risk patients who may benefit from steroids?&lt;br&gt;7. Finally one peer review suggests the addition of a table to clarify the doses used in each study. I think this could be helpful so if we send the table produced by the peer reviewer could you have a look at it and see if you agree with the contents?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Dec 21st&lt;br&gt;Hi Toby and Robinder,&lt;br&gt;Thanks very much for all the hard work on this review. It is ready for Peer Review in the New Year.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Hi Robinder,&lt;br&gt;I'm afraid that the Cheng data were double-counted in the analyses you sent me. By entering the control group data in different subgroups you introduce dependence in the analyses. This has the effect of making the effect look more certain than it should be, since the assumption of meta-analysis is that observations are drawn from different samples in a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have revised the n/N for Cheng control groups in the attached. I have halved the rates (or got as close to half as I can when dealing with odd numbers). This is the recomended approach when using three arms of data from one study in a meta-analysis. You may need to revise the results accordingly. The test for interaction is in the excel spreadsheet attached to this email. You enter the subgroup data for the two groups and you can derive your estimate of the difference in risk ratios from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC recheck Dec 12&lt;br&gt;I think the post hoc subgroup analysis is sensible and not over played, but have added &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; to no difference in a couple of places, and changed the analysis to a proper test of interaction by entering both sets of subgroups. I am happy with the statistical calculations but please check with authors too.&lt;br&gt;Can we find a suitable peer reviewer as again this is a substantive update in my book.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When analyzed together using a random effects model, there was no significant difference in re-intubation rate between treatment initiated 6 hours or more before extubation compared to those who started treatment closer to extubation, (RRR = 0.41 95% CI 0.08, 3.06) nor in post extubation stridor (RRR =0.45 95% CI 0.18,1.12). Five studies utilized multiple doses of corticosteroids either before or after extubation (same as above studies, plus Couser 1992 where treatment was started about 4 hours before extubation). Together, these studies again demonstrated no significant change in re-intubation rate compared to studies with single treatment (RRR = 0.28 95% CI 0.05, 1.47) but a significant reduction in post extubation stridor was found compared to a single treatment (RRR =0.33 95% CI 0.15,0.76). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;=============================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;Date: Nov 27&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine. Did all the authors' contribute to the update?&lt;br&gt;What's new&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Amended to include the names of the two new trials&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;ACTION: No change&lt;br&gt;References&lt;br&gt;ACTION: checked by Liz&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION: What was the placebo for Francois 2007 please. Could the authors add some data about allocation concealment and blinding in the first box. It would also be helpful to have a note of the number of patients included in the second box for each study.&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: fine&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Minor changes in red&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Ok&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Random modelling was presumably specified in the protocol but heterogeneity is large in this review and still deserves to be investigated. Fixed effects models (which may relate more to whether the treatment can work under any circumstances) show significant benefits. This is explored in the discussion, but do you want to mention the results of fixed effects?&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: See above and contentious issues below.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: It is interesting to me that the 3 older studies in adults administered corticosteroids one hour before extubation. The two newer ones over 24 and 12 hours before. The latter show significant benefit. This may not necessarily be the reason for the difference between the two new studies and the older ones but it may be relevant. This difference is also seen in the neonatal studies. What about the results from the two active arms of the Cheng study. This is not currently mentioned? There is also support from the CLV reports in this study for an onset of benefit around 6 hours - this is relevant to the exploration of heterogeneity and might even justify a post-hoc sub-group exploration of treatment 6 hours or more before extubation compared with just before? What do you think?&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION:&lt;br&gt;Next action - Back to authors for consideration of the above please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 14:02:49 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="CCS-OTH" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="13.0">

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Findings of review changed with addition of new study and assessment of different dosing strategies in adult studies. Lee 2007 employed multiple doses of dexamethasone begun 24 hours prior to extubation in adults who had a cuff leak volume &lt;110 ml. The authors demonstrated no difference in re-intubation rates between treatment and placebo groups, but a significant reduction in post extubation stridor for the treatment group. When combined with the other studies, the overall results of the meta analysis show non-significant trends towards reduction in reintubation and a significant reduction in stridor for adults, although the studies were very heterogeneous. Post-hoc subgroup analyses suggest that multiple doses started 12-24 hours before extubation in "high risk" adults are beneficial in reducing post extubation stridor, and there is a trend towards reduction in reintubation. There have been no additional studies for neonates or children.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-08 11:08:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>When people in intensive care need assistance breathing, they may need to have a breathing tube inserted down through their windpipe (trachea or airway - the passage to the lungs). After it is taken out (extubation), the airways can be swollen (inflamed). This swelling can make it hard to breathe, cause stridor (noisy breathing), and the tube may need to be replaced. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that might reduce this swelling. The review of 11 trials involving 2301 people found that using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not been proven overall effective for babies or children, but this intervention does merit further study particularly for those at high risk to fail extubation. For high risk adults, multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12-24 hours before extubation appear to be helpful.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-08 10:50:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Post-extubation stridor may prolong length of stay in the intensive care unit, particularly if airway obstruction is severe and re-intubation proves necessary. Some clinicians use corticosteroids to prevent or treat post-extubation stridor, but corticosteroids may be associated with adverse effects ranging from hypertension to hyperglycaemia, so a systematic assessment of the efficacy of this therapy is indicated.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 20:06:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven trials involving 2301 people were included: six in adults, two in neonates, three in children. All but one examined use of steroids for the prevention of post-extubation stridor; the remaining one concerned treatment of existing post-extubation stridor in children. Patients were drawn from heterogeneous medical/surgical populations. Dexamethasone given intravenously at least once prior to extubation was the most common steroid regimen utilized (uniformly in neonates and children). In neonates the two studies found heterogeneous results, with no overall statistically significant reduction in post extubation stridor (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.32). One of these studies was on high-risk patients treated with multiple doses of steroids around the time of extubation, and this study showed a significant reduction in stridor. In children, the two studies were clinically heterogeneous. One study included children with underlying airway abnormalities and the other excluded this group. Prophylactic corticosteroids tended to reduce reintubation and significantly reduced post-extubation stridor in the study that included children with underlying airway abnormalities (N = 62) but not in the study that excluded these children (N = 153). In six adult studies (total N = 1953), the use of prophylactic corticosteroid administration did not significantly reduce the risk of re-intubation (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22). While there was a significant reduction in the incidence of post extubation stridor (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99), there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=81%, X<SUP>2</SUP>=26.36, df=5, p&lt;0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed that post extubation stridor could be reduced in adults with a high likelihood of post extubation stridor when corticosteroids were administered as multiple doses begun 12-24 hours prior to extubation compared to single doses closer to extubation; the test for interaction for multiple versus single doses indicated RRR 0.22 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.47) for stridor with multiple doses. Side effects were uncommon and could not be aggregated.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-22 09:46:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not proven effective for neonates or children. However, given the consistent trends towards benefit, this intervention does merit further study, particularly for high risk children or neonates. In adults, multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12-24 hours prior to extubation do appear beneficial for patients with a high likelihood of post extubation stridor.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:03:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endotracheal intubation, although vital to facilitate mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and operating room, is associated with the potential development of glottic or sub glottic edema, resulting in stridor upon extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Koka-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koka 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1992</LINK>). Such extra-thoracic airway obstruction following endotracheal intubation may occur in up to 37% of critically ill paediatric patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kemper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemper 1991</LINK>). Either extrapolating from studies assessing their role in the treatment of laryngotracheobronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Kairys-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kairys 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Super-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Super 1989</LINK>), or based upon early anecdotal reports of postoperative patients (<LINK REF="REF-Deming-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deming 1961</LINK>), some clinicians administer corticosteroids in varying ways to intubated patients prior to extubation, in an effort to avoid the development of post-extubation stridor. Others use steroids to treat patients who develop stridor following extubation. On the assumption that reactive edema develops in the glottic or subglottic mucosa due to pressure or irritation from the endotracheal tube, steroids may offer protection or treatment by virtue of their anti-inflammatory actions.</P>
<P>Post-extubation stridor may prolong length of stay in the intensive care unit, particularly if airway obstruction is severe and re-intubation proves necessary. Corticosteroids, however, may be associated with adverse effects ranging from hypertension to hyperglycemia, and a more systematic assessment of the efficacy of this therapy is indicated prior to widespread adoption of this practice (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Differences between neonates, children, and adults with regard to airway anatomy and management are sufficient to warrant separate evaluation of these groups. In children, the narrowest portion of the airway is at the level of the cricoid cartilage, compared to the vocal cords in adults. For this reason, cuffed endotracheal tubes are used less commonly in infants and children, as a natural seal is formed between the tube and the trachea at the level of the cricoid. Edema related to the presence of a tight-fitting endotracheal tube in infants and children is therefore more likely to develop in the subglottic region, while in adults, laryngeal edema is more likely. Finally, due to the absolute size differences between ages, a small amount of edema in an infant represents much more significant infringement of the cross-sectional area of the airway (area is a function of the square of the radius), causing more severe airflow limitation and possible symptoms. For these reasons, we chose, a priori, to examine these three populations separately.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any comparison of the administration of parenteral corticosteroids (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), inhalation; any number of doses) versus placebo in the 24 hour period prior to and following the elective extubation of patients.

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure assessed was the need for re-intubation of the trachea due to severe stridor and airway obstruction. Trials that failed to distinguish re-intubation due to airway obstruction as evidenced by stridor or laryngeal edema from that due to other causes were not included. A secondary endpoint was the presence of stridor within six hours following extubation. Croup scores (<LINK REF="REF-Backofen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backofen 1987</LINK>) and treatment with nebulized vasoconstrictor therapy were also examined if data were available. The incidence of the following complications was examined: hypertension, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding.</P>

<P>In the two neonatal studies, the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> showed a trend towards reduced rate of re-intubation with prophylactic intervention, but no infants in either group of the patients studied by <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> were re-intubated. The trials together demonstrated no significant difference in stridor incidence with intervention in 109 patients (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.32), although the "high-risk" patients, with traumatic or multiple intubations in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> had a lower incidence of stridor when treated with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was heterogeneity in both outcomes between studies, suggesting that the multiple dose strategy in the higher risk patients of the <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK> study may be more effective than the single dose regimen in lower risk patients of the <LINK REF="STD-Ferrara-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrara 1989</LINK> trial. Other outcome measures sought, such as number of vasoconstrictor treatments or croup scores were not reported in these studies.</P>
<P>The two pediatric trials were quite heterogeneous, with conflicting results. The study that included patients with underlying airway anomalies (<LINK REF="STD-Anene-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anene 1996</LINK>) showed a reduction in reintubation, although not statistically significant (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.001 to 1.15), while the study that excluded such patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tellez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tellez 1991</LINK>), in fact showed a higher incidence of reintubation in the treatment group (RR 2.28; 95% CI 0.73 to 7.09), although again not statistically significant (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There was a reduction in post-extubation stridor with intervention in 216 patients (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.97), although the studies were too heterogeneous to reliably interpret the significance of the estimate of relative risk (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 53%, X<SUP>2 </SUP>= 2.13, df=1, P = 0.14). A trend towards a reduction in vasoconstrictor use for post-extubation stridor was observed in these studies (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.1 to 1.43, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analysis of the six adult studies demonstrates a non-significant trend for reduction in re-intubation rates with prophylactic steroid administration (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22) and a reduction in post-extubation stridor (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Post hoc subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Given the level of statistical heterogeneity observed between the six adult studies, a subgroup analysis was preformed to explore possible reasons for variation in effect size between the studies. We tested whether there was a difference between the risk of reintubation and stridor between regimens employing multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12-24 hours prior to extubation with regimens using a single dose administered closer to extubation. Three studies employed a multiple dosing strategy. Since this post-hoc analysis is intended to specifically compare the risk for those given multiple doses of corticosteroids to those with single doses of corticosteroids we employed a test of interaction using the method described by <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>, in order to generate a Ratio of Relative Risks (RRR). There was no statistically significant difference between the relative risks between the two subgroups of studies for re-intubation (RRR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.04). However, there was a statistically significant reduction in post extubation stridor favouring the multiple dosing strategies (RRR 0.23 95% CI 0.11 to 0.48). Within subgroup I<SUP>2</SUP> measurements were low for both outcomes (re-intubation: 22% and 0%; stridor: 25% and 0% for multiple and single dosing strategies respectively). <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> display the relative risks (RR) for each of the two subgroups of treatment regimens compared to placebo. The ratio of relative risk (RRR) described above directly compares the relative risk of reintubation or post extubation stridor for those given multiple doses of corticosteroids 12-24 hours prior to extubation, to those given single doses closer to extubation.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 20:25:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Systemic corticosteroids have been advocated to either prevent or treat post extubation stridor in intensive care unit patients. This systematic review does not support routine steroid use for prevention of re-intubation due to upper airway obstruction or post extubation stridor in children or neonates. However corticosteroids may be beneficial in reducing post extubation stridor if employed in a multiple dose strategy 12-24 hours prior to extubation for certain high risk adults.</P>
<P>From two trials of preventative dexamethasone therapy in neonates, post extubation stridor was reduced. However, there was heterogeneity between these two studies, and benefit appeared to be confined to higher risk patients receiving multiple doses of dexamethasone around the time of extubation.</P>
<P>A previous Cochrane Review examined the role of steroids given to neonates prior to elective extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2001</LINK>). The primary outcome was the rate of re-intubation from all causes. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1992</LINK> was included in that review. We excluded this trial because it failed to distinguish re-intubation due to airway obstruction from that of other causes. With this study included in their review, Davis did find that dexamethasone prior to extubation reduced the risk of endotracheal re-intubation (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.97). Like us, however, they concluded that dexamethasone is indicated for elective extubation of "high risk" neonates on the same grounds as us - namely that a clear benefit of dexamethasone was seen only in the "high risk" patients studied by <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1992</LINK>.</P>
<P>The two pediatric studies that examined elective dexamethasone treatment prior to extubation showed similar efficacy in preventing stridor but differed in terms of the effect on re-intubation rates. This may be in part due to the high rate of stridor and re-intubation in the control group of <LINK REF="STD-Anene-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anene 1996</LINK>; seven of 32 control patients required re-intubation and 22 of 28 still had stridor six hours following extubation. This suggests that Anene's population was at higher risk, although this is only subtly suggested in the description of included and excluded patients. <LINK REF="STD-Anene-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anene 1996</LINK> included patients with multiple airway manipulations (for example, re-intubation), while <LINK REF="STD-Tellez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tellez 1991</LINK> excluded such patients. Analogous to the neonatal studies, it appears that dexamethasone only confers benefit on "high risk" children, e.g. those with additional airway instrumentation.</P>
<P>The neonatal and pediatric studies contained relatively few patients, and despite the use of meta-analysis, the apparent lack of a statistically significant effect of steroids on re-intubation rates may be due to insufficient sample sizes. Assuming a reduction in re-intubation rates from 10% to 5%, a two-tailed alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2, 475 patients per arm would be required in a prospective trial sufficiently powered to detect such a difference.</P>
<P>The three most recent trials of corticosteroids in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Francois 2007</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) show that corticosteroids are beneficial in preventing post extubation stridor, and contradict results from the three previous adult studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gaussorgues-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gaussorgues 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darmon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Darmon 1992</LINK>). The reported incidence of stridor in the control group was remarkably different in each of the six adults studies (1.45%, 9.1%, 22%, 26.3%, 27.5% 30.2%). The 30.2% reported by <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK> and the 27.5% of <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> certainly overestimate the overall risk of post extubation stridor, as these were high-risk populations with a low cuff leak volume percentage. While the predictive ability of cuff leak volume is quite variable throughout the literature (<LINK REF="REF-DeBast-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBast 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996</LINK>), the incidence of post extubation stridor was quite low for patients who did not meet cuff leak criteria in both the <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK> (2.6%) and <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> (4.9%) studies. <LINK REF="STD-Francois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Francois 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ho-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1996</LINK> also report a relatively high incidence of post extubation stridor (22% and 26.3% respectively), although inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Gaussorgues-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gaussorgues 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Darmon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Darmon 1992</LINK>, which had relatively low incidence of post extubation stridor. Nonethless, the three trials demonstrating benefit have been performed in populations with relatively high incidence of stridor. In addition, these trials employed regimens using multiple doses of corticosteroids begun 12-24 hours prior to extubation. As such, one can speculate that the more recent trials have shown benefit for corticosteroids because the dosing regimen may be more effective and is targeted towards a population with a higher incidence of post extubation stridor. A recently published meta analysis incorporating these same six adult studies echo these conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2008</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Interestingly the sole study to utilize two treatment arms- single versus multiple dose methylprednisolone begun 24 hours prior to extubation (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>) demonstrated no significant difference for rates of reintubation (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.33) or post extubation stridor (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.16 to 2.41) between treatment arms, but both interventions in this single study were significantly better than placebo. While this may argue that timing of corticosteroid administration may play the largest role, it is still possible that the benefits of corticosteroids for the prevention of post extubation stridor stem from either repeated doses of corticosteroids, or administration 12-24 hours prior to planned extubation.</P>
<P>The implications that steroids may confer the most benefit for patients who have undergone additional airway manipulations - does not appear to hold true for patients who have already failed extubation due to post-extubation stridor, although conclusions are difficult to draw from the one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Harel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Harel 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>In children, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prophylactic intervention with corticosteroids prior to elective extubation reduces the incidence of re-intubation due to airway obstruction or post-extubation stridor. In neonates, trends towards reduced rates of re-intubation or stridor could be demonstrated only in high-risk patients. In adults, single doses of corticosteroids do not appear to prevent re-intubation due to airway obstruction or post extubation stridor. However, compared to single doses, there is a trend towards reduced rates of reintubation and a reduction in post extubation stridor when multiple doses of corticosteroids are started 12-24 hours prior to extubation, particularly for cohorts with a high incidence of post extubation stridor. The evidence to suggest that steroid therapy can reduce re-intubation rates in children already re-intubated once for post-extubation stridor is lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-03-23 10:44:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Additional study is warranted to prospectively identify high-risk patients who might benefit from prophylactic steroid administration prior to extubation, and future trials in children or neonates should explore a multiple dose strategy, begun at least 12 hours prior to extubation. However, evidence does not support routine use of corticosteroids in infants or children who are not otherwise high risk. For adults, cuff leak volume has been used to identify "higher risk" patients, with mixed results. However, additional study is warranted to determine whether this adequately identifies higher risk patients and if regimens that utilize repeated doses of corticosteroids initiated at least 12 hours prior to extubation improve outcome in populations where the incidence of post extubation stridor is high.</P>

<P>The conclusion of this review does not clarify that administering multiple doses of corticosteroid has a beneficial effect on development of stridor, as compared to a single dose (post-hoc analysis). Analyzing only those trials that used multiple doses of corticosteroid starting at least 12 hours prior to extubation shows that there is a clear beneficial effect on risk of reintubation ((RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.47, 3 trials with 906 participants, I2 = 15.9%), and development of stridor (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.12-0.30, 3 trials with 906 participants, I2 = 47.9%). The respective numbers needed to treat (NNT) are 20 (95% CI 14-50) and 5 (95% CI 4-7). These three trials were in adult patients; two were included in the review while the third was published after the search date in the review (Lee CH, Peng MJ, Wu CL. Dexamethasone to prevent postextubation airway obstruction in adults: a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Crit Care 2007;11:R72.). There were no similar trials in neonates and children. Therefore, current evidence shows that multiple doses of parenteral corticosteroids are beneficial when started at least 12 hours prior to extubation. Future paediatric and neonatal trials ought to be conducted with this administration protocol because it may not be appropriate to extrapolate data from adults to children, considering that airway geometry and site of post-extubation upper airway obstruction are different in them.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-03-26 16:52:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this comment, we have performed a substantive update of the review to incorporate all new studies. While two new studies were identified, only one was included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) because the <LINK REF="STD-Shih" TYPE="STUDY">Shih</LINK> study was published in only abstract form, and the authors could not be contacted. Three trials in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Francois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Francois 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) have included intervention arms with multiple doses of corticosteroids, begun a minimum of 12 hours prior to extubation. Both the <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK> study and the <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> study have included only a subset of patients (who meet cuff leak volume criteria). In addition, the <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK> study had three arms, with only 63 patients (of the 128 randomised) receiving multiple doses of corticosteroids or placebo, begun 24 hours prior to extubation.</P>
<P>Moreover, because this subgroup analysis is post-hoc, we felt it important to directly compare the estimates of relative risk derived from multiple dose regimens to those of single dose regimens, rather than simply limiting our analysis to trials which utilized multiple doses. Using the methods of Altman and Bland, we have performed a test of interaction, and reported ratios of relative risks. It appears that for adults, multiple doses of corticosteroids administered 12-24 hours prior to extubation are more beneficial to prevent post extubation stridor than regimens employing single doses closer to extubation (RRR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.48). Multiple dose regimens did not demonstrate a significant advantage over single dose regimens for reintubation, although trends for benefit are seen (RRR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.04).</P>
<P>However, in addition to differences in dosing regimens, the three trials demonstrating benefit for corticosteroids had high incidence of post extubation stridor. Two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) only included patients who met cuff leak volume criteria, and as such may be &#8220;higher risk.&#8221; In fact, these two studies had the highest incidence of post-extubation stridor in the control group (27.5% in <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>, and 30.2% in <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>) compared to the other adult studies. For the non-intervention arm of both of these studies (patients who did not meet the cuff leak volume criteria), the incidence of postextubation stridor was quite low (4.9% in <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>, 2.6% in <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2006</LINK>). Such information on cuff-leak volume was not available from the <LINK REF="STD-Francois-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Francois 2007</LINK> study, although the incidence of post-extubation stridor was 22%, higher than many previously reported adult studies. Therefore, this therapy may show the most benefit for patients who meet certain high risk criteria.</P>
<P>There have been no significant additions to the paediatric or neonatal literature on this topic, and as such generalizing this information to these groups is not warranted. However, we would agree that future trials in children or neonates should explore a multiple-dose strategy, begun at least 12 hours prior to extubation.</P>
