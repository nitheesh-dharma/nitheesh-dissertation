<P>This summay of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of post-operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty. The review shows that in people with RA:</P>
<P>- there was not enough information in the included study to tell whether wearing a hand splint and performing exercises (continuous passive motion) after surgery improves hand function, relieves pain, or corrects deformity.</P>
<P>We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible complications of knuckle joint replacement may include infection, changes to the bones around the implant, or the chance that the implant could break and cause problems to the hand.

<B>What is RA and what is post-operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty?</B>
</P>
<P>In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. the small joints of your hands are usually affected first. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty with implants, which is the replacement of painful knuckle joints with artificial knuckle joints, has been performed for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1960s. The surgery is done because RA can cause damage of the knuckle joints making them unable to straighten out (flexion deformity) and causing them to lean over toward the small finger (flexion or ulnar deviation deformity). For eight to 12 weeks following surgery, patients wear hand splints and perform exercises to maintain and increase motion in the healing hand. Post-operative therapy regimes share common aims of encouraging MCP flexion and extension without the recurrence of flexion or ulnar deviation deformity. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of post-operative therapy regimes for increasing hand function after MCP arthroplasty in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to August 2006), EMBASE (January 1993 to August 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2006), Digital Dissertations (January 1960 to August 2006), DARE (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 3), Current Contents Connect (January 1998 to August 2006), and AMED (January 1985 to August 2006) were searched for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials using rheumatoid arthritis and hand as the search terms. The bibliographies of all trials identified by this strategy were also searched and primary authors were contacted for unpublished data and also clarification regarding study protocols. </P>
<P>We performed handsearches of all relevant society conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles. No language limits were applied, although searches were only relevant after the 1950s when MCP arthroplasty began to be performed.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were accepted if they evaluated the efficacy of a post-operative therapy regime for MCP arthroplasty.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>No data analyses were performed as only one controlled clinical trial was found. The data from that study are described.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Our search only identified one controlled clinical trial involving 22 participants. The majority of the evidence for various splinting and exercise regimes consisted of case series and case studies. Results from the one (poor quality) trial suggest that the use of continuous passive motion is not effective in increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Well-designed randomised controlled trials which compare the efficacy of different therapeutic splinting programmes following MCP arthroplasty are required. At this time, the results of one study (silver level evidence) suggest that continuous passive motion alone is not recommended for increasing motion or strength after MCP arthroplasty.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-08 21:08:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease which causes damage to many parts of the body. It has been estimated that over 90% of RA patients have some involvement of their hand joints (<LINK REF="REF-Dellhag-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellhag 1995</LINK>), often to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or knuckle joints (<LINK REF="REF-Stirrat-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stirrat 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Synovial joints, which are comprised of a joint capsule lined with synovial membrane and containing synovial fluid for nutrition and lubrication of the joint, are affected by RA. The diseased synovium becomes swollen and the distended joint capsule and ligaments become stretched and weakened. Metacarpophalangeal joints are synovial joints. Their stability is reduced in RA whilst the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles to the fingers continue to pull across them. Further joint inflammation causes cartilage and bone erosion. There is some debate as to the exact process of MCP joint deformity in RA (<LINK REF="REF-Stirrat-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stirrat 1996</LINK>) but it results in the proximal phalanges of the fingers dislocating in a volar and ulnar direction. The extensor tendons become stretched and damaged and mechanically ineffective at extending the MCP joint. The result for the patient is having his or her hand unable to open fully and having it appear deformed, while often being painful. Patients are unable to open their hand wide, for example to hold a coffee cup, or to put their hand in their pocket. </P>
<P>The MCP joint is critical to the placement of the fingers during activity. The muscles that flex, extend, adduct and abduct the digits are not able to act correctly when the MCP joint is unstable or deformed (<LINK REF="REF-Stirrat-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stirrat 1996</LINK>). Instability and pain diminishes hand function so much that surgical reconstruction is often attempted.</P>
<P>Hand function is a predictor of independence in those with rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Dellhag-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellhag 1995</LINK>) and over one quarter of RA surgery is performed upon the hand (<LINK REF="REF-Altissimi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altissimi 1989</LINK>). Although it is suggested that recent pharmaceutical interventions decrease the need for hand surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Ghattas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghattas 2005</LINK>), this has not yet been established.</P>
<P>In most cases the deteriorated MCP joint is removed and replaced by a prosthesis. There are a number of designs available but all possess the ability to flex and extend (<LINK REF="REF-Beevers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beevers 1995</LINK>). They also aim to reduce pain, by removing the diseased MCP joint and surrounding soft tissues, and to increase stability of the joint so that the patient's own muscles can act naturally upon the joint whilst the finger stays aligned with the hand.</P>
<P>Once the prosthesis, or prostheses if multiple MCP joints are reconstructed, is implanted a capsule forms around the implant. During this phase of healing, positioning and controlled motion of the joint is considered crucial to forming a basis for ongoing stability and motion. A number of approaches to post-operative healing are documented but most involve stabilising the wrist whilst allowing guided flexion and assisted extension of the MCP joints (<LINK REF="REF-Madden-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 1977</LINK>). It is not clear which regime provides best functional results following MCP arthroplasty. The post-operative regimes vary in the way that the hand is splinted and the exercise routine. The two most common regimes use (1) static splints which have no moving parts, with the MCP joints in extension or alternating between extension and flexion, removed for active range of motion exercises, (2) dynamic MCP extension splinting, which hold the MCP joints suspended in extension with the use of rubber bands, where the patient performs extension and flexion exercises in the splint. Therapy regimes are not only variable but time consuming and expensive, therefore searching for evidence of the efficacy of post-operative therapy regimes is warranted.</P>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of post-operative treatment regimes for MCP arthroplasty in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. </P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies whose primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a hand therapy regime for increasing hand function after MCP arthroplasty were considered for inclusion.<BR/>Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were considered for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The original published protocol for this review included cohort and cross-sectional studies, observational studies, and case series, but these were not included in the review in accordance with Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group methods.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included all participants who had MCP arthroplasty. We also included those who underwent additional surgery (for example cross intrinsic transfer, thumb arthroplasty, or interphalangeal joint fusion) at the time of MCP arthroplasty and those with additional hand deformities or who had undergone prior surgery.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All non-surgical treatments were considered, including splinting, exercises, oedema control, activity modification, scar management, and continuous passive motion, with any combination for any length of treatment. Any interventions, alone or in combination, compared against each other or against no intervention were included if they were described in detail sufficient for reproduction.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary goals of MCP arthroplasty and post-operative therapy include improvement of hand function, relief of pain, and correction of deformity. The primary outcomes reflect measures of impairment such as range of motion (ROM), grip and pinch strength, and joint stability. All range of motion outcomes of the included study were reported.</P>

<P>SEARCH STRATEGY (MEDLINE) in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>Two review authors (NMW, MJ) independently selected the trials to be included in the review. First, each author reviewed titles and abstracts of trials identified from the search. The second review author (MJ) was blinded with regard to authors, institution and journal of the trials. Next, each review author obtained the full text of studies of possible relevance for independent assessment.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality assessment</B>
<BR/>The quality of included trials was assessed with particular emphasis on the three components of the validated Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) (randomisation, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, description of withdrawals and dropouts) and on allocation concealment, explicit diagnostic criteria, explicit outcome criteria, and baseline differences in experimental groups. Based on methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration, two review authors assessed whether each quality assessment item was met, unmet, or unclear, and derived an overall assessment of the validity of the results of individual studies by assigning one of three categories. These were: low, moderate, or high risk of bias; corresponding to all criteria met, one or more criteria partially met, and one or more criteria not met, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, allocation concealment was ranked as: A: adequate, B: unclear, C: inadequate, or D: not used. The review authors assessed the methodological quality and other trial information on a pre-piloted data extraction sheet and transposed the information into the table of Characteristics of included studies. The two review authors graded the methodological quality of the included study without disagreement. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data was independently extracted by two review authors (NMW and MJ) using a structured sheet. Data extracted included the study design, patient selection methods, patient characteristics, surgical and post-surgical treatment, attrition of patients, MCP range of motion, and comparison of outcomes between patient groups.</P>
<P>In order to assess efficacy, raw data for outcomes of interest (means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for dichotomous outcomes) were extracted where available in the published reports. Had the reported data been converted or imputed, this would have been recorded in the notes section of the table of Characteristics of included studies. </P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2005</LINK>) was to be used for the statistical analysis. Results were planned to be expressed as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. We had planned to report the absolute and relative change from baseline for each of the outcome measures (expressed as percent change). The different intervention types were to be analysed separately. The results of comparable trials were to be pooled to provide a point estimate of the effect of post-operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty. To expedite rapid and easier updating of the review we reported all results that could be extracted from the included trial. Included studies were to be assessed for clinical homogeneity with respect to the duration of the disorder, control group and outcomes. </P>
<P>Originally we had planned sensitivity analyses on the following subgroups. <BR/>1. Methodological quality of trials.<BR/>2. Involvement of other parts of the upper limbs and severity of RA hand symptoms and signs in participants.<BR/>3. Separate interventions (including proximal interphalangeal joint fusion, thumb, cross intrinsic transfer).<BR/>4. Length of time of follow up. The length of time after surgery when patients were assessed is important. Ideally studies report assessment after patients are discharged from therapy and then at another later time period (e.g. at six months). Long-term studies show that the improvement in hand function after MCP arthroplasty with implants deteriorates over the following years, due to implant wear and fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Goldfarb-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldfarb 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Clinical relevance tables</B>
<BR/>Clinical relevance tables were planned to improve the readability of the review. For primary dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) would be determined. Weighted absolute risk difference would be calculated using the risk difference statistic. RR-1 would calculate the weighted relative per cent change (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). The number needed to treat (NNT) would be calculated from the control group event rate (unless the population event rate was known) and the relative risk. For primary continuous outcomes, weighted absolute change would be calculated from the weighted mean difference, if trials using the same scale were pooled. For outcomes pooled on different scales, the standardised mean difference would be multiplied by the baseline standard deviation in the control group to obtain the weighted absolute change. Relative per cent change from baseline would be calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group.</P>
<P>
<B>Grading the strength of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group common system of grading the strength of scientific evidence for a therapeutic agent (described further in <LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>) was used to rank the evidence included in this systematic review. Four categories are used to rank the evidence from research studies from highest to lowest quality: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. </P>
<P>Platinum: a published systematic review that has at least two individual controlled trials, each satisfying the following. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. </LI>
<LI>Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. </LI>
<LI>Handling of withdrawals with &gt; 80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as last observation carried forward (LOCF) are acceptable). </LI>
<LI>Concealment of treatment allocation. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Gold: at least one randomised clinical trial meeting all of the following criteria for the major outcome(s), as reported.<BR/>
</P>

<BR/>Silver: a systematic review or randomised trial that does not meet the above criteria. Silver ranking would also include evidence from at least one study of non-randomised cohorts that did and did not receive the therapy, or evidence from at least one high quality case-control study. A randomised trial with a 'head-to-head' comparison of agents would be considered silver ranking unless a reference were provided to a comparison of one of the agents to placebo showing at least a 20% relative difference. </P>
<P>Bronze: the bronze ranking is given to evidence if at least one high quality case series without controls (including simple before and after studies in which patients act as their own control) or if the conclusion is derived from expert opinion based on clinical experience without reference to any of the foregoing (for example, argument from physiology, bench research, or first principles). </P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>One hundred and forty-one studies were identified by the search strategy, 135 of these pertained to the implant and surgical procedure only. Six of the studies described the effect of post-operative therapy specifically. The authors of two identified papers (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Groth-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Groth 1996</LINK>) were contacted to determine whether additional details were available. Additional details were not available for either study. Five studies that described the use of a post-MCP arthroplasty therapy regime (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0026_-Pratt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burr &amp; Pratt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burr-_x0026_-Pratt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Burr &amp; Pratt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gribben-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gribben 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groth-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Groth 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 2003</LINK>) were excluded from this review because they did not provide a group of patients which could be used for comparison or they were retrospective in design, or both. Only one study was of controlled clinical trials (CCT) design and thus met the criteria for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were 13 women and nine men, their average age was 58 years. They had been diagnosed with RA between seven and 25 years before participating in this study. This study of 22 patients compared the use of a dynamic MCP extension splint combined with exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Madden-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 1977</LINK>) and continuous passive motion for the MCP joint after MCP arthroplasty (10 hands) with the dynamic MCP extension splint combined with exercises alone (15 hands). Continuous passive motion for the MCP joint involves strapping the hand and fingers into a battery-operated or electrical device which mechanically opens and closes the fingers whenever it is turned on. It is meant to help the healing tissues to maintain enough length for opening and closing the hand.</P>
<P>The outcome measures made by an independent observer included MCP range of motion and flexion, extension and ulnar deviation using a goniometer, which is a device like a protractor that measures joint angles. It was not stated whether this was active or passive. Also measured were grip strength using a dynamometer, a device which measures force placed on its handles when it is squeezed, and lateral pinch strength (force between the thumb and the side of the index finger) with an unspecified measuring device. Patients were measured pre-operatively and six months post-operatively. The pre-operative grip strength data were incomplete for two participants.</P>

<P>The study by Ring et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK>) may have suffered selection bias by using alternate allocation methods rather than random, concealed allocation. The study was also considered to have potential for performance bias because the patients may have received continuous passive motion (CPM) of different durations and frequencies. The authors state that the machine was worn as much as tolerated by the patients in the first six post-operative weeks. Furthermore, the study had limitations in the analysis of outcomes; the unit of allocation to treatment was the hand but the unit of analysis was the individual finger, without a correction for the cluster design (that is no measure of the intracluster correlation coefficient). Due to potential bias in patient selection and delivery of treatment, the study was deemed to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The study is described further in the table of Characteristics of included studies.</P>

</I>
</B>Ring et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK>) did not present data in a form suitable for meta-analysis. The estimates of variance in the trial were not correct and could not be verified.</P>
<P>Pre-operatively the control group had a mean of 25 degrees of MCP motion (range 0 to 70 degrees). Normally the range would be from 0 degrees (fully straight) to about 80 degrees (fully bent). Pre-operatively the treatment group had a mean of 34 degrees of MCP motion (range 10 to 70 degrees). Pre-operatively the control group had a mean of 45 degrees of ulnar deviation at the MCP joint (range 10 to 85 degrees). Normally there would be 0 degrees, in other words, looking from above, the finger would line up with the hand when fully straight. Pre-operatively the treatment group had a mean of 34 degrees of ulnar deviation at the MCP joint (range 10 to 70 degrees). </P>
<P>Six months post-operatively, the treatment group had a mean of 39 degrees of motion in the MCP joint (mean of 5 degrees improvement) and the control group had a mean arc of 47 degrees of motion in the MCP joint (mean of 22 degrees improvement). At this time the treatment group had a residual 12 degrees ulnar deviation in the MCP joint (mean of 31 degrees improvement) and the control group had a residual 5 degrees ulnar deviation in the MCP joint (mean of 40 degrees improvement). </P>
<P>Pre-operatively the control group had 3.8 kg of grip (13 of 15 hands were measured) and 1.5 kg of pinch (9 of 15 hands were measured); and post-operatively they had 3.7 kg grip and 1.1 kg of pinch. Pre-operatively the treatment group had 3.2 kg of grip (all hands were measured) and 1.6 kg of pinch (7 of 10 hands were measured); and post-operatively they had 2.3 kg and 2.7 kg respectively. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>With data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK>), no recommendation can be made from this review in regard to the use of post-operative continuous passive motion (CPM). Sufficient data is not available to recommend or refute the use of CPM following MCP arthroplasty.</P>
<P>This review is inconclusive regarding the efficacy of splinting and exercise regimes for MCP arthroplasty as both the intervention and control groups received splinting and exercise in the only included study (<LINK REF="STD-Ring-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations of the review</B>
<BR/>Only one study was found that offered a comparison group which underwent a different post-operative regime. There were over 60 studies that briefly described the results of inserting various implants as well as using various post-operative therapy regimes. They are not included as they do not specifically evaluate the efficacy of the therapy regimes.</P>
<P>MCP arthroplasty is a relatively uncommon procedure and not does contribute significant numbers to any one facility. The small number of patients who undergo MCP arthroplasty and their diverse disease pattern means that identifying a control or comparison group is a challenge. Several authors of the excluded studies noted that patients were recruited over some years for the studies, and no more than fifteen patients underwent any one therapy. The nature of the rheumatoid hand and its progressive nature dictates that patients will often not be similar at baseline, at the time of MCP surgery. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The review does not enable recommendation of a particular post-operative splinting regime. At this time, the results of the one study (silver level evidence) can only suggest that the use of CPM and the modified Madden protocol is not useful for increasing range of motion or grip strength over the modified Madden protocol alone, after MCP arthroplasty .</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Well-designed randomised controlled trials that compare post-operative splinting regimes with each other are needed despite the variability in each patient's hand and the relatively low numbers of arthroplasties performed. Multisite studies with collaboration between many surgeons and therapists may be needed to recruit sufficient number of participants. There is significant variation in current post-operative regimes described in the literature. Post-operative regimes being evaluated must be better described and include details on the type and frequency of exercises and splinting prescribed.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Two groups of patients were randomly allocated to different post-operative therapy regimes, following MCP arthroplasty with Swanson prostheses.<BR/>Randomisation: unmet; investigators assigned alternate hands to each treatment group; however the authors used individual fingers as the unit of analysis (without adjustment for the non-independent cluster design)<BR/>Allocation concealment: inadequate<BR/>Blinding: unmet; participants and outcome assessors were not blinded (outcome assessor described as independent)<BR/>Completeness of follow up: unmet; 5 people (3 in the intervention, 2 in the control group) missed a follow-up assessment for unknown reasons and were excluded from the study and analysis. 2 people were moved from the intervention to the control group for clinical reasons and were analysed on an as-treated basis. There was incomplete preoperative assessment of some subjects.<BR/>Explicit diagnostic criteria: met; same for both groups<BR/>Explicit outcome criteria: met; same for both groups<BR/>Baseline differences in experimental groups: unclear; not assessed statistically but the two groups appear similar in age range, proportion with surgery in dominant and non-dominant hands, time since diagnosis, pre-operative range of motion, preoperative grip strength, and preoperative lateral pinch strength.<BR/>Overall assessment of quality: high risk of bias.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>22 adults with RA, 10 in the treatment group (seven men and three women) and 12 in control (six men and six women). They were aged 30-75 years.<BR/>The treatment group had a mean of 34 degrees of motion, and the controls had a mean of 25 degrees of motion, pre-operatively, at the MCP joint<BR/>Inclusion criteria: participants with rheumatoid arthritis and disabling hand deformities, who were recommended for metacarpophalangeal silicone rubber interposition arthroplasty of the index, long, ring and small fingers.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: participants with recurrent deformities following a previous silicone rubber interposition.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment: dynamic MCP extension splinting and continuous passive motion as tolerated for six weeks; and participants wore a static MCP extension splinting at night. <BR/>Control: dynamic extension splinting (control) and exercises in the splint for 6 weeks.<BR/>Dynamic splinting continued for 6 weeks post-operatively and functional use of the hand was discouraged for six weeks post-operatively in both groups.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>1) Range of motion, MCP joint<BR/>2) Ulnar deviation MCP joint<BR/>3) Grip strength<BR/>4) Lateral pinch strength<BR/>Outcomes were measured pre-operatively and at 6 months post-operatively.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Bias may have occurred in the intervention - patients used CPM as tolerated and may have received different amounts of CPM. <BR/>It appears the unit of allocation to treatment was the hand, but the unit of analysis was the individual finger, without a correction for the cluster design (i.e. no measure of the intracluster correlation coefficient); which tends to result in artificially small P-values and overestimation of the effect of the intervention. <BR/>The authors state that they present the mean and 95% CIs for outcomes; however our interpretation of the methods of analysis indicate that 95% CI's were probably not calculated, and it is unclear what measure of variance is actually presented (possibly standard deviations, or standard errors of the mean). We have attempted to contact the authors to clarify the data.<BR/>Due to the unit of analysis and uncertainty of the variance presented, at present the data is not in a form that could be used in a meta-analysis.<BR/>The study was graded as low quality because of the potential for selection bias due to inadequate methods of randomisation and failure to conceal treatment allocation, and potential for bias in equality of treatment and incomplete measurement of outcome.</P>
