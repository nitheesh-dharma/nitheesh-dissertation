<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:10:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Human insulin has become the insulin of choice for newly diagnosed patients with diabetes mellitus. Insulin companies are eventually not going to maintain different species formulations for a declining proportion of the population with diabetes using animal insulin. Concerns exist about increased hypoglycaemia following transfer to human insulin and availability of animal insulin especially in developing countries. In our systematic review we could not identify substantial differences in the safety and efficacy between insulin species. Many important patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life and effects on diabetic complications and mortality were never investigated. Human insulin was introduced into the market without scientific proof of advantage over existing purified animal insulins, especially porcine insulin.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:10:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Human insulin was introduced for the routine treatment of diabetes mellitus in the early 1980s without adequate comparison of efficacy to animal insulin preparations. First reports of altered hypoglycaemia awareness after transfer to human insulin made physicians and especially patients uncertain about potential adverse effects of human insulin.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of different insulin species by evaluating their efficacy (in particular glycaemic control) and adverse effects profile (mainly hypoglycaemia).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-08 14:52:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A highly sensitive search for randomised controlled trials combined with key terms for identifying studies on human versus animal insulin was performed using <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE and EMBASE. We also searched reference lists and databases of ongoing trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:10:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We included randomised controlled clinical trials with diabetic patients of all ages that compared human to animal (for the most part purified porcine) insulin. Trial duration had to be at least one month in order to achieve reliable results on the main outcome parameter glycated haemoglobin.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial selection as well as evaluation of study quality was performed by two independent reviewers. The quality of reporting of each trial was assessed according to a modification of the quality criteria as specified by Schulz and by Jadad.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Altogether 2156 participants took part in the 45 randomised controlled studies that were discovered through extensive search efforts. Though many studies had a randomised, double-blind design, most studies were of poor methodological quality. Purified porcine and semi-synthetic insulin were most often investigated. No significant differences in metabolic control or hypoglycaemic episodes between various insulin species could be elucidated. Insulin dose and insulin antibodies did not show relevant dissimilarities.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A comparison of the effects of human and animal insulin as well as of the adverse reaction profile did not show clinically relevant differences. Many patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life or diabetes complications and mortality were never investigated in high-quality randomised clinical trials. The story of the introduction of human insulin might be repeated by contemporary launching campaigns to introduce pharmaceutical and technological innovations that are not backed up by sufficient proof of their advantages and safety.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:00:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. As a result there is a disturbance of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups').

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:10:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Human insulin was introduced for the routine treatment of diabetes in the early 1980s. A theoretical advantage of human insulin was thought to be its absence or low immunogenicity in diabetic patients, although the importance of insulin antibodies from a clinical point of view was never fully understood, apart from rare cases of insulin resistance and insulin allergy. Structurally, porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (at the carboxy-terminal alanine, position 30 of the B-chain) and bovine insulin differs from human insulin at three positions (B30, A8, and A10) (<LINK REF="REF-Brogden-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brogden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 1993</LINK>). Like animal insulin, human insulin manufactured by several different methods is available in various formulations (for example regular, intermediate and long-acting). Older sources of human insulin were of limited availability, requiring extraction of insulin from human cadaver pancreas, or complete chemical synthesis which involved 200 separate reaction steps. More advanced methods to develop ('biosynthetic') human insulin use recombinant DNA technology with baker's yeast or the bacterium Escherichia coli as the host cell or substitute enzymatically B30 alanine of porcine insulin with threonine to manufacture ('semisynthetic') human insulin in a highly purified (monocomponent) form (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1996</LINK>).<BR/>At the time of introduction of human insulin, marketing strategies suggested that the lower immunogenicity of human insulin and the anticipated decline in antibody titres would offer a clinical advantage for insulin-treated patients. Of the animal insulins, experts believe bovine insulin is generally more immunogenic than porcine insulin. The purity of an insulin preparation influences the quantity of insulin antibodies formed in diabetic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gregory-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 1993</LINK>). Thus, highly purified monocomponent porcine or bovine insulin induces fewer insulin antibodies than the insulin of the same formulation crystallized several times. During the 1970s, problems at injection sides such as allergy and lipoatrophy appeared to decrease concomitantly with the increasing purity of insulin preparations. It seemed logical that human insulin, which is identical in chemical structure to pancreatic insulin in man, should offer additional advantages in diabetic patients, though this was always disputed (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schernthaner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schernthaner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VanHaeften-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">VanHaeften 1989</LINK>).<BR/>The early clinical trials comparing human and animal insulins reported no significant differences in metabolic control or in the frequencies of symptomatic hypoglycaemia associated with each insulin species, and symptom profiles in diabetic patients were very similar. Subsequent clinical reports based on retrospective clinical surveys claimed that transfer to human insulin was associated with loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and that this resulted in higher frequencies of severe hypoglycaemia. Although many studies have refuted an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cryer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Everett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everett 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1993</LINK>) associated with human insulin, reports by Swiss researchers (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1989-_x0028_Add._x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1989 (Add.)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teuscher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teuscher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teuscher-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teuscher 1992</LINK>) initiated considerable concern in doctors and patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hirst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 1998</LINK>) taking human insulin. Moreover, there was a growing concern that developing countries would not be able to afford the higher expenses for human insulin. Due to the fact that in recent years major insulin producing companies ceased to manufacture animal insulin, there is a real threat of shortage of animal insulin especially in developing countries.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:02:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>A systematic review addressed the problem of the putative differences in hypoglycaemia symptoms between human and animal insulin species, taking into account studies of various designs (randomised and controlled clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies, case reports and case series (<LINK REF="REF-Airey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airey 2000</LINK>). The review concluded that the evidence did not support the contention that treatment with human insulin per se affects the frequency, severity or symptoms of hypoglycaemia. However, the main focus of that review was to investigate the main adverse effect of hypoglycaemia and not efficacy, an approach which was criticized (<LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2001</LINK>). Moreover, the reviewers' search strategy missed several trials exploring various risks and benefits of human versus animal insulin at the same time. We would therefore like to add valuable information for patients and health-care providers by enlarging the scope of our review to investigate all data on patient-relevant outcomes which can be obtained from randomised controlled clinical trials pertinent to the review objectives.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:03:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The methodological quality of reporting of each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers (BR, GN) according to a modification of the quality criteria specified by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In particular, the following quality criteria were assessed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?</LI>
<LI>minimisation of performance bias - were the participants and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?</LI>

<P>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into one of the following three categories:<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:04:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Data were included in a meta-analysis if they were of sufficient quality and sufficiently similar. We expected both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. Dichotomous data would have been expressed as relative risks. Continuous data are expressed as weighted mean differences. Due to the poor quality and clinical heterogeneity of studies we decided to only subject the parameter glycated haemoglobin to pooled analysis. Analysis has to be interpreted with caution since the measurements of glycated haemoglobin were not standardised among studies and reference ranges demonstrated distinct dissimilarities.<BR/>Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model due to anticipated between trials variance and different follow-up times. Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance being set at P &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity would have been assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Small study bias was tested for using the funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>) technique. In future updates of this review we will try to incorporate the results of crossover studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) into meta-analytical evaluations. For calculation of changes from baseline where standard deviations of differences were not provided in the publications (regarding the main outcome parameter glycated haemoglobin) we used the following approach: Within group changes of glycosylated haemoglobin show a close correlation, especially in studies of shorter duration (for example less than 6 months). When standard deviations at the start and end of a trial were identical, we conservatively set the standard deviation of the mean differences to this value. If standard deviations were very close but not identical we used the higher standard deviation for estimation.</P>

After scanning the studies identified and performing the other searches specified, we identified 93 studies which could not be excluded by scrutiny of the title and abstract, only.<BR/>Further investigation of the full articles revealed 45 studies with one duplicate publication (see <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1982</LINK>). Another article contained two studies with separate data in one report (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1982</LINK>). All these appeared to fulfil the inclusion criteria. Inter-observer calculation for sifting the literature revealed a substantial agreement of 95% (kappa = 0.90; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.0). Furthermore, one systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Airey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airey 2000</LINK>) was found.<BR/>Of these, one reference (<LINK REF="STD-Porta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 1988</LINK>) was not detected in MEDLINE but in EMBASE. On the other hand, five references (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogala-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rogala 1993</LINK>) were found in MEDLINE which could not be discovered in EMBASE.<BR/>Two studies, thought to be ongoing trials, were identified by searching the meta-register of ongoing trials (www.controlled-trials.com). According to information supplied by one of the main investigators, Dr Matthew Kiln, one study was not a randomised trial but a systematic recording of case histories. Also, the second trial was an audit of treatment satisfaction and well-being in type 1 diabetes.<BR/>Novo Nordisk supplied additional information. No unpublished studies were reported.<BR/>Forty of the trials were published in peer review journals, two as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Gardiner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gardiner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matyka-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matyka 1995</LINK>) and three in peer review journal supplements (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karam-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Karam 1983</LINK>). The majority of publications (82%) was written in English but we also found two trials printed in German (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sailer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sailer 1986</LINK>), two in Italian (<LINK REF="STD-Iavicoli-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Iavicoli 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Porta 1988</LINK>), one in Polish (<LINK REF="STD-Rogala-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rogala 1993</LINK>), two in Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Perez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Perez 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santana-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Santana 1987</LINK>) and one study in Portuguese (<LINK REF="STD-Russo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 1991</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Details of the characteristics of the included studies are shown in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. </P>
<P>Around 50% of the trials were published before 1987, approximately one third was conducted in the United Kingdom and 70% were sponsored by the manufacturers of animal and human insulins.</P>
<P>Twenty-four of the 45 included randomised studies were of a parallel design, 21 had a usually two-period- but sometimes a three- or four-period-crossover design. Units for allocation of the treatment were always individuals. The single centre design was the dominating setting (59%) but multi centre studies were also common (39%). All participants were ambulatory patients but some studies used in-hospital phases for glucose profile studies or investigations of hypoglycaemia following challenges, usually at the end of the observation period. Six of the 45 included trials came from the developing world.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Altogether 2156 participants took part in the 45 randomised controlled studies that were discovered through extensive search efforts. In trials of parallel design, 747 participants versus 734 participants tested human versus mainly porcine or bovine insulin. Numbers of participants ranged from 6 to 198 with a mean of 48 individuals. Most studies examined adults, one studied pregnant diabetic women (<LINK REF="STD-Jovanovic-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jovanovic 1992</LINK>), and four newly diagnosed diabetic children (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heding-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Heding 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 1988</LINK>). Fifty-eight per cent of crossover and parallel studies investigated type 1 diabetes patients, the female to male ratio of the whole scrutinized population was roughly balanced. The weighted mean age of participants in the parallel studies was 33.8 versus 33.7 years for human versus animal insulin, the diabetes duration 15.2 years versus 14.9 years, and the body mass index (four studies) 24.7 versus 23.3 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. Participants of crossover studies were slightly older (36.7 years) and had a diabetes of somewhat shorter duration (14.1 years). No statistically significant differences at baseline were reported in any study. One crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1984</LINK>) investigated patients' preferences: 3/15 opted for porcine and 8/15 for human insulin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most of the participants received animal insulin in the (purified) porcine form; nine studies investigated bovine insulin either alone or in combination with pork insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardiner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gardiner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selam-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Selam 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fletcher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fletcher 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jovanovic-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jovanovic 1992</LINK>). Eight trials evaluated the effects of recombinant DNA human insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beyer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colagiuri-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Colagiuri 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jovanovic-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jovanovic 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Perez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Perez 1995</LINK>), all others scrutinised the effects of semi-synthetic insulin. Trials duration ranged from one to twenty-four months with a mean of 5.8 months, follow-up was a mean of 8.2 months. Approximately half of the trials had a run-in time of 0.5-3 months in order to achieve stable metabolic conditions. Diagnostic criteria for entry into the study were specified in 50% of cases, 40% did not state how diagnosis had been established in the patients. Most studies (84%) tried to achieve a comparable insulin regimen throughout the investigation period, and treating physicians tried to achieve optimisation of therapy together with their patients by means of usually flexible insulin therapy in order to achieve metabolic targets of heterogeneously defined 'good control'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome<I>s</I>
</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported on metabolic control and insulin dosage, some on insulin antibodies and adverse effects in general, and many on hypoglycaemic episodes. None of the studies assessed diabetic complications, diabetes-related mortality or total mortality, health-related quality of life, costs or socio-economic effects.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:09:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Though many studies were of a randomised, double-blind design, most studies were of poor methodological quality ('C'). Only one study was of higher quality (<LINK REF="STD-Egger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1991</LINK>) ('B') and described methodological issues in some detail (for example, randomisation method, flow of participants, blinding of outcome assessment). Eighty-six per cent of the studies did not define a primary endpoint, only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Karam-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Karam 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maran-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maran 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oswald-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Oswald 1987</LINK>) provided a power calculation. None of the crossover studies used a wash-out period in between the two crossover phases, only three (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Egger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-1997" TYPE="STUDY">George 1997</LINK>) analysed data for carryover and period effects. Inclusion criteria were described in 73% and exclusion criteria in 55% of trials.</P>
<P>Inter-observer calculation of key elements of study quality revealed a substantial agreement of 96% (kappa = 0.93; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Covariates, confounders and effect-modifiers</HEADING>
<P>Disease severity was rarely reported; co-morbidities and co-medications - if mentioned at all - did not differ systematically between groups. Compliance as an important effect modifier, especially for introduction of new therapeutic modalities, was not investigated. Insulin antibody status at baseline was comparable between groups, though only approximately 50% of trials used a run-in period, thus theoretical carryover effects from pre-trial antibodies to animal insulin could not be ruled out in many studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Metabolic control (parallel studies)</HEADING>
<P>The term 'animal' insulin used in this review usually, unless otherwise indicated, refers to purified porcine insulin since the great majority of trials utilized this form of animal insulin treatment. Some trials investigated mixed regimens of purified porcine/bovine or rarely purified bovine insulin, only.<BR/>Three parallel designed studies reported post treatment glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements. Human insulin was associated with a non-significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) lowering of HbA1c of 0.17% (95% CI -1.05 to 0.72%) compared to animal insulin. The test for heterogeneity was significant (p=0.046). An investigation of the changes from baseline revealed similar non-significant results (0% change with a 95% CI of -0.45 to 0.46%, statistical hetereogeneity was not significant).<BR/>Nine parallel designed studies described post treatment glycated haemoglobin A1 (HbA1) measurements. Human insulin was associated with a non/significant pooled weighted mean difference lowering of HbA1 of 0.43% (95% CI -1.24 to 0.37%) compared to animal insulin. The test for heterogeneity was highly significant (p&lt;0.00001). An investigation of the changes from baseline revealed similar non-significant results (0.38% increase with a 95% CI of -0.08 to 0.84%, statistical hetereogeneity was not significant). Elimination of the single study (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez_x002d_Perez-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez-Perez 1995</LINK>) which investigated purified bovine vs recombinant DNA human insulin from the analysis of post treatment HbA1 results did not change the pooled effect size significantly. The remaining eight studies which examined purified porcine versus human insulin showed a non-significant decrease of 0.39% (95% CI -1.23 to 0.46) after human insulin compared to porcine insulin use.<BR/>The robustness of these results was furtheron investigated using different statistical models. An application of the fixed effect model revealed a significant effect in HbA1 measurements only, in favour of animal insulin. This was caused by an increased weight on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gunnarsson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gunnarsson 1986</LINK>). These disparencies between the random and fixed effects model are interpreted as indicating distinct clinical heterogeneity. We conclude that there is no clear advantage of one insulin species over the other with regards to glycated haemoglobin.<BR/>Unweighted means of fasting plasma glucose were 9.8 mmol/L in human insulin compared to 10.5 mmol/L in animal insulin treated patients (six studies).<BR/>A funnel plot of nine studies investigating post treatment HbA1 changes indicated asymmetry, suggesting small study bias (for example publication bias). Further updates of this review shall explore if scrutiny of additional unpublished trials, which hopefully will be provided by the main manufacturers of human insulin, will present the same picture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Metabolic control (crossover studies)</HEADING>
<P>Two crossover designed studies investigated HbA1c and eight studies HbA1 measurements. Due to the pronounced heterogeneous design of the various trials (for example two- or three-period-crossover phases, potential carryover effect of HbA1(c)) data were not evaluated by means of meta-analysis (future versions of this review might take advantage of newly developed methods for crossover analysis). Unweighted means of HbA1c were 7.4 versus 7.5% for human versus animal insulin. Unweighted means of HbA1 showed 10.8% for human as compared to 10.4% for animal insulin. Unweighted means of fasting plasma glucose were almost identical (8.6 mmol/L) in both groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Insulin dose, insulin antibodies (parallel and crossover studies)</HEADING>
<P>Unweighted means of post treatment insulin dose showed no relevant differences between insulin species (human versus animal insulin 43 U/day versus 47 U/day). Unweighted means of changes from baseline were 0.4 and 1.5 U/day with human and animal insulins, respectively.<BR/>The studies on immunogenicity of human and animal insulin were difficult to compare because of the different assays for insulin antibodies. Overall, depending on the duration of follow-up, a decline in insulin antibodies was observed following transfer from animal to human insulin. This tended to level out in studies of six months and longer follow-up, rarely demonstrating significant differences at the end of the trial. Beef insulin was associated with higher insulin antibody levels than pork insulin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Most studies reported no significant differences in the frequency, severity and presentation of hypoglycaemic episodes associated with the insulin preparations (unweighted means for hypoglycaemic episodes reported in 8/45 studies were 62 mild to moderate hypoglycaemic events with human insulin compared to 57 events with animal insulin). Five studies communicated unweighted means of 2.7 and 3.2 (total sum 24 and 29 incidents) severe hypoglycaemic episodes with human and animal insulins, respectively.<BR/>Other adverse effects, apart from hypoglycaemic episodes, were hardly ever reported in the trials (for example allergic reactions at the injection side), only 40% of the studies provided at least some information about adverse effects.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 19:00:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We found 45 randomised controlled clinical trials consisting of 24 parallel group studies and 21 crossover studies with a median follow-up of six months. A total of 2156 patients with diabetes mellitus participated in these studies. Despite heterogeneous designs, participants, and locations neither parallel nor crossover trials suggested an important difference between insulin species regarding metabolic control as measured by glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin dose. Most studies did not detect a significant difference in antibody formation between human and porcine insulin; one report observed a significant decline in antibodies after switch from bovine to human insulin. The overall picture with regard to hypoglycaemic events does not indicate any substantial difference between insulin species.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">New findings</HEADING>
<P>A recently published study investigated the prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia in relation to various risk factors in type 1 and 2 diabetic patients over a period of 14 zears (<LINK REF="REF-Bragd-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bragd 2003</LINK>). Despite the more frequent use of self-monitoring of blood glucose, the prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia increased from 17% in the cohort of n = 178 participants (1984) to 27% in the cohort of n = 178 participants (1998) (27% relative risk increase, p &lt; 0.05). A stepwise logistic multiple regression analysis of various risk factors (hypoglycaemia unawareness, HbA1c, creatinine clearance, nocturnal events, daily monitoring of blood glucose, duration of diabetes, age, multiple insulin injection therapy including pump treatment) for severe hypoglycaemia explained less than 10% of the variance, implicating only unawareness of hypoglycaemia and HbA1c levels.<BR/>A consequent letter to the editor (personal communication) drew attention to the fact that this study did not mention that during the period of investigation synthetic human insulins were introduced and the majority of patients were transferred from animal insulin. It would have been interesting, if possible, to introduce the parameter 'transfer from animal to human insulin' into the logistic regression equation to find out its influence on the prediction of severe hypoglycaemia.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 19:00:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The results of this review may not have an effect on the availability or non-availability of animal insulin worldwide. Market forces dictated a change in policy before the available evidence was summarized in a systematic way. Future introductions of new therapeutic priniciples for diabetic patients should take into account that possible advantages and disadvantages have to be thoroughly investigated in high quality trials focusing on patient-oriented outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review is in accordance with the findings of the systematic review of Airey et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Airey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airey 2000</LINK>) with respect to the absence of a differential effect on hypoglycaemia between human and animal insulin. For the first time though, this review aggregates the relative effects and adverse events of human and animal insulin, indicating that human insulin was introduced without proof of being superior to animal insulin. Moreover, studies have not assessed patient-centred outcomes like patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and diabetes-related morbidity. Furthermore, randomised trials did not report on qualitative assessments of patients' experiences when using different insulin species.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large scale drug utilisation studies should evaluate the situation of worldwide insulin species use focusing on the developing world. These data should provide health-politicians with sufficient backup to enter negotiations with insulin manufacturing companies. </P>
