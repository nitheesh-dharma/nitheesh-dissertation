<P>Collection of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity is called chylothorax. Routine management of this condition involves treatment of the underlying condition, draining of fluid, putting a tube in the chest wall until all the fluid is drained and rarely surgery. Octreotide is a drug that may reduce the production and accumulation of fluid and allow babies to recover faster. No trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug in babies and only case reports are available. Future studies are needed.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials were identified. Nineteen case reports of 20 neonates with chylothorax in whom octreotide was used either subcutaneously or intravenously were identified. Fourteen case reports described successful use (resolution of chylothorax), four reported failure (no resolution) and one reported equivocal results following use of octreotide. The timing of initiation, dose, duration and frequency of doses varied markedly. Gastrointestinal intolerance and clinical presentations suggestive of necrotizing enterocolitis and transient hypothyroidism were reported as side effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-28 16:28:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 04:58:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chylothorax is defined as accumulation of lymphatic fluid or chyle in the pleural space. Chyle is composed of fats (phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides), proteins (albumin, immunoglobulins and fibrinogen), electrolytes, fat soluble vitamins and lymphocytes. The diagnosis of chylothorax is considered when pleural fluid assay has a triglyceride level &gt; 1.1 mmol/L and total cell count of &gt; 1000 cells/ml with &gt; 80% lymphocytes. Without oral fat intake, the distinction between chylous and non-chylous effusion is difficult because chylomicrons are absent in the pleural fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Buttiker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttiker 1999</LINK>). In non-feeding infants, the diagnosis of chylothorax is made by identifying the presence of a high number of lymphocytes in serous fluid.</P>
<P>Chylothorax can be unilateral or bilateral and congenital or acquired. Congenital chylothorax is associated with abnormalities of the lymphatic system such as lymphangiomatosis and lymphangiectasia, congenital heart disease, mediastinal malignancies, chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 21, Turners and Noonan syndromes) and H-type of tracheoesophageal fistula (<LINK REF="REF-Rasiah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasiah 2004</LINK>). Acquired chylothorax is usually due to trauma to the thoracic duct during cardiac or thoracic surgery. The incidence of congenital chylothorax is reported to be 1 in 10,000 births (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1999</LINK>). Many cases of chylothorax have no clear etiology and are considered as idiopathic congenital chylothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Au-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Au 2003</LINK>). The reported case fatality rate is 15% to 57%; however mortality is higher when there is associated hydrops fetalis (<LINK REF="REF-Brissaud-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brissaud 2003</LINK> ). Significant in-utero chylothoraces may impair lung development and result in pulmonary hypoplasia. Attempts to treat chylothorax by drainage may lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance and infection (<LINK REF="REF-Wasmuth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasmuth 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antenatal management of chylothorax consists of thoracentesis or pleuro-amniotic shunts to prevent pulmonary hypoplasia. In the postnatal period, the management of the pleural effusion can be either conservative or surgical. The conservative approach includes management of underlying disease, repeated thoracentesis, continuous drainage, dietary modifications (medium chain triglyceride diet or total parental nutrition), use of positive end expiratory pressure during mechanical ventilation and chemical or mechanical pleurodesis. The surgical approach includes thoracoscopic pleurodesis, pleuroperitoneal pump, surgical abrasion, ligation of the thoracic duct and creation of a thoracic duct to azygous vein anastomosis (<LINK REF="REF-Brissaud-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brissaud 2003</LINK>). None of these therapeutic modalities have undergone controlled clinical trials; however these treatments are commonly used in the clinical setting.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 00:23:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is used for the management of patients with refractory chylothorax, not responding to conservative management (<LINK REF="REF-Goto-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goto 2003</LINK>). The use of octreotide in the treatment of chylothorax in infants and children has been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Helin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roehr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roehr 2006</LINK>). Both reviews suggested that octreotide has the potential to be a potent and effective therapy for chylous pleural effusion. However, it has not been studied in randomised trials. Octreotide has been used for a variety of indications in adults and older children including acromegaly, carcinoid tumour, acute variceal bleeding, gastrointestinal fistulae and intractable diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Lamberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamberts 1996</LINK>). In neonates, octreotide has been used for the management of persistent hyperinsulinaemic states (<LINK REF="REF-Glaser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-07-28 16:28:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism of action of octreotide in chylothorax is uncertain. It is proposed that octreotide causes mild vasoconstriction of splanchnic vessels, including hepatic venous flow. This leads to reduction in gastric, pancreatic and intestinal secretions as well as intestinal absorption. These mechanisms collectively reduce the flow of chyle (<LINK REF="REF-Rasiah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasiah 2004</LINK>). Animal studies have shown that octreotide is effective in treating thoracic duct injury by reducing the chyle drainage and allowing early fistula closure (<LINK REF="REF-Markham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markham 2000</LINK>). However, octreotide is associated with adverse effects such as arrhythmias, injection site pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, dizziness and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Buck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buck 2004</LINK>). Other adverse effects include transient impairment of liver function, transient hypothyroidism and necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Mohseni_x002d_Bod-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohseni-Bod 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maayan_x002d_Metzaer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maayan-Metzaer 2005</LINK>). Arevalo et al reported octreotide induced hypoxaemia and pulmonary hypertension in preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Arevalo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arevalo 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-07-26 00:43:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the reported benefit in reduction of chyle production in uncontrolled case studies, octreotide has not been systematically evaluated in newborns with chylothorax. Moreover, the safety profile in relation to adverse effects, dosing schedule, route of administration and duration of therapy has not been evaluated.</P>

<P>All published articles identified as potentially relevant by the literature search were assessed for inclusion in the review by both review authors (AD and PS). Data from authors were to be obtained where published data provided inadequate information for the review or where relevant data could not be abstracted. Both authors contributed to the literature search and article review. Retrieved articles were assessed and data were abstracted. Discrepancies regarding inclusion and exclusion of the studies were resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-07-26 01:07:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If studies were selected for inclusion, we planned to collect information regarding study methodology (including the method of randomisation, blinding, drug intervention, stratification and whether the trial was single or multicenter) and information regarding trial participants (including birth weight criteria and other inclusion or exclusion criteria).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-26 01:15:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to independently review the methodological quality of each trial. We planned to assess each identified trial for methodological quality with respect to: a) masking of allocation, b) masking of intervention, c) completeness of follow up, d) masking of outcome assessment. This information was to be included in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>In addition, we planned to complete the 'Risk of bias' table addressing the following methodological issues. </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process for example random number table, computer random number generator); inadequate (any non-random process for example odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or unclear. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (for example telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or unclear. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We planned to assess the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and the specific outcomes assessed. </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to address whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We planned to assess methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data) or unclear. </P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to assess the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it was clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported); inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes were reported, one or more of the reported primary outcomes was not pre-specified, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used, study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear.  </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to note any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We planned to assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias, as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

<P>The literature search identified 287 potential titles which were screened by checking titles and abstracts. Screening of titles and abstracts led to 43 articles which were identified for further review. Two of these were reviews on the subject, published in Spanish (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 2005</LINK>) and Portugese (<LINK REF="REF-Rocha-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocha 2007</LINK>). They were not retrieved for further assessment because the abstracts clearly indicated that these were not eligible for inclusion. Of the remaining 41 articles retrieved for full assessment, none of them were eligible for inclusion in this review as none of the studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. All were case reports of neonates, infants and children.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-07-26 04:25:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of the intervention were studied in case reports only. We have summarized the results of case reports in a table below (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Of the 19 case reports of 20 neonates, 14 reported successful resolution of chylothorax whereas four reported failure of resolution of chylothorax with octreotide. One report indicated equivocal results. Octreotide was initiated between the second and 109<SUP>th</SUP> day after birth. It was given either subcutaneously or intravenously. The dose ranged between 10 to 70 µg/kg/day when used subcutaneously and between 0.3 and 10 µg/kg/h when used as an intravenous infusion. The frequency of administration ranged from six hourly to 24 hourly for subcutaneous administration and was mostly by continuous infusion for intravenous administration. The duration of administration in cases of successful resolution varied between four and 21 days; however, it was mostly guided by response to therapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-28 16:40:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The safety and efficacy of octreotide in the treatment of chylothorax in neonates has not been evaluated properly. The rarity of the condition is the main rate limiting step. Case reports of the use of octreotide have shown promising results; however, methodological bias prevails. If reports of unsuccessful usage of octeotride are less likely to be submitted or accepted for publication than are reports of successful usage, then publication bias will result. With reports of potential side effects such as necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Reck_x002d_Burneo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reck-Burneo 2008</LINK>), persistent pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Arevalo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arevalo 2003</LINK>), transient hyperthyroxinemia (<LINK REF="REF-Mohseni_x002d_Bod-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohseni-Bod 2004</LINK>), cholelithiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Radetti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radetti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andreou-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreou 2005</LINK>) and inhibition of retinal neo-vascularization (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qu 2009</LINK>), it is important that octreotide is evaluated properly before its use becomes routine practice. The natural history of chylothorax includes spontaneous postnatal resolution over a few days. An effect observed in certain cases of effectiveness, in terms of reduction in chest fluid, could well fit in this category and unless properly evaluated the question regarding efficacy remains.</P>
<P>Due to the rarity of this condition, multicenter efforts will be needed. In order to design proper trials to evaluate efficacy, we need to identify the natural history of this condition. A prospective multicenter registry of such cases would be the best way to assess the duration of chylous drainage, amount of chylous drainage and its impact on respiratory outcomes. Once these outcomes are known, a multicenter randomised clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide.</P>
<P>Referral centres for prenatal diagnosis would be ideal sites for such a study. Based on published reports, the population of interest should be those with idiopathic chylothoraces, which could be stratified to include postoperative chylothoraces. Included infants should be managed with routine care and those who do not respond to therapy by five days should be the target population. It appears that early, high doses were most beneficial; however, it would need to be monitored closely (<LINK REF="REF-Helin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helin 2006</LINK>). Octreotide should be given subcutaneously or intravenously; however, the preferable route will be by intravenous infusion as the presence of subcutaneous edema in some infants with associated hydrops may lead to variable absorption of the medication. Outcomes of interest can be mean change in the fluid drainage over a specified time, duration of respiratory support and resolution of chylothorax. Safety should also be of importance and side effects such as pulmonary hypertension, development of intestinal complications and, if used in preterm neonates, the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity should be monitored.</P>

<P>A multicenter randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of octreotide in the treatment of chylothorax in neonates. Such a trial should have neonates with idiopathic chylothorax diagnosed antenatally or postnatally as population, failure to spontaneous resolution by seven days as entry criteria, must receive octreotide via subcutaneous or intravenous route, and have improvement in the amount of chylous drainage by at least 50% within three days of attaining pre-determined maximum dose and improvement in respiratory status (significant reduction in the need for respiratory support by seven days of initiation of treatment) as primary outcomes and side effects and mortality as secondary outcomes.</P>
