<TITLE>Treatments for swelling of an artery in the groin following vascular procedures</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:27:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with heart disease and diseased leg arteries often undergo investigations and treatments that involve placing a needle into the main artery in the groin (endovascular procedures, for example diagnostic arteriogram, angioplasty, cardiac catheterization). One possible complication is the formation of a large swelling in the artery (a pseudoaneurysm) in the groin. This happens when the hole that the needle makes in the wall of the artery does not seal properly afterwards and blood collects, causing pain, swelling and bruising. Small pseudoaneurysms may clot spontaneously or surgery may be required. Less invasive treatment is now possible to stop the blood flow into the swelling. This involves sedation or analgesia to allow pressure to be placed over the puncture in the artery using a special mechanical device or a probe guided by ultrasound. Another option is injection of a clotting agent (thrombin) through the skin into the swelling.</P>
<P>The review authors searched the medical literature and found four randomised controlled trials. No new studies were included in this update. Application of pressure (compression) with a mechanical device for some 30 minutes caused clotting of the blood in the pseudoaneurysm in three-quarters of people (38 people aged between 40 and 85 years) within 24 hours. It made no difference if the probe was placed blindly or using ultrasound. A further study of 168 people found that compression caused clotting of the pseudoaneurysm in more than 90% of people at 24 hours; again, using ultrasound did not seem to make any difference. Injection of bovine thrombin appeared to be more effective that ultrasound-guided compression (in two studies, including 68 patients in total). There are, however, concerns about allergy to the thrombin and introduction of infectious agents, thought to be responsible for transmission of some degenerative diseases, as well as the possibility of causing a blood clot in the artery. No complications were reported in these studies apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the people treated with compression.</P>

<P>Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, but sometimes definitive treatment is needed. Surgery has traditionally been considered the 'gold standard' treatment, although it is not without risk in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Less invasive treatment options such as Duplex ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous thrombin injection are available, however, evidence of their efficacy is limited.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-01-23 07:35:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms following vascular interventional procedures were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-01-23 07:32:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies were included in the analyses comparing: manual compression versus ultrasound-guided compression; ultrasound-guided application of a mechanical device (FemoStop) versus blind application; and ultrasound-guided compression versus percutaneous thrombin injection (two studies).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-23 07:34:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compression (manual or FemoStop) was effective in achieving pseudoaneurysm thrombosis although ultrasound-guided application failed to confer any benefit (risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.04).</P>
<P>Percutaneous thrombin injection was more effective than a single session of ultrasound-guided compression in achieving primary pseudoaneurysm thrombosis within individual RCTs but merged data failed to show statistical significance (RR 2.81; 95% CI 0.44 to 18.13). There was no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups and no complications were reported apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the compression group.</P>

<P>The limited evidence base appears to support the use of thrombin injection as an effective treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysm. A pragmatic approach may be to use compression (blind or ultrasound-guided) as first-line treatment, reserving thrombin injection for those in whom the compression procedure fails.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 10:43:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-23 08:01:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-01-23 07:51:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) occurs when blood escapes from the lumen of an artery through a defect in one or more layers of the arterial wall and forms a localized pocket of flow either beneath the adventitia (outer wall of the artery) or in the surrounding tissues. They are most commonly found in the groin as a complication of endovascular procedures (for example diagnostic arteriogram, angioplasty, cardiac catheterization); vascular trauma; or following open vascular surgery (for example aortobifemoral bypass, femoro-popliteal bypass). Pseudoaneurysms following previous vascular surgery are often associated with vascular graft infection and require debridement (removal) of infected tissue and often complete or partial graft removal. This review only considers pseudoaneurysms following endovascular procedures (that is iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms).</P>
<P>Pseudoaneurysms result from poor haemostasis (failure to control blood flow) at the time of the initial treatment, that is inadequate compression of the puncture site after withdrawing the catheter or sheath, or failure to use a closure device. Frequently these patients are anticoagulated (receiving anti-clotting therapy) or have a coagulopathy (clotting disorder) and this may compound the problem. Pseudoaneurysms are reported to occur in 1% of diagnostic arteriograms and up to 8% of therapeutic endovascular interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Eternad_x002d_Rezai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eternad-Rezai 2003</LINK>). Symptoms include pain, swelling, and bruising in the groin area and possible rupture of the pseudoaneurysm.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-01-23 07:59:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of treatment is to cause thrombosis (clotting) of the pseudoaneurysm. Duplex ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice and demonstrates a high velocity jet through a defect in the arterial wall on colour flow imaging. A proportion of small pseudoaneurysms may spontaneously clot over time and active observation is, therefore, an option. For those pseudoaneurysms that need treatment, surgery has traditionally been considered as the 'gold standard'. This may require simple suture of the defect after evacuation of the haematoma (blood-filled swelling) or a patch angioplasty (surgical repair using a patch).</P>
<P>Ultrasound-guided compression is now increasingly used as a therapeutic tool, to avoid the need for surgery. Compression with the ultrasound probe at the site of communication between the false aneurysm and the native artery abolishes flow through the arterial wall and allows thrombosis of the aneurysm sac to occur. Patients will require effective analgesia or sedation, or both, in order to tolerate the procedure, which involves compression for 10 minutes at a time and repeated for up to 60 minutes. Success rates of 63% to 88% have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>). A mechanical device, such as the FemoStop (Radi Medical Systems, Uppsala, Sweden) may also be used to compress a pseudoaneurysm.</P>
<P>A number of studies have reported successful thrombosis of femoral pseudoaneurysms using Duplex ultrasound-guided percutaneous bovine thrombin injection (<LINK REF="REF-Edgerton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgerton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lonn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2000</LINK>). This can be performed as an outpatient procedure. Thrombin in a concentration of 1000 U/ml is injected slowly into the pseudoaneurysm, with thrombosis frequently occurring within five seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Eternad_x002d_Rezai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eternad-Rezai 2003</LINK>). The reported dose needed is between 20 U and 6000 U (<LINK REF="REF-Eternad_x002d_Rezai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eternad-Rezai 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2002</LINK>). A primary success rate of 95% to 98% has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Maleux-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maleux 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohler 2001</LINK>). Thrombin injection can be associated with immediate complications such as thrombosis of the native artery and, rarely, venous thrombosis. Delayed reperfusion of the aneurysm may occur in 6% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2002</LINK>). A potential problem with the use of bovine thrombin may be contamination with prions (protein-related infectious agents, thought to be responsible for transmission of some degenerative diseases). One study has overcome this risk by using autologous thrombin prepared from patients' blood for treatment of pseudoaneurysms (<LINK REF="REF-Quarmby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quarmby 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent study described the use of para-aneurysmal saline in the treatment of femoral pseudoaneurysms, that is injection of saline around the communication between the false aneurysm and the native artery, abolishing blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Gehling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gehling 2003</LINK>). Endovascular treatment methods such as coil embolization (using a coil to encourage formation of a blood clot, thus filling the aneurysm) or stent-grafts (a prosthetic tube lying within the artery) have also been used to treat femoral pseudoaneurysms (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 1999</LINK>: this study recruited 38 patients with iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms over a two-year period (12 from cardiac catheterisation, 18 following coronary angioplasty, two following electrophysiological studies, and six following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). The main inclusion criterion was that the pseudoaneurysm was compressible on ultrasound. Patients with local infection, critical limb ischaemia, skin necrosis, and a pseudoaneurysm arising above the level of the inguinal ligament were excluded. In both treatment groups, the pseudoaneurysm was compressed using a FemoStop compression device, which is a pneumatic plastic dome secured around the patient's waist with an adjustable belt. Compression was used for 20 minutes initially, with a further 20 minutes if needed. Patients were randomised into ultrasound-guided application of the FemoStop (n = 19) or blind application over the puncture site (n = 19). The two groups were matched for age, sex, pseudoaneurysm diameter, pseudoaneurysm track diameter (communication between pseudoaneurysm and native artery), use of anticoagulants, and use of antiplatelet drugs. The primary outcome measure was successful thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Paschalidis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Paschalidis 2006</LINK>: this study recruited patients with pseudoaneurysms following cardiac or peripheral catheterisation over a 28-month period. One hundred and eighty-five patients were diagnosed; 17 were excluded because of imminent pseudoaneurysm rupture, massive haematoma, skin necrosis, infection, and ischaemia; 168 patients were then randomised into manual compression (n = 84) or ultrasound-guided compression (n = 84). Manual compression involved direct pressure over the arterial puncture site until the pulsation in the haematoma or palpable thrill over the artery disappeared (maximum compression time 60 minutes); ultrasound-guided compression was applied using the authors' standard protocol, up to a maximum time of 60 minutes. Patients in both groups had a repeat ultrasound at 24 hours; for failed pseudoaneurysm thrombosis, re-treatment was allowed using the same protocol up to a maximum of three treatments.

<LINK REF="STD-Lonn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lonn 2004</LINK>: this study recruited 30 patients with iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms over a 22-month period (26 from a coronary artery intervention, four from a peripheral vascular intervention). Consecutive patients with compressible pseudoaneurysms were considered for inclusion in the study. Patients with local skin infection, previous exposure to bovine thrombin, severe allergy, or a pseudoaneurysm neck &gt; 10 mm were excluded. Patients were randomised to ultrasound-guided compression (n = 15) or ultrasound-guided thrombin injection (n = 15). Compression was undertaken using the FemoStopIIPLUS compression device (Radi Medical Systems, Uppsala, Sweden). Compression above diastolic pressure was used initially for 30 minutes, followed by a second 30-minute period if needed. A further 30 minutes of compression was then used at 40 mm Hg followed by two hours at 20 mm Hg. In the thrombin group, a 25-G or 22-G needle attached to a syringe containing 1 ml of bovine thrombin (1000 U/ml) was placed in the pseudoaneurysm cavity under ultrasound control. Injection was stopped once flow ceased in the pseudoaneurysm cavity. The two groups were matched for age, sex, aetiology, use of anticoagulants, and use of antiplatelet drugs. The primary outcome measure was successful thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm within 24 hours. The secondary outcome measures were thrombosis within 48 hours (allowing for repeat treatments), complication rates, and length of hospital stay.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-23 08:45:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of the review was to identify the most efficacious treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms. However, only four RCTs were identified with a total of 274 patients randomised. There were no RCTs comparing surgery (traditionally considered as the 'gold standard' treatment) with another treatment. Blind compression of the pseudoaneurysm (either using manual pressure or with a FemoStop device) is feasible, with good technical success rates. Ultrasound-guided compression appears to confer no benefit over applying blind compression over the arterial puncture site. Percutaneous thrombin injection appears to be more effective than ultrasound-guided compression in achieving primary thrombosis of a pseudoaneurysm within individual RCTs. However, merged data (using a random-effects model) does not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Guidance from the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence states that 'current evidence on the safety and efficacy of thrombin injections for pseudoaneurysms appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance' (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Neither RCT reported any complications (including arterial thrombosis) from thrombin injection, although these were small sample sizes (a total of 34 patients treated with thrombin). Case studies have suggested that the complication rate from thrombin injection is 0% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>). Concerns about prion transmission from bovine thrombin still exist. However, a number of reports have used human thrombin in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms, which is available as one of the components of a tissue adhesive (for example Tisseel, Baxter Healthcare) (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-01-28 17:20:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, results were based on aggregate analyses of relatively small single-center studies and therefore the external validity of the findings is limited. Thrombin appears to be more effective than ultrasound-guided compression for femoral pseudoaneurysms and might be considered as the new 'gold standard'. However, the quality of the randomisation method may limit the internal validity of these results. There are potentially serious complications with thrombin, although none were reported in the included RCTs. Blind compression appears to be as effective as ultrasound-guided compression.<BR/>
<BR/>A pragmatic approach may be to consider compression (with or without ultrasound) as first-line treatment, reserving thrombin injection for those in whom the procedure fails.</P>

<P>A multicentre prospective RCT of thrombin injection versus ultrasound-guided compression may provide further data to support the findings of this review. However, researchers might not approach this from a position of equipoise.</P>
