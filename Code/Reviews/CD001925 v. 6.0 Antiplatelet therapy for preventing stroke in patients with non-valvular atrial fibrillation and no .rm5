<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:12:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Antiplatelet agents like aspirin are effective for preventing serious vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation not suitable for oral anticoagulants. Atrial fibrillation is an irregularity of the heartbeat that leads to blood clots forming in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). These clots can break free and travel through the bloodstream to the brain and cause a stroke. Drugs that slow clotting, such as antiplatelet agents (aspirin and others) and anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review the benefits of antiplatelet agents are shown to be modest (nearly 25% decrease in stroke), but they are relatively safe, easy to take, and therefore an important treatment option for many atrial fibrillation patients. Anticoagulation with warfarin and related drugs offers more protection against stroke (nearly two-thirds reduction), but anticoagulant drugs can cause severe bleeding and require careful regulation with regular blood tests. The choice of antiplatelet drugs versus anticoagulants should be individualized based on the patient's inherent risk of stroke, ability to tolerate anticoagulation without bleeding, access to adequate anticoagulation monitoring, and patient preferences.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) carries an increased risk of stroke. Antiplatelet therapy (APT) is proven effective for stroke prevention in most patients at high-risk for vascular events, but its value for primary stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF merits separate consideration because of the suspected cardioembolic mechanism of most strokes in AF patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:11:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term APT for primary prevention of stroke in patients with chronic non-valvular AF.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:12:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched August 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004), and the reference lists of recent review articles. We also contacted experts working in the field to identify unpublished and ongoing trials.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:12:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomized trials comparing long-term APT with placebo or control in patients with non-valvular AF and no history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. A sensitivity analysis included one additional randomized trial involving primary prevention with aspirin plus very low dose warfarin.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:12:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data for each outcome. Unpublished data were obtained from trial investigators.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:12:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Three trials tested aspirin in dosages ranging from 75 mg to 325 mg per day and 125 mg every other day to placebo (in two trials) or control (in one trial) in 1965 AF patients without prior stroke or TIA. The mean duration of follow up averaged 1.3 years per participant. Aspirin was associated with non-significant lower risks of all stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.07), ischemic stroke (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.07), all disabling or fatal stroke (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49) and all-cause death (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04). The combination of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death was significantly reduced (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97 ). No increase in intracranial hemorrhage or major extracranial hemorrhage was observed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:29:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Aspirin appears to reduce stroke and major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF similar to its effect in other high-risk patients (i.e. by about 25%). For primary prevention among AF patients with an average stroke rate of 4% per year, about 10 strokes would likely be prevented yearly for every 1000 AF patients given aspirin.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:14:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting about 0.7% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Feinberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Go-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 2001</LINK>). Its prevalence increases with age; about 5% of people over age 65 years and 10% of people over age 80 years suffer AF (<LINK REF="REF-Feinberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinberg 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>AF is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke and is a powerful independent risk factor for cerebral ischemia. It is associated with about 16% of all ischemic strokes and is a frequent cause of disabling stroke in the elderly, particularly in women (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf--1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1991</LINK>). The overall risk of stroke among non-anticoagulated patients with AF without prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) averaged 4% per year among participants in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>) and 2.5% per year in a large outpatient cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Go-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rate of stroke varies widely, depending on coexisting cardiovascular disorders. Identification of subgroups of AF patients with relatively high versus low absolute rates of stroke is important for selecting the appropriate prophylactic therapy. Prospective studies have shown that age, hypertension, prior TIA or stroke, diabetes, congestive heart failure and female gender are independently predictive of stroke in AF patients and significantly increase the stroke risk (<LINK REF="REF-Gage-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiplatelet therapy (APT) has been shown to reduce stroke by about 25% in high-risk patients with a variety of vascular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). Because most strokes occurring in AF patients are suspected to be due to embolism of stasis-precipitated thrombi originating in the left atrial appendage (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK>), the effect of APT for stroke prevention in AF patients may not be identical to that in patients with threatened stroke due to primary arterial pathologies. Further, it has been hypothesized that any effect of APT in AF patients would be on non-cardioembolic strokes which tend to be smaller and less disabling (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review includes all randomized trials of APT versus placebo or control for the primary prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. Our goals were to determine whether there was clear evidence that APT is efficacious and safe in these patients and to characterize the magnitude of any benefit.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:14:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To characterize the effect of long-term APT on major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF and no history of stroke or TIA. Our main hypotheses were:<BR/>(1) APT compared to placebo or control would reduce ischemic events: ischemic strokes, myocardial infarction (MI), systemic emboli, and vascular death (with a smaller decrease in all-cause death);<BR/>(2) APT compared to placebo or control would increase bleeding events: intracranial hemorrhage and major extracranial hemorrhage;<BR/>(3) APT compared to placebo or control would decrease clinically relevant combinations of ischemic plus bleeding events: all stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), disabling or fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), and the composite of all stroke, MI or vascular death.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:22:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We sought to identify all unconfounded, randomized trials in which long-term APT (more than four weeks) was compared to placebo or control in patients with chronic non-valvular AF. Both trials in which the intervention was masked (that is, double-blinded) and in which the intervention was given open-label were considered. Trials involving iatrogenic cardioversion for recent-onset AF were excluded.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis included a fourth trial (SAFT) in which APT was combined with very low, fixed-dose of warfarin that did not measurably prolong the INR because of the expected negligible effect of warfarin (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hylek-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hylek 2003</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:14:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Participants with AF documented by electrocardiogram (ECG), either intermittent (that is, paroxysmal) or sustained (that is, constant) were included. Those with mitral stenosis or prosthetic cardiac valves were not included.</P>
<P>For the main analyses excepting all-cause mortality, participants in the <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> trial and in the <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> trial with prior stroke or TIA were excluded by accessing unpublished data from the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database of pooled individual participant data, with permission of the investigators (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>). For all-cause mortality, only published data were available that included these patients.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or other specific platelet antiaggregants given in any dose, formulation, combination, or frequency were considered. APT included agents whose primary antithrombotic action is presumed to be inhibition of platelet aggregation (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, indobufen, triflusal).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:15:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We chose 10 clinically-relevant outcomes that were hypothesized to be influenced by antiplatelet therapy.<BR/>(1) All strokes (ischemic and hemorrhagic) was the primary outcome. While this was selected <I>post hoc, </I>it was deemed the most relevant outcome for a disorder whose main health risk is stroke.<BR/>(2) Ischemic strokes (including both fatal and non-fatal). Diagnosis based on clinical features, not requiring confirmation by neuroimaging. Asymptomatic brain infarcts detected on neuroimaging were not included. Hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic strokes were counted as ischemic strokes.<BR/>(3) All disabling or fatal stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic). Strokes were deemed fatal when death ensued within 30 days of onset from the consequences of stroke. 'Disabling' relied on varying criteria between studies. From the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>), the category of stroke with residual deficit was taken as disabling stroke, defined as functional neurological deficits persisting one to three months after stroke onset.<BR/>(4) MI (fatal and non-fatal). The diagnosis of MI was based upon electrocardiographic changes, elevation of enzymes or was confirmed during post-mortem examination<BR/>(5) Systemic (that is, non CNS) emboli. Symptomatic cardioembolic arterial occlusions involving areas other than the brain. Non-cardioembolic arterial occlusions were not included, when so identified, nor was pulmonary embolism.<BR/>(6) All intracranial hemorrhage. This includes intraparenchymal, subdural and epidural hematomas and subarachnoid hemorrhage based on clinical diagnosis by the investigators and confirmed by CT scan or postmortem.<BR/>(7) Major extracranial hemorrhage. Criteria varied between the studies considered in this analysis. From the AFI database, those which required transfusion of two or more units of red blood cells, hospitalization, or invasive procedures to control bleeding and those that resulted in death or permanent functional impairment (for example, blindness) were included.<BR/>(8) Vascular death. These consisted of death due to stroke, heart disease, hemorrhage, and sudden deaths of unknown cause.<BR/>(9) Composite outcome: all stroke (disabling and non-disabling, hemorrhagic and ischemic), MI or vascular death.<BR/>(10) All cause mortality: death from any cause (vascular and non-vascular) within 30 days from onset of stroke symptoms. For this outcome, the results of published data, which included 112 patients from <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> with prior stroke or TIA, were used.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register which was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator in August 2004. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2005), and MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004), not restricted to any languages, using the following text words: atrial fibrillation, stroke, aspirin, APT, antithrombotic, clinical trial, cerebrovascular disease, embolism. In addition, we contacted the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators Collaboration and experts working in the field seeking information about trials currently in progress.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:16:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The authors independently assessed trials for potential inclusion, and abstracted the outcomes of interest from published sources. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, method of randomization, masked versus open-label intervention, antithrombotic agents in the control group, losses to follow up, adherence to assigned therapy, and intention-to-treat design were extracted. We resolved differences by discussion.</P>
<P>A few (6%) participants with prior stroke or TIA or both (usually occurring months to years before entry) were included in the <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> trials, and outcomes for these participants were not separately reported. Hence, to permit our principal analyses to be restricted to primary prevention, we obtained unpublished data from the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database (with the permission of the <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> investigators) eliminating those with prior stroke or TIA and using an intention-to-treat paradigm. The Atrial Fibrillation Investigators have pooled results from individual patient data from multiple randomized clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-AFI-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFI 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Walraven 2002</LINK>). The Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database was also used for the combined outcome of all stroke, MI or vascular death in <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>, which was not available in published sources.</P>
<P>For the Low-dose Aspirin, Stroke, Atrial Fibrillation (<LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>) trial, we contacted the study investigators to confirm that published results were based on an intention-to-treat paradigm and to obtain unpublished outcomes.</P>
<P>Treatment effect was calculated using a fixed-effect model (Peto method) and relative reductions calculated for each outcome. Heterogeneity between included trials was assessed using a standard chi square test. The intention-to-treat analysis included all events observed according to originally-assigned treatment (that is, events occurring in those off therapy were counted). No participant was lost to follow up after randomization in the <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> trial and this was not reported in <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>, and hence, sensitivity analysis that considered those lost to follow up could not be carried out. The annualised event rate estimates were used to calculate an absolute risk reduction by multiplying by (1-odds ratio). In the <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK> trial, participants were randomly assigned to one of two aspirin regimens (125 mg daily versus 125 mg every other day) versus control. For these analyses, both aspirin arms were combined and compared with the smaller number assigned to placebo.</P>
<P>Odds ratio (the more accurate term) and risk ratio are used interchangeably throughout the review with good approximation because of the relatively low frequency of events.</P>
<P>In addition to the main analyses, one sensitivity analysis was performed. This included results of the <LINK REF="STD-SAFT" TYPE="STUDY">SAFT</LINK> trial, in which aspirin-assigned patients also received low, inefficacious fixed-doses of warfarin that did not prolong the INR and hence was expected to be equivalent to aspirin alone. This analysis considered three outcomes: all stroke, ischemic stroke, and death.</P>

<P>Three trials were included in the main analyses: Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (<LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK>), the Atrial Fibrillation, ASpirin, AntiKoagulation (<LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>), and the Low-dose Aspirin, Stroke, Atrial Fibrillation (<LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> (1985 to 1989) was a multicenter trial conducted in the USA; <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> (1985 to 1988) was done in Copenhagen, Denmark; the <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK> (1990 to 1996) was from Spain. The mean age of participants ranged from 66 years in the <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK> to 74 years in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>, with the overall mean age of 70 years for participants in the three trials. Women made up 38% of all participants (30% in <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK>, 46% in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>, 49% in <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> did not include those with intermittent (that is, paroxysmal) AF, whereas 33% of <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK>, and 17% of <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK> participants had intermittent AF. All participants in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> were deemed anticoagulation-eligible (for adjusted-dose warfarin), as were one third of <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> participants.</P>
<P>In all three trials, aspirin was the APT. Two trials compared aspirin (325 mg per day in <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK>, 75 mg per day in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>) to placebo (double-masked), while in the <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>, aspirin was given open-label (125 mg per day or every other day). The mean duration of follow up averaged 1.3 years per participant, ranging from 1.2 years in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK> to 1.5 years in <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>. The primary reported analysis was intention-to-treat in <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LASAF" TYPE="STUDY">LASAF</LINK>, while it was treatment-received (that is, on-therapy) in <LINK REF="STD-AFASAK-I" TYPE="STUDY">AFASAK I</LINK>, but intention-to-treat results for stroke were later published (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>For a sensitivity analysis, the <LINK REF="STD-SAFT" TYPE="STUDY">SAFT</LINK> trial (1995 to 2000) was included, in which AF patients were randomized to receive aspirin 75 mg per day plus warfarin 1.25 mg per day versus no antithrombotic treatment. Patients were recruited from multiple Swedish outpatient clinics. Mean participant age was 73 years, 37% were female, and follow up averaged 2.75 years per participant.</P>
<P>Two additional randomized trials testing APT in AF patients were not included. One tested indobufen, in which participants with non-valvular AF were not separately reported from a larger cohort with other types of heart disease (we have been unable to obtain this information from queries sent to the investigators) (<LINK REF="STD-Fornaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fornaro 1993</LINK>). The other, the Turkish Atrial Fibrillation Trial (<LINK REF="STD-TAFT" TYPE="STUDY">TAFT</LINK>), excluded 51% of randomized patients from the available published results and was not included due to potential bias resulting from exclusion of most of the participants.</P>

<P>The three trials included 1965 participants without previous stroke or TIA with a mean follow up of 1.3 years per participant, resulting in about 2560 patient years of observation. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between the included studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">All strokes (ischemic and hemorrhagic)</HEADING>
<P>Aspirin was associated with a trend toward reduction in all stroke (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.07) but pooled results of the three trials were not statistically significant. Including the SAFT trial, aspirin was associated with an OR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.00).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:18:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of non-valvular AF involving primary prevention, aspirin was associated with consistent, but modest reductions in stroke and other ischemic events that were of marginal statistical significance. Considering all available randomized data, it is likely that APT reduces stroke in AF patients, but this effect is relatively small. We regard the best estimate of the effect of aspirin on stroke in AF to be derived from all available randomized data combining trials of both primary and secondary prevention: about a 25% stroke reduction (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> trial results reported the largest stroke reduction by aspirin. <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> was stopped at an interim analysis due to the efficacy of aspirin, and consequently the efficacy estimate may be exaggerated. Further, analysis of <LINK REF="STD-SPAF-I" TYPE="STUDY">SPAF I</LINK> results showed the major effect of aspirin was on minor, non-disabling strokes which occurred with particular frequency in this trial, perhaps due to sensitive methods of stroke detection during close follow up. That the effect of aspirin in AF is primarily on non-disabling, non-cardioembolic strokes is supported by the only modest decrease in disabling or fatal strokes (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49) seen in these analyses.<BR/>
<BR/>No significant increases in hemorrhagic events were associated with aspirin use in these trials, but rates of major bleeding were low (less than 1% per year) and estimates of aspirin's effects were imprecise. Data from larger trials consistently show that aspirin, even in low doses, increase major extracranial hemorrhage and probably intracranial hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Ridker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridker 2005</LINK>). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is the most frequent site of aspirin-associated bleeding, and its rate is likely influenced by aspirin dose.</P>
<P>The trend toward reduction in stroke by APT that emerged from this analysis involving patients with non-valvular AF (about 20%) was similar to that seen in patients with arterial vascular disease (about 25%) reported by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). The pathophysiologic implications of this similarity of response invite speculation. Either stasis-precipitated atrial thrombi are partially prevented by APT, or such thrombi are less important in AF-associated stroke than previously hypothesized.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:19:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-22 12:19:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Aspirin likely reduces stroke and other major vascular events for those with non-valvular AF, but the effect is modest (about 20%). Adjusted-dose warfarin offers larger, more predictable reductions in stroke for AF patients who can safely receive it (<LINK REF="REF-van-Walraven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Walraven 2002</LINK>). Most guidelines recommend adjusted-dose warfarin for AF patients at high risk for stroke and aspirin for those deemed at low risk or for those who cannot safely receive adjusted-dose warfarin. Stroke risk stratification schemes have been developed and validated for AF patients that allow reliable classification of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Gage-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gage 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Go-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2003</LINK>). The threshold of benefit that would warrant anticoagulation remains controversial and depends on patient preferences and availability of optimal anticoagulation monitoring. In most cohorts of AF patients without prior stroke or TIA, 30% to 50% have sufficiently low stroke rate during APT therapy that the absolute benefits of anticoagulation would be small (that is, less than 1% per year) (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2003</LINK>). While less efficacious than oral anticoagulants, APT has a role for prevention of stroke and vascular events in selected AF patients at relatively low risk.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More randomized data about the efficacy of non-aspirin APT regimens (including dipyridamole, clopidogrel and indobufen, alone and combined with aspirin) might allow more effective use of APT in AF patients. </P>
