<P>Scrub typhus is transmitted by chiggers (mites), is a bacterial infection and causes fever and a typical sore on the skin, and is common in the western Pacific region and many parts of Asia, particularly in agricultural workers and travellers in areas where the disease is common, particularly people camping, rafting, or trekking . This review summarize the information from seven small trials about the effects of antibiotics on scrub typhus. Most of the antibiotics tested worked: this includes: doxycycline, tetracycline, telithromycin and azithromycin. Rifampicin seem to be more effective than doxycycline in areas where scrub typhus appears to respond poorly to standard anti-rickettsial drugs. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-16 03:51:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scrub typhus is a bacterial disease caused by <I>Rickettsia tsutsugamushi</I> (<I>Orientia tsutsugamushi</I>). It is transmitted by larval <I>Leptotrombidium</I> mites, which are commonly called chiggers. Infection can cause widespread inflammation of the blood vessels in many organs, especially the lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Silpapojakul-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silpapojakul 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with scrub typhus develop fever, headache, and a cough. Uncommonly patients develop a characteristic skin lesion, called an eschar (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sirisanthana-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirisanthana 1989</LINK>), which makes the diagnosis much more likely. The eschar occurs at the site of the bite, starts as a large pimple ('papule'), and then the centre part of the skin dies and turns black, giving it the appearance of a cigarette burn. Laboratory tests are not widely available: the Weil-Felix test (with Proteus OX-K) is insensitive (<LINK REF="REF-Sirisanthana-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirisanthana 1989</LINK>), and serodiagnostic tests are only available in reference centres.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Incidence</HEADING>
<P>Scrub typhus is common in the western Pacific region and many parts of Asia. It is listed as one of the differential diagnoses of fever of unknown origin in people in endemic areas. In Thailand, some estimates suggest that 10% of people with fever have scrub typhus (<LINK REF="REF-Silpapojakul-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silpapojakul 1997</LINK>). A seroprevalence study among 200 febrile people attending some malaria clinics in western Thailand has indicated that 59.5% had serology (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG)) positive for scrub typhus infection (<LINK REF="REF-Chanyasanha-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanyasanha 1998</LINK>). A study conducted in five hospitals in Thailand among patients with undifferentiated febrile illness without focal infection showed that 19.9% had serology positive for scrub typhus (<LINK REF="REF-Suttinont-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suttinont 2006</LINK>). A study among 207 hospitalized patients with febrile illness of 5 to 30 days duration in Southern India indicated that 24% had elevated IgM antibodies of scrub typhus (<LINK REF="REF-Varghese-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varghese 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk Factors</HEADING>
<P>The risk of scrub typhus is closely related to occupation. Most cases in Asia are acquired through agricultural exposure to oil palm and rubber plantations in Malaysia, or rice fields in Thailand. Scrub typhus is also associated with travel activities such as camping, rafting, or trekking in endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Silpapojakul-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silpapojakul 1997</LINK>). A number of cases have been reported in 'eco-travellers' from Europe and America (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watt 1994</LINK>). Recently, three cases from Scandinavia were reported from infections acquired in Thailand, Laos, and Sri Lanka respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Jensenius-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensenius 2006</LINK>). In addition, scrub typhus is an important disease in military personnel undertaking field duties in endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Deller-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deller 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1973</LINK>). Severe, life threatening scrub typhus has also been reported in neonates as a result of the infection being transmitted from their mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suntharasaj-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suntharasaj 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prognosis and treatment</HEADING>
<P>The severity of the disease is thought to depend on the virulence of the Rickettsia strain, the patient's age and genetic factors, and whether the person has previously been infected. The outbreak of scrub typhus in India reported 17.2%(19/113) mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2004</LINK>). Antibiotic treatment is thought to shorten the illness and reduce mortality. It is usually presumptive, being given to febrile individuals where the disease is endemic. Chloramphenicol was the first drug described in a series of studies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Smadel-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smadel 1950</LINK>). Tetracycline and doxycycline have also been used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data from case series</HEADING>
<P>To evaluate information about treatment from case series, we systematically searched for case series of people treated for scrub typhus. The search was carried out in 2000, and the results summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. In one study involving 42 adults treated with a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline, 88% became afebrile and all clinical symptoms disappeared within 72 hours, and no relapses occurred in the month following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Supparatpinyo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Supparatpinyo 1990</LINK>). In children, a good response to tetracycline and chloramphenicol treatment was described in 25 cases, who all became afebrile in 48 hours. Relapse occurred in two children and fever subsided spontaneously in one of them within four days (<LINK REF="REF-Sirisanthana-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirisanthana 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a case series from Chiangrai, northern Thailand, a poor response to a 7-day course of doxycycline was reported; only 5/12 (40%) patients were afebrile at 72 hours. Moreover, the result of doxycycline susceptibility testing in mouse fibroblast cell culture showed that only 39% of the patients had strains that were fully susceptible to doxycycline (<LINK REF="REF-Watt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watt 1996</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The new macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, was recently evaluated in vitro against <I>R. tsutsugamushi</I>. Azithromycin was effective against some strains of <I>R. tsutsugamushi</I>, particularly doxycycline-resistant strains. Azithromycin is considered safer than other antibiotics for use in young children and pregnant women. It has advantages over chloramphenicol, which occasionally causes bone marrow suppression, and tetracycline, which affects the growing bones and teeth of children and foetuses (<LINK REF="REF-Strickman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strickman 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Current debates</HEADING>
<P>Tetracycline or chloramphenicol are generally recommended (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>). However, the potential advantage of alternative drugs (azithromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin) has not been directly established; and length of treatment to prevent recrudescence is not clear. This review aims to summarize the information about the effects of various classes of antibiotics on scrub typhus.</P>

We recorded which people were blinded, such as the participants, care providers, or assessors. We considered the inclusion of all randomized participants in the analysis to be adequate if it was greater than or equal to 90% and inadequate if less than 90%. We displayed this information in a table and described it in the text. We resolved inconsistencies through discussion. Both authors participated in the assessment.</P>

<P>We assessed heterogeneity by visually examining the forest plot and through the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity using a 10% level of statistical significance, and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to measure inconsistency of results among trials (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In the event of heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using the following subgroups: (1) type of antibiotic; (2) dose and length of administration; and (3) whether the trial was conducted before or after antibiotic resistance had been reported. After testing for heterogeneity, the pooled measures were ultimately computed using the random-effects model.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sheehy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehy 1973</LINK> reported on military servicemen who acquired scrub typhus in Vietnam, and were evacuated "at random" to one of two military hospitals. Participants were recruited in 1966 although the study was not published until 1973. It is not entirely clear whether it was the evacuation that was random or the hospital allocation; pending clarification, we have included the study. A total of 63 participants were enrolled, and three with malaria were then excluded. Participants evacuated to hospital A were given chloramphenicol (n = 30), and those to hospital B were given tetracycline (n = 30); both groups were followed up for three weeks. The outcomes measured by the researchers were participants afebrile by 48 hours, and duration of fever.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1978</LINK> enrolled 149 adult participants in Malaysia presumed to have scrub typhus. They were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline or tetracycline. In their analysis, the authors then excluded participants with no serological evidence of infection, or participants with serological changes but a co-infection. This left 55 participants (doxycycline n = 31; tetracycline n = 24) with clinical and serological evidence of scrub typhus infection. The outcomes measured by the researchers were disappearance of symptoms, participants afebrile by 48 hours, and any adverse drug effects.</P>

The outcomes measured by the researchers were failure of treatment and relapse.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK> enrolled 126 adult participants in Thailand who were diagnosed with mild scrub typhus. They were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline, rifampicin, or combined regimen of rifampicin and doxycycline. During the first year of the study there were a number of participants in one arm of the study who had protracted fever more frequently than the others. This led the researchers to perform an interim analysis. The fever clearance time was significantly different between the three treatment groups: 88 hours (n = 8); 35 hours (n = 5); and 24 hours (n = 9). They decided to break the code of the group with the 88 hours clearance time and found that it was a combination group. This regimen was discontinued and participants subsequently recruited to this group were assigned high dose rifampicin (900 mg/day). During the study, the authors excluded participants with adverse treatment effects and those who had illness other than scrub typhus. In their analysis, the participants who had no serological evidence of infection were excluded. This left 78 participants (doxycycline n = 28; standard rifampicin dose n = 26 and high rifampicin dose n = 24). The outcomes measured were duration of fever, participants febrile at 48 hours, relapse, and side effects.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK> enrolled 99 adult participants in Korea diagnosed mild scrub typhus on the basis of clinical criteria. They were randomly assigned to receive either azithromycin or doxycycline. The authors excluded four participants confirmed to have combined infection with other disease, one participant who developed severe vomiting and one participant who was given the wrong dose of medication. This left 93 participants (azithromycin n = 47; Doxycycline n = 46) with clinical evidence of scrub typhus infection. Both groups were followed up for 30 days.The outcomes measured by the researchers were time to defervescence, cure, failure, relapse and adverse drug effects.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK> conducted a multicenter study in Korea, and enrolled 95 adult patients with possible scrub typhus. Of these, three had concurrent diseases and was excluded. The left 92 participants were randomly allocated to either telithromycin (n = 47) or doxycycline (n = 45) group, and followed up for four weeks. Seventy-six out of the 92 participants met diagnostic laboratory criteria of scrub typhus. The outcomes measured by the researchers were fever clearance time, cure, failure, relapse, toxicity and adverse events.</P>

Generation of allocation sequence was adequate in three trials, and one trial had adequate allocation concealment; follow up was classed as adequate in four trials; no trial had blinding.</P>
<P>The method of random allocation was not clear in <LINK REF="STD-Sheehy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehy 1973</LINK>. The diagnosis of scrub typhus was based on clinical criteria, and only 19/60 participants were tested using the Weil-Felix test with Proteus OX-K agglutinins. This test was the only one available at this time, but is not specific for the disease. While all participants received drugs for at least three days, the total length of treatment was decided by clinicians and not reported. All participants were followed up for three weeks.</P>
<P>The random allocation was not clear in <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1978</LINK>, but entry criteria were more rigorously applied.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-16 03:51:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several trials of scrub typhus treatment with antibiotics. The diagnostic criteria for scrub typhus in <LINK REF="STD-Sheehy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehy 1973</LINK> study was based on mostly clinical features, so it is not clear how many participants actually had scrub typhus. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Song-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1995</LINK>) had more strictly laboratory diagnostic criteria, although the Weil-Felix test with Proteus OX-K is relatively insensitive. In <LINK REF="STD-Watt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 2000</LINK>, a serological dipstick test was used to screen mild scrub typhus for enrolment. The researchers then conducted a separate test to confirm the diagnosis. This led to some participants being excluded from the study after randomization. The other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phimda-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Phimda 2007</LINK>) were based on WHO criteria to screen mild scrub typhus for enrolment. In Kim 2004 and Kim 2007, among participants who completed the treatment, not all of them were confirmed scrub typhus, however, the intention to treat analysis was performed based on participants who complete the treatment.</P>
<P>The uncertainty around diagnosis causes problems in clinical decision making, as well as in evaluating antibiotics. It appears in these studies participants with other infectious diseases were excluded, increasing the certainty of the diagnosis, but this remains a problem until better tests are more widely available.</P>
<P>The concealment of allocation was poorly reported, and only one study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Phimda-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Phimda 2007</LINK>) reported adequate allocation concealment. Studies were small. Three recent studies used intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phimda-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Phimda 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, broad spectrum antibiotics are known to be effective in this condition, but trials are currently insufficient to determine whether and under what conditions one is more effective than another.</P>

<P>The antibiotics tested appear to cure the condition, and there seem to be little to choose between the broad spectrum antibiotics tested, but trials are small.</P>
<P>Rifampicin seem to be more effective than doxycycline in areas where scrub typhus appears to respond poorly to conventional antibiotics (tetracycline and chloramphenical), and where doxycycline-resistance strain is suspected.</P>
<P>Clinicians should monitor the progress of patients in the light of reports of drug resistance.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-12-29 05:43:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is required to evaluate antibiotics for scrub typhus. Trials would be more easily interpreted if reliable diagnostic tests were available. Such research could examine whether a single dose of doxycycline is as effective as a three to five day course of treatment.</P>
<P>Regimens for severe disease need to be evaluated, for example, comparing intravenous chloramphenicol with intravenous tetracycline.</P>
<P>Studies are also needed to evaluate alternative antibiotics, particularly in areas where scrub typhus appears to respond poorly to conventional antibiotics.</P>
