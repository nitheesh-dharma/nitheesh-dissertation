<P>There is not enough evidence about the effects of amniotomy alone (deliberate rupture of the membranes) to induce labour.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is advisable to get labour started (induction) because of concerns about either the pregnant woman or her unborn baby. Amniotomy has been used as either the only method of inducing labour if the membranes can be reached, or used with drugs such as oxytocin or prostaglandin. Amniotomy may be preferred by women wanting a drug-free labour and it is cheap. However, it can be uncomfortable and, if after amniotomy there is a long time interval before the baby is born, there is a risk of infection. There is also the risk of the cord coming out before the baby. This review of trials found that there is not enough evidence about the effects of amniotomy alone for the induction of labour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Amniotomy (deliberate rupture of the membranes) is a simple procedure which can be used alone for induction of labour if the membranes are accessible, thus avoiding the need for pharmacological intervention.

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials, comprising 50 and 260 women, respectively were eligible for inclusion in this review. No conclusions could be drawn from comparisons of amniotomy alone versus no intervention, and amniotomy alone versus oxytocin alone (small trial, only one pre-specified outcome reported). No trials compared amniotomy alone with intracervical prostaglandins. One trial compared amniotomy alone with a single dose of vaginal prostaglandins for women with a favourable cervix, and found a significant increase in the need for oxytocin augmentation in the amniotomy alone group (44% versus 15%; relative risk 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.82 to 4.46). This should be viewed with caution as this was the result of a single-centre trial. Furthermore, secondary intervention occurred four hours after amniotomy, and this time interval may not have been appropriate. </P>

<P>Data are lacking about the value of amniotomy alone for induction of labour. While there are now other modern methods available for induction of labour (pharmacological agents), there remain clinical scenarios where amniotomy alone may be desirable and appropriate, and this method is worthy of further research. This research should include evaluation of the appropriate time interval from amniotomy to secondary intervention, women and caregivers' satisfaction and economic analysis.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-23 14:33:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Induction of labour is a common obstetric intervention which is usually undertaken for a clinical indication (for example concerns about fetal wellbeing, post term pregnancy). It may also, rightly or wrongly, be undertaken for other reasons, such as a woman's request or clinician's convenience.</P>
<P>Amniotomy, i.e. deliberate artificial rupture of the membranes, was first described over 200 years ago by Thomas Denman of the Middlesex Hospital in the United Kingdom. This procedure is performed vaginally, whereby the clinician identifies the cervix and membranes digitally, introduces the instrument to be used and pierces the membranes. The instrument most commonly used is a specially designed plastic hook, but sometimes steel surgical forceps are used. The procedure itself is not painful as there are no nerve endings on the membranes, and anaesthesia is not required, however, the vaginal examination required to gain access to the cervix and membranes may be uncomfortable, and in some cases painful, particularly if the membranes are difficult to reach. </P>
<P>Amniotomy may be performed during labour for various clinical reasons, such as failure to progress in the first stage of labour and need to assess the status of the liquor in the presence of fetal heart rate abnormalities. In the past it has been advocated in combination with oxytocin for the active management of labour (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1973</LINK>). However, a systematic review of 9 trials entitled 'amniotomy for shortening spontaneous labour' (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2000</LINK>), concluded that it is associated with both benefit and risk and that it should be reserved for women with abnormal labour progress. In particular although it may reduce the length of spontaneous labour and the need for oxytocin augmentation, there is a trend toward an increase in the caesarean section rate. </P>
<P>It may also be employed prelabour as the sole method of induction of labour or in combination with the use of pharmacological agents for induction of labour, such as oxytocin or prostaglandins. Theoretically, amniotomy releases endogenous prostaglandins which in turn may result in cervical changes and spontaneous labour. A rise in prostaglandin metabolites following amniotomy has been demonstrated and the concentration does seem to be related to the induction-delivery interval (<LINK REF="REF-Husslein-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husslein 1983</LINK>). </P>
<P>This procedure is only possible if the membranes are physically accessible. Even if the cervix is unfavourable (low Bishop's score), the membranes may be accessible. Potential hazards associated with amniotomy include cord prolapse if the presenting part is high at the time of the procedure and when the membranes have been breeched, the fetal environment is vulnerable to ascending infection. Indeed, infective agents can be introduced at the time of amniotomy and during subsequent vaginal examinations. Amniotomy for induction of labour may be contraindicated in the presence of known HIV positivity as duration of membrane rupture has been identified as an independent risk factor for mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Landesman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landesman 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Booth found approximately 88% of women with a favourable Bishop's score will labour after amniotomy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Booth-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth 1970</LINK>). However the amniotomy to labour interval may be long, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Saleh-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saleh 1975</LINK> reported in a prospective observational study of amniotomy versus amniotomy and early intravenous oxytocin infusion, significantly more women undelivered after 24 hours in the amniotomy alone group. The long amniotomy to labour interval may not be acceptable to women and/or clinicians, particularly in view of the risk of ascending infection, and if there is a clinical indication for induction favouring labour and delivery without unnecessary delay. Of course, labour may not ensue, even after a prolonged interval, in which case pharmacological agents would be indicated. </P>
<P>In modern day obstetric practice amniotomy is more commonly used in combination with pharmacological agents for induction of labour. However, knowledge of its efficacy as an induction method remains valuable for a number of reasons. In countries where resources are limited, it may be worthwhile as a first line induction method, to avoid using expensive pharmacological agents. In some situations where the woman prefers to avoid pharmacological intervention if at all possible, it could be employed initially, and pharmacological agents introduced, if after a specified time interval, labour does not ensue. In women with a previous caesarean section it may be advantageous to avoid pharmacological uterine stimulation.</P>

<P>Clinical trials comparing amniotomy alone for cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction (see 'Methods of the review'); the trials included some form of random allocation to either group; and they reported one or more of the prestated outcomes.

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Amniotomy alone compared with placebo/no treatment or any other method above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction. It was intended that comparisons with three methods, which are placed above amniotomy alone on a predefined list, would be included in this review as follows:<BR/>(i) vaginal prostaglandins;<BR/>(ii) intracervical prostaglandins;<BR/>(iii) oxytocin alone.</P>
<P>For details of the predefined list of induction methods please refer to 'Methods of the review'.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-08-28 16:03:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion amongst registered Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth reviewers with an interest in labour induction.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. subgroup analyses will be limited to the primary outcomes:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours;<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. It was intended that the incidence of individual components be explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of effectiveness:</HEADING>
<P>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12-24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<P>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects (all)<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of satisfaction:</HEADING>
<P>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (&gt;5 contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short term variability).</P>
<P>One non-prespecified outcome is included in the analysis tables, namely, antibiotics given to baby.</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<P>A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This strategy was developed as the result of a collaboration between the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK. Many methods have been studied, in many different categories of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged by category of woman, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We have therefore developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was done in a series of primary reviews (including this review) arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The data will then be extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by category of woman.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, for example, this review (5) was to include only comparisons with intravenous oxytocin (4) intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<P>Each time a primary review is updated with new data, those secondary reviews which include data which have changed, will also be updated.</P>
<P>The trials included in the primary reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (see above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of the Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous reviewers in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels were sought.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention to treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis was performed if possible). If data were missing, clarification would have been sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data would have been excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the reviewers of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If there were missing data which later became available, they would have been included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data would have been extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting is poor, methodological issues would have been reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual reviewers for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 1999</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed effects model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis include all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were to be analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<P>Seven potential trials were identified.</P>
<P>Five excluded trials:</P>
<P>Three studies were excluded because they did not report any of the pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Sivasuriya-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Sivasuriya 1978</LINK> evaluated the association between three methods of induction of labour and neonatal jaundice. <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 1989</LINK> determined oxytocin concentration in women undergoing amniotomy for induction of labour. <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1991</LINK> is a conference abstract which presents a randomised trial of three methods of induction, but does not contain any data for extraction relating to the outcome measures sought.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Secher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Secher 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westergaard-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Westergaard 1983</LINK>) are methodologically good randomised trials of prostaglandins versus oxytocin for induction of labour, in two subgroups of women, namely those with favourable cervix where amniotomy alone was performed prior to randomisation and those with unfavourable cervix where amniotomy was not performed prior to randomisation. Therefore amniotomy was not randomised, but pragmatically allocated, thus rendering these trials not eligible for inclusion in this review. They will, however be considered for other relevant primary induction of labour reviews.</P>
<P>Two included trials:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jagani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jagani 1982</LINK> is a small pseudo-randomised trial comprising 50 women which aimed to evaluate whether alteration of the cervix affects the ability to induce labour if the cervix was unfavourable (Bishop's score is 4 or less). There were five subgroups, each of 10 women, namely (1) control (no intervention); (2) laminaria; (3) foley catheter; (4) amniotomy; and (5) oxytocin with intact membranes, to which women were allocated by chart number. After 12 hours of the allocated intervention, amniotomy and oxytocin were employed to induce labour. The analysis aimed to evaluate whether any of the primary interventions improved the Bishop's score and the ability to induce labour, as well as reduce the induction to delivery interval.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1995</LINK> is a randomised trial comparing a single dose of vaginal prostaglandin E2 gel (primiparae 2 mg, multiparae 1 mg) with forewater amniotomy for induction of labour at term in 260 women with a favourable cervix (Bishop's score 6 or greater). In the prostaglandin group amniotomy was performed four hours after insertion of the gel or sooner if analgesia requested. In the amniotomy group review was undertaken four hours after amniotomy and oxytocin commenced if there was no uterine activity and/or no change in cervical status. In both groups at six hours oxytocin was commenced if there was evidence of unsatisfactory uterine activity.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jagani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jagani 1982</LINK> used chart numbers and hence pseudo-randomised (inadequate concealment allocation). Blinding of the patient and the therapist was not feasible in this trial. It is unclear whether the outcome assessor or analyst were blinded to the initial intervention. Analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis and there were no losses to follow up, thus reducing attrition bias. This trial was small with only 10 women in each of the subgroups and therefore unlikely to produce meaningful results. Furthermore, only three of the prespecified outcomes were reported, two of which were not reported in absolute figures (but as mean and standard deviations) and thus the data were not usable for this review.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1995</LINK> was very well designed. Following a retrospective audit for pilot data, a power calculation was undertaken to determine the required sample size. The method of randomisation was consecutive numbered sealed opaque envelopes which contained allocation from a table of random numbers (adequate concealment allocation). Blinding to reduce performance and detection bias was unfeasible. Analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis, there were no reported protocol violations and no losses to follow up, thus reducing attrition bias. In the amniotomy alone group, further intervention occurred at four hours (i.e. oxytocin if labour not established), and this arbitrary time interval is important, as it is possible that the longer a women is left with ruptured membranes, the more likely labour will ensue without the need for intervention. However, the 'ideal' time interval is not known. </P>

<P>There was a significant increase in oxytocin augmentation in the amniotomy alone group compared with the vaginal prostaglandin group (44% versus 15%; RR 2.85, 95% CI 1.82 to 4.46).

There was a non-significant increase in epidural analgesia in the amniotomy alone group (13% versus 7%; RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.08), particularly amongst primiparae (18% versus 6%; RR 3.33, 95% CI 0.97 to 11.46). There was a non-significant increase in intrapartum maternal pyrexia in the amniotomy alone group (7% versus 4%; RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.23).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Presumably, amniotomy alone is widely used for induction of labour, particularly in countries where resources are scarce, yet there is surprisingly little research in this area. Due to the paucity of trials, firm conclusions cannot be drawn about amniotomy alone for induction of labour. Furthermore one of the two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jagani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jagani 1982</LINK>) reported only one of the prespecified outcomes (caesarean section), thus compounding this lack of data. </P>
<P>The only trial which reported a number of the pre-specified outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1995</LINK>) was well designed. The only significant finding was the increased need for oxytocin augmentation following amniotomy alone versus a single dose of vaginal prostaglandin in women with a favourable cervix. However, this finding would ideally need to be validated in other clinical settings and different populations. Furthermore, as secondary intervention occurred four hours after amniotomy, it could be argued that if a longer time interval was allowed this difference may not have arisen, as the longer allowed from amniotomy to intervention, the more likely labour would ensue. The nonsignificant differences in the amniotomy alone group towards an increase in epidural analgesia (particularly amongst primiparae), intrapartum maternal pyrexia, meconium-stained liquor (amongst primiparae) are interesting but not conclusive. The contrast in incidence of postpartum haemorrhage amongst primiparae (nonsignificant increase) versus multiparae (nonsignificant decrease) is difficult to interpret and may be meaningless, and a chance effect.</P>
<P>With such small numbers it is impossible to comment on implications for perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality, as trials or meta-analysis of large power are required (thousands of participants). </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-23 14:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Data on the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for induction of labour are lacking. No recommendations for clinical practice can be made on the basis of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-05-23 14:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there are numerous pharmacological methods for induction of labour, the clinical effectiveness and safety of which will be reported in other primary reviews, there are scenarios where amniotomy alone may be favoured. For example, in clinical settings where resources are limited and cost savings on pharmacological agents may be welcomed, and if an individual woman is not keen on pharmacological intervention. In women with previous caesarean section, avoiding pharmacological uterine stimulation may be advantageous. Therefore, we feel it is reasonable to recommend that further research into the method of amniotomy alone for induction of labour is needed, and would urge researchers to evaluate this method in the context of different time intervals between the primary (amniotomy alone) and secondary intervention (addition of a pharmacological agent). This research should include assessment of women and caregiver satisfaction and economic analysis.</P>

<P>Conference abstract. In this study, women were randomly allocated to one of three groups: prostaglandin gel; amniotomy alone, and amniotomy with oxytocin infusion. No primary outcomes relevant to this review reported. The authors comment on the potential advantages of prostaglandin in reducing the need for intravenous oxytocin and thus allowing women to mobilise more readily in early labour. These potential advantages in terms of consumer satisfaction were not evaluated formally, but merely speculated upon.</P>
