<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-25 14:46:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHLs) are fast growing forms of lymphoma. The most common type is a diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLCL) but there are several other subtypes of aggressive lymphoma and variants of DLCL, such as centroblastic, immunoblastic or anaplastic large B-Cell lymphoma. Aggressive NHLs are generally responsive to conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the 1980s, many researchers reported that some patients with diffuse, large-cell lymphoma, who had not responded to conventional chemotherapy, could be cured with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. This techniques may be used to treat the cancer, because the high doses of chemotherapy can destroy the patient's bone marrow. Therefore stem cells or marrow is taken from the patient before treatment. The marrow or the stem cells are then frozen, and the patient is given high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy to treat the cancer. The marrow or the stem cells that were taken out is then thawed and given back through a needle in a vein to replace the marrow that was destroyed. This type of transplant is called an autologous transplant. If the marrow given is taken from another person, the transplant is called an allogeneic transplant.On the first decade of study into autologous transplantation for the treatment of aggressive lymphoma, the focus was on the use of this approach to rescue patients after relapse or if the disease already progressed under standard chemotherapy. These encouraging results in relapsed or progressive lymphoma led to the testing of the technique as a primary therapy for the disease. However, it was also important to identify factors that could predict outcome of the therapy for patients with aggressive lymphoma. The International Prognostic Index score (IPI) was established in 1993. This score was designed to better predict outcome of aggressive lymphoma. Based on the number of negative prognostic factors present at the time of diagnosis (age &gt;60 years, stage III/IV disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status &gt; 2, more than one extranodal site of disease) four outcome groups (low-risk, low-intermediate risk, high-intermediate risk and high-risk ) were identified with a 5-year overall survival ranging from 26% to 73%.</P>
<P>In the last few years, several randomised trials of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with autologous transplantation in patients with aggressive lymphoma have been reported. These studies have included incorporation of autotransplantation into the initial treatment, use of adjuvant autotransplantation in complete responders, and the use of this treatment approach in patients responding slowly or incompletely to their primary chemotherapy regimen. In this trials conflicting results of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation as part of first-line treatment have been reported. A few studies indicated a trend towards a better survival for patients with a poor prognosis according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index score, whereas others failed to show an advantage for primary high-dose chemotherapy. Therefore we undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of such treatment on overall survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</P>
<P>The main results from this analysis are:<BR/>(i) In general, there was no evidence that HDT improves overall survival (OS) (HR 1.05; CI 0.92 to 1.19) or event free survival (EFS) (HR 0.92; CI 0.80 to 1.05).<BR/>(ii) In patients with good risk aaIPI there was some evidence for worse OS (HR 1.46; CI 1.02 to 2.09) when treated with HDT.<BR/>(iii) In contrast, there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence that poor risk patients may benefit from HDT.</P>
<P>Overall, with respect to the large population included in our analyses and the attempts made to minimise bias and confounding, we conclude that there is no evidence for a general benefit of the therapeutic principle of myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with aggressive NHL as first-line treatment based on the data presently available.</P>
<P>We have seen improvements for relapse free survival and complete remission rates but this was not translated into a benefit concerning the OS in the respective groups.</P>
<P>Most importantly, IPI low-risk patients appear to be harmed by high-dose chemotherapy in first-line treatment: patients. Furthermore with the availability of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab good risk patients will have a better overall outcome after a combined conventional immunochemotherapy. However, if HDT is employed for high risk patients, there may be a benefit, but physicians should not arbitrarily employ HDT during first-line treatment. There is a strong need to treat this group of high-risk patients in large trials with harmonized procedures and definitions, which would facilitate the comparability of results, and improve the assessment of therapeutic intervention. Further research should aim at either reproducing the studies showing positive trends or applying new approaches that do not solely rely on the principle of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDT) has been proven effective in relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, conflicting results of HDT as part of first-line treatment have been reported in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of such treatment.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as part of first-line treatment improves survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-04-03 16:11:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cancer Lit, the Cochrane Library and smaller databases, Internet-databases of ongoing trials, conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology were searched until September 2006. An update search in MEDLINE and CENTRAL was done in June 2010, no more trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified. We included full-text, abstract publications and unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing conventional chemotherapy versus high-dose chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of adults with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma were included in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility and quality assessment, data extraction and analysis were done in duplicate. All authors were contacted to obtain missing data and asked to provide individual patient data.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-25 14:42:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Fifteen RCTs including 3079 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Overall treatment-related mortality was 6.0% in the HDT group and not significantly different compared to conventional chemotherapy (OR 1.33 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.93], P = 0.14). 13 studies including 2018 patients showed significantly higher CR rates in the group receiving HDT (OR 1.32, [95% CI 1.09 to 1.59], P = 0.004). However, HDT did not have an effect on OS, when compared to conventional chemotherapy. The pooled HR was 1.04 ([95% CI 0.91 to 1.18], P = 0.58). There was no statistical heterogeneity among the trials. Sensitivity analyses underlined the robustness of these results. Subgroup analysis of prognostic groups according to IPI did not show any survival difference between HDT and controls in 12 trials (low and low-intermediate risk IPI: HR 1.41[95% CI 0.95 to 2.10], P = 0.09; high-intermediate and high risk IPI: HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.13], P = 0.71. Event-free survival (EFS) also showed no significant difference between HDT and CT (HR 0.93, [95% CI 0.81 to 1.07], P = 0.31). Other possible risk factors such as the proportion of patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma, protocol adherence, HDT strategy, response status before HDT, conditioning regimens and methodological issues were analysed in sensitivity analyses. However, there was no evidence for an association between these factors and the results of our analyses.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>.<BR/>Despite higher CR rates, there is no benefit for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment in patients with aggressive NHL.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-25 14:49:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Since the standard chemotherapy regimen CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) was established in 1976 (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McKelvey-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKelvey 1976</LINK>), there has been no substantial improvement in the prognosis of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Complete remission rates and long-term survival rates with CHOP are about 55% and 30% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Agthoven-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agthoven 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Project-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Project 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>). The role of Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against surface antigen CD20, either combined with conventional chemotherapy or with high-dose chemotherapy is still under investigation.<BR/>Several so called third-generation regimens include new agents and different doses and are based on the CHOP backbone. These regimens showed encouraging results in pilot studies. However, three large randomised studies failed to show an improvement in disease-free or overall survival when compared with the CHOP-regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1993</LINK>).<BR/>According to the Norton-Simon-hypothesis, relapses are not only caused by resistant tumour cells (genetic resistance), but also by tumour cells with reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (kinetic resistance) (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1982</LINK>). According to this hypothesis, an intensification of chemotherapy with non-cross reacting agents applied after the induction therapy should lead to higher cure rates. With the development of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and the increasing feasibility of this approach by improved supportive care, this hypothesis was tested in clinical trials. For patients who relapsed after conventional chemotherapy a significant benefit could be demonstrated when receiving HDT and ASCT as salvage therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Philip-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philip 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Therefore eradicating the disease at an earlier time point or during first-line therapy might be promising approach sparing a later salvage treatment. Although the initial results of uncontrolled trials using HDT as first-line treatment in aggressive NHL were encouraging (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nademanee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nademanee 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nademanee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nademanee 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vitolo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitolo 1997</LINK>), several randomised controlled studies showed no significant survival benefit of this approach for the majority of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>).<BR/>However, a few studies indicated a trend towards a better survival for patients with a poor prognosis according to the International Prognostic Index score (IPI) that was established in 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-Project-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Project 1993</LINK>). This score was designed to further clarify lymphoma staging. Based on the number of negative prognostic factors present at the time of diagnosis (age &gt; 60 years, stage III/IV disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status <U>&gt;</U> 2, more than one extranodal site of disease, four discrete outcome groups were identified with a 5-year overall survival ranging from 26% to 73%.<BR/>The modified age-adjusted IPI score was defined for patients less than 60 years and comprises three factors (performance status, stage and LDH) and also four risk groups. As the feasibility of the HDT approach for older patients was quite unknown, most conducted trials only included younger patients and subsequently applied the age-adjusted score. The randomised LNH87-2 trial demonstrated no difference in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival between patients in complete remission who received conventional therapy or HDT (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>). But in a retrospective analysis, the same investigators suggested an improvement for the subgroup of patients with high-intermediate and high risk IPI (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun-_x0028_subgroup_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun (subgroup)</LINK>).<BR/>The best strategy for the application of HDT is still unclear and subsequently varied among trials. Some trials applied HDT after a reduced number of standard-dose chemotherapy cycles. Others after a full standard-dose regimen or employed a sequence of two or three single drugs in a high but non-myeloablative dose, followed by myeloablative polychemotherapy, named high-dose sequential chemotherapy. Additionally, investigated patient populations differed between trials. Some investigators assumed best efficacy for patients who do respond only slowly to standard chemotherapy, others for patients who achieved a complete remission. Subsequently these investigators randomised patients in complete or partial remission only, respectively.<BR/>Single studies are often underpowered. In addition the randomly assigned patients often do not receive the intended therapy, which further diminishes the ability of a single trial to show differences between treatment strategies when using an intention to treat analysis.<BR/>By systematically reviewing the literature, identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pooling individual patient data where possible, this meta-analysis tries to summarize the current evidence for the role of HDT in first-line therapy for patients with aggressive NHL. This also includes the assessment of the impact of different subgroups derived from the IPI score, different HDT strategies, and different remission status of patients receiving HDT. For this individual patient data (IPD) concerning age adjusted outcomes (aaIPI) were requested from the authors of the included trials and a limited IPD analysis was performed next to the conventional meta-analysis.<BR/>Two meta-analyses addressing the same question have been published previously (<LINK REF="REF-Simnett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simnett 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Strehl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehl 2003</LINK>). Neither found clear evidence for the usage of HDT. These analyses did not include all RCTs and neither used hazard ratios or individual patient data to analyse time to event data. The odds ratios used in the previous analyses are based on cumulative death rates at one particular time point and are considered to favour the risk of biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Duchateau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duchateau 2001</LINK>). We therefore decided to systematically review the literature, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and to pool the results of individual studies and in case of availability individual patient data to summarize the current evidence for the role of HDT in first-line therapy for patients with aggressive NHL. Therefore we contacted authors to provide us with individual patient data for evaluation of overall survival according to the aaIPI.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of high-dose chemotherapy regimens plus autologous stem cell transplantation for treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with regard to tumour response and survival and to identify potential modifying effects of poor prognosis features, older age, type of transplant (early vs. late) or type of induction (standard vs. escalated) on this association.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials. Quasi-randomised studies, e.g. alternate treatment allocation or allocation by date of birth, were excluded as we consider this study design to be of poor quality leading to unreliable study results. Studies with less than 20 adult lymphoma patients in each study group were excluded. Abstracts and unpublished data were included, if sufficient information on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes was available. Otherwise they were excluded or included with reservations following discussion with all the review authors.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adult patients (aged &gt; 16) diagnosed with an aggressive malignant Non-Hodgkin lymphoma as defined by a clinical classification (<LINK REF="REF-Hiddemann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiddemann 1996</LINK>) and histological criteria. The following histological classifications were accepted: Working Formulation, Kiel-, REAL- and WHO-classification.</P>
<P>In detail, the following histological entities were included: diffuse large cell lymphoma, large cell anaplastic lymphoma (Ki-1 lymphoma), follicular lymphoma grade III, centroblastic lymphoma, immunoblastic lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic and angiocentric lymphoma, unspecified T-cell lymphoma, pleomorphic lymphoma, mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. These entities are termed "high-grade lymphoma" in the Kiel classification and "high-grade" or "intermediate grade" in the Working Formulation. <BR/>Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma, which are called "very aggressive" due to the Hiddemann-classification, were excluded as these diseases are often treated within the studies that cover acute leukaemia. After the review of the included studies, it became apparent, that often very aggressive lymphoma patients were also included. As their numbers were small and it was impossible to exclude these patients from our pooled analysis, we ignored this fact.<BR/>Plasmocytoma and multiple myeloma were also excluded as this is a separate entity with different biological behaviour and different treatment modalities.</P>

<P>
<B>Trials Selection</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers (AG, DHS) independently screened titles and abstracts of identified studies from the above sources for the eligibility criteria stated previously. If this could not be done satisfactorily from the title and abstract, a full text version was obtained for assessment. Studies that seemed to meet the inclusion criteria by this screening were assessed for eligibility with a designed form.</P>
<P>This eligibility form contained the following questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is the study described as randomised?</LI>
<LI>Did the participants in the study have aggressive lymphoma?</LI>
<LI>Was the investigated therapy the first therapy the participants received?</LI>
<LI>Were the participants in the experimental arm treated by a high-dose protocol with autologous stem cell support?</LI>
<LI>Were the participants in the control group treated by a polychemotherapy comparable to the standard CHOP protocol or one of the second- and third generation protocols?</LI>
</OL>
<P>After the completion of the protocol in 2002 we modified our eligibility criteria concerning the last aspect, as we also included trials that applied an intensified chemotherapy without stem cell support for the control group.<BR/>To be eligible, studies had to meet all of the criteria stated above. If there was insufficient information to judge eligibility, the first author of the report was contacted both by e-mail and by letter for clarification. Any disagreements between the reviewers were solved by discussion. Any duplicate reports were identified. Full text versions of all eligible studies were obtained for quality assessment and data collection.</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Types of participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>To be included trials had to fulfil all criteria described above. The term "aggressive lymphoma" relates to histological entities that are termed high-grade NHL in the Kiel classification and "high-grade" or "intermediate grade" in the Working Formulation. Trials that include Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma patients were not excluded. As mentioned above this decision came up after the first review of included studies. If very aggressive NHL were the major subject of a study e.g. the trial by Sweetenham et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Sweetenham" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetenham</LINK>) we excluded this due to different biological behaviour and treatment strategies. Also excluded were trials investigating plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma as this is a separate entity with different biological behaviour and different treatment modalities. Additionally, age below 16 years was a predefined exclusion criterion, because of different therapy and disease related characteristics in children.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Types of studies</I>
</B>
<BR/>We only considered randomised controlled trials. Quasi-randomised trials were not included. Abstracts and unpublished data were included if sufficient information on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes was available. Small studies with less than 20 patients per study arm were also excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Types of intervention</I>
</B>
<BR/>With respect to the control arm we extended our pre-defined criteria for conventional chemotherapy as not all included trials either applied CHOP or a second or third generation regimen. The reason was the frequent use of further regimens such as the so called "intensified conventional chemotherapy". The comparability to CHOP could not be clearly evaluated from the literature. We decided to include these trials in order to include more studies and patients. With respect to the experimental treatment arm, trials had to apply any high-dose protocol such as BEAM or BEAC, which requires stem cell support. There was no restriction for the use of either peripheral or bone marrow harvested stem cells.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Assessment</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers (DHS, AG) independently judged the quality of the eligible studies by using the full text article. Any disagreements were discussed with the rest of the review authors until consensus was obtained or authors were contacted to clarify. Quality was assessed using an assessment form designed for the topic of this review (sources used: <LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; Jüni 2001; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>). The following criteria were considered:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Was the method of randomisation satisfactory?</LI>
<LI>Was the treatment allocation concealed?</LI>
<LI>Were numbers and reasons of withdrawals, dropouts and losses to follow-up in each group stated?</LI>
<LI>Were analyses based on the intention-to-treat principle?</LI>
</OL>
<P>In cases we could not answer the mentioned questions from the full text article the authors were contacted to clarify. We explored the influence of individual quality criteria in sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Collection</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers (DHS, AG) independently collected data concerning details of study population, interventions and outcomes by using a standardised data extraction form. This form included at least the following items:</P>
<UL>
<LI>General information: title, authors, source, contact address, country, language and year of publication, duplicate publications, sponsoring and setting of trial</LI>
<LI>Trial characteristics including design, randomisation and concealment of allocation ·Interventions: intervention with dose and timing, co-medications with dose, route and timing, duration of aplasia</LI>
<LI>Patients: sampling, exclusion criteria, sample size, baseline characteristics, similarity of groups at baseline, diagnostic criteria, drop-outs</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: overall survival, event-free survival, complete response rate, disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, progression-free survival, toxicities (treatment-related mortality, infection rate, myelosuppression), survival after relapse, quality of life, time to induction therapy</LI>
</UL>
<P>The outcome "survival after relapse" was not pre-defined in our protocol.</P>
<P>We contacted the first authors of the included trials and asked for additional data such as trial characteristics e.g. methodological issues and further outcome measures if not adequately published. We further asked for individual patient data according to overall survival, event-free survival and for the outcome of the mentioned subgroups of poor prognosis patients according to the IPI score, if hazard ratios could not be obtained from the publication. Disagreements arising at any stage were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Analyses</B>
<BR/>For statistical analysis we used the Cochrane statistical package MetaView 4.1; the STATA software package was used for additional analyses, which could not be done with MetaView. Both fixed and random effects models were calculated in all meta-analyses. The fixed effect model was given more weight in the analysis; the random effects model was calculated to test the robustness of the results. To estimate treatment effects on time to event data such as OS and EFS, Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. If individual patient data (IPD) were not available, data were extracted from published results, e.g. survival curves, using methods described by Parmar et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). For binary data, the relative risk with corresponding 95% confidence intervals was determined. The Mantel-Haenszel Method was used for pooling. Potential causes of heterogeneity were explored with sensitivity analyses. For each endpoint including more than four trials a funnel plot was generated and a linear regression test was performed to test for potential bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The correlation between time to induction therapy and OS, EFS and CR was calculated using linear meta-regression analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity Analyses and Subgroup Analyses</B>
<BR/>According to both subgroup and sensitivity analyses tests for interaction have been performed. If no significant difference was present, the result is not shown.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses:</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Prognosis of patients:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Only the age-adjusted IPI score which classifies patients below age 60, was applied to describe the prognosis of patients. In contrast to the IPI the items age as well as extranodal site are not considered. This age-adjusted score separates four different groups according to the number of existing adverse prognostic factors: stage III or IV, LDH above normal value, and performance status. For all subgroup analyses we divided the four possible groups into two: a low risk group with IPI scores of 0 to 1 and a high risk group with IPI scores of 2 to 3. This was done in order to increase the power of the analyses by increasing the number studies in each group. These analyses were done for the outcomes OS, EFS, and complete response rate.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Type of HDT: </I>
</B>
<BR/>Some trials applied a sequential high-dose chemotherapy (HDS); other trials applied HDT after an abbreviated or after a full induction conventional chemotherapy. HDS is a distinctive approach that was defined as employing a sequence of two or three single drugs in a high but non-myeloablative dose, followed by myeloablative polychemotherapy consisting of a different set of drugs.<BR/>In some trials the HDT group received a reduced number of induction courses before receiving HDT, as compared to the conventional chemotherapy group. We coined this principle "abbreviated standard treatment" and were initially planning to define this by comparison with six courses of CHOP. However, the induction (conventional) courses differed widely between respective trials and there was not enough published evidence available that allowed us to perform such a comparison for each trial. Thus, we defined "abbreviated" only by comparing the number of induction courses in the HDT and in the control arm, the latter serving as the "standard". The separation of different types of HDT has been similarly described previously (<LINK REF="REF-Shipp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipp 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Patients' status of disease</I>: </B>
<BR/>We created different subgroups according to the response status of patients randomised within the included trials. Some trials randomised patients before the onset of treatment, we called this "irrespectively of their disease status". Others randomised patients after a certain amount of chemotherapy independently of the response to the chemotherapy. These trials were also grouped under "irrespectively of their disease status". Again others applied some amount of chemotherapy and randomised only subgroups of patients such as the group of patients who achieved a partial remission or a patients that achieved a complete remission. Corresponding groups for patients in PR and CR were performed (named "patients in PR" and "CR" respectively). This subgroup analysis was not pre-defined, but a consequence of the observed responses to chemotherapy of different lymphomas and patients. This response can be expected to be of high relevance for the effectiveness of HDT.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Timing of HDT</I>: </B>
<BR/>In a linear meta-regression analysis we estimated the association between the time point of the application of HDT and OS, EFS as well as CR rate. The time was either the real time extracted from the publication or provided by the investigators, or the allowed time according to the protocol for the respective treatment before HDT.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Age groups: </I>
</B>
<BR/>The previously described analysis of different age groups could not be performed due to the fact that all trials included only patients less than 65 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses:</B>
<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were considered for the following outcome criteria: </P>
<UL>
<LI>overall survival (OS), </LI>
<LI>event-free survival (EFS), </LI>
<LI>complete response rate (CR), </LI>
<LI>and treatment-related mortality (TRM).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sensitivity analyses included study quality (sufficient versus insufficient/unknown method), study size (threshold 100 patients), proportion of patients with bone marrow involvement (threshold 20%), different HDT regimens (BEAM, BEAC, TBI containing regimens, and others), proportion of patients who actually received HDT (threshold 70%), and source of data (published vs. IPD). Concerning the proportion of patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) two different comparisons were addressed by using a closer and a wider definition (thresholds 70% and 80% of included patients per trial). For the closer definition only group G of the Working Formulation (WF) was counted as diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), whereas groups F, G, and H were defined as DLCL for the wider definition.<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were only performed if sufficient number of trial results (N = 4) could be included.</P>

<P>Through electronic literature searches and hand searches we retrieved 5,227 potentially relevant articles and 117 abstracts. This first search, which was done in August and September 2002, was repeated in November 2006. The second search identified one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and some updated publications of already included trials. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK> and Martelli (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>) previously published as abstract could be retrieved as paper publication by this search. <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> provides information about the route of identification and integration of the included studies according to the QUORUM statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>After a first screening by DHS and AG 75 publications (papers as well as abstracts) remained. Full texts of paper articles had been obtained for further assessment, because we were not able to assess eligibility from the title and abstract. Out of the 75 publications 56 studies were excluded. Out of these the study by Sweetenham et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Sweetenham" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetenham</LINK>) included only patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. This study was excluded as only patients with very fast growing NHL were randomised. The biological behaviour as well as the treatment of this histological entity is different from aggressive NHL.</P>
<P>In total 20 randomised controlled trials which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified. The ECOG-2493 trial was excluded, because this trial was closed prematurely for poor accrual after enrolment of 14 patients. Results have never been published and no data were available. Furthermore, this trial randomised fewer patients than required for inclusion.</P>
<P>We found additionally 1,280 publications in the update search in June 2010, but no none of the publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>Four trials were ongoing at the time of this analysis, of which one (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>) could be included in the analysis. One study with 457 patients was excluded for this analysis as the data reported in the abstract did not permit a detailed evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Linch" TYPE="STUDY">Linch</LINK>).

All these data were checked thoroughly to ensure both the accuracy of the statistical analysis and the quality of the trials. Any ambiguities between the published an unpublished data were resolved by discussions with the trial investigators or statisticians. Meta-analyses of survival data were done using both data from published reports and from individual patient data received by the authors. These analyses were compared as a quality control measure.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK> and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>) compared MACOP-B (12 weeks) with inductive high-dose sequential chemotherapy (HDS) comprising four sequential phases and a fifth phase of myeloablative treatment. Patients without significant response (defined as less than 80% tumour volume reduction) after four phases received MACOP-B as salvage treatment. Patients in the control arm received HDS in case of inadequate response after 12 weeks MACOP-B, thus receiving the same therapy as the study group as salvage treatment. As the trial setting was before 1993 no restriction according to IPI was made but patients with bone marrow involvement were not randomised. The published results are based on data of 98 out of 101 randomised patients.<BR/>The LNH93-3 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>) performed a randomised comparison of conventional chemotherapy using the ACVBP regimen for four cycles followed by a non-myeloablative consolidation (outpatient setting) compared with an intensified induction therapy consisting of one cycle CEOP and two cycles ECVBP followed by high-dose therapy (BEAM) and ASCT. Eligible patients had to present at least two negative prognostic factors according to the age-adjusted IPI. The published results are based on 370 out of 397 randomised patients. 27 patients were excluded from the analysis due to ineligibility. For our IPD analyses, data of all 370 randomised patients were included.<BR/>The LNH87-2 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>) randomised patients who achieved a complete remission after induction therapy using ACVB or NCVB (ACVB versus NCVB as an independent first randomisation) either to a sequential consolidation therapy according to the LNH84 protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 1989</LINK>) or to an intensive consolidation with high-dose methotrexate followed by the CBV regimen and ASCT. Of 916 eligible patients registered onto the study 614 achieved a complete remission and 541 (reasons for exclusion: medical condition, refusal, protocol violation) were randomised and included in our analyses. As patients were recruited before the generation of the IPI score, the inclusion criteria did not specify the IPI score. However, patients had to present with at least one adverse factor (PS &gt; 1, or extranodal disease &gt; 1 lymph node regions, or tumour burden &gt;/= 10 cm, or bone marrow or CNS (central nervous system) involvement, or histological subtype of Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma).<BR/>Following the establishment of the IPI score the investigators retrospectively performed a subgroup analysis of 236 patients classified as high-intermediate or high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK> (subgroup). The results concerning these patients could be included in our analysis, whereas the results of low and low-intermediate IPI risk patients were not available (neither published nor provided) and were therefore not included in our IPI subgroup analyses.<BR/>A Thailand group (<LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>) randomised patients after three cycles of CHOP irrespectively of their treatment response to either five further cycles CHOP or to four cycles of ESHAP followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell support. Only patients with high-intermediate or high risk IPI were included. A total of 48 patients were randomised and included in our analyses.<BR/>The German High-Grade NHL Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>) conducted a trial comparing five cycles of CHOEP with three cycles of CHOEP followed by high-dose therapy (BEAM) and ASCT. Patients were randomised before the first cycle of CHOEP. Only patients with LDH serum level above normal value were included. 312 of 331 randomised patients were included in the final results. 19 patients were excluded due to violation of entry criteria.<BR/>Within the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 20901 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>) patients were treated with three cycles of CHVmP/BV and restaged thereafter. Those patients achieving at least a partial response without bone marrow involvement were randomly assigned to five further cycles of CHVmP/BV or to three further cycles CHVmP/BV followed by high-dose therapy (BEAC) and ASCT. There was no restriction for inclusion of patients according to the IPI. In total this trial randomised and analysed 194 patients. This trial was closed before the planned 200 randomisedN = patients were recruited due to interim results.<BR/>Martelli and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>) randomised 49 patients who achieved a partial response after induction treatment consisting either of eight cycles MACOP-B or of four cycles F-MACHOP (MACOP-B versus F-MACHOP as an independent first randomisation). The control group received an early intensification therapy with the "non-cross resistant" regimen DHAP (6 cycles) and the experimental group was treated with high-dose therapy (BEAC) followed by ASCT. As the trial setting was before 1993 no restriction according to IPI was made. All patients were in included in the final publication and in our analyses.<BR/>An Italian study group (<LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>) recently completed a trial comparing MACOP-B (12 weeks) alone with MACOP-B (eight weeks) followed by high-dose therapy (BEAC) and ASCT for poor risk patients (age-adjusted IPI 2 or 3 risk factors). Patients were randomised before the first cycle of MACOP-B. 150 patients were randomised and analysed. All were included in our analyses.<BR/>The GOELAMS (<LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) conducted a RCT comparing eight cycles of CHOP with a high-dose setting consisting of two courses of CEEP, which is an intensified conventional regimen, one course of high-dose Methotrexate plus Cytarabine, and BEAM followed by ASCT. Only non-high risk patients according to the IPI score were included. 197 patients were randomised and analysed. All were included in our analyses?.<BR/>Rodriguez and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>) performed a RCT comparing 9 cycles of an alternating regimen (ATT) with brief induction chemotherapy of two cycles followed by two cycles of an intensified dose chemotherapy and BEAM and ASCT. 116 patients were randomised and 108 of them analysed. A subgroup analysis according to different IPI groups was not reported so far.<BR/>In a RCT by the Italian NHL Cooperative Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>) 124 patients were randomly assigned before treatment to receive either VACOP-B (12 weeks) or the same regimen followed by high-dose therapy (BEAM) and ASCT. Patients in the experimental arm proceeded to HDT and ASCT after VACOP-B independently of their disease status. In the control arm patients without complete response received DHAP as salvage therapy. There was no restriction for inclusion of patients made according to the IPI. All patients were included in the publication and our analyses.<BR/>Another RCT conducted by the same group (<LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>) compared patients receiving VACOP-B (12 weeks) alone with patients receiving abbreviated induction therapy with eight weeks of VACOP-B followed by high-dose sequential therapy (Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, BEAM) and ASCT. Patients in the control arm underwent HDS and ASCT as salvage therapy in case of persistent disease. There was no restriction for inclusion of patients made according to the IPI. This trial was not included in our analysis for time to event data, because we could not calculate HRs. In total, 223 patients were randomised.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK> and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>) randomised patients who achieved a partial response and did not have bone marrow involvement after three cycles of CHOP. The control group received five additional courses of CHOP whereas patients assigned to the experimental group moved on to one further cycle of CHOP and high-dose therapy (Cyclophosphamide and TBI) followed by ASCT. Out of 286 eligible patients receiving three cycles of CHOP 133 achieved a partial response and 106 of them had no bone marrow involvement. Finally 73 of these 106 patients were randomised. There was no restriction for inclusion of patients made according to the IPI.<BR/>The Italian Lymphoma Intergroup (<LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>) performed a RCT comparing patients receiving six to eight courses MegaCHOEP with patients receiving one or two courses APO and high-dose sequential therapy followed by autologous stem cell support. As eligibility criterion patients had to present with at least two risk factors according to the age-adjusted IPI. In total, 126 of 130 randomised patients were analysed.</P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of Participants </B>
<BR/>Overall 15 trials with a total of 3,079 randomised patients (range within the trials: 48 to 541) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Five trials included less than 100 patients, five of the trials randomised between 200 and 457 patients.<BR/>The median age ranged from 27 to 48 years in 12 trials of the 15 included trials. For three trials the median or mean age of randomised patients was not available but the inclusion criterion age was between 15 and 59 years and therefore comparable to the other trials. In nine of the 12 trials the median age was between 40 and 48 years (<LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). The patients in the study by Martelli had the lowest median age with 27 and 29 years (<LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>) in the respective arms; patients randomised in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK> had a median age of 34 and 35 years (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>) in the respective arms, and in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK> 37.5 years (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>).<BR/>Due to the substantive changes of the classification of lymphomas over the last three decades the included trials used different classifications both for eligibility of patients and for description of results. In summary the Working Formulation (WF) was used in eight trials, the Kiel classification in two trials, the REAL classification in two trials, the WHO classification in one trial, and three trials did not report which classification was used (one trial applied two classifications). The comparability of the different classifications is limited. Therefore the interpretation and comparison of patient's histological lymphoma subtypes is difficult.<BR/>Central pathological review to confirm diagnosis was performed in 10 trials. For two trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>) this was not done. For two trials there was no information available (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>).<BR/>Regardless of the different classifications, diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) was the most frequent entity. Detailed information on the histological distribution was available for 13 trials. Using a narrow definition the percentage of patients ranged from 34% (<LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>) to 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, both used the WF, which may overestimate number of DLCL). When using a wide definition 71% to 100% of the patients had DLCL. Of 13 trials the range of percentage of very fast growing lymphoma, including Burkitt and lymphoblastic lymphoma, was 0% to 8% (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>). Eight trials did not have any patients of this histology. Further common entities were anaplastic large cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and diffuse mixed cell lymphoma.<BR/>For fourteen trials we had information on the IPI score. The distribution within each trial is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Five trials randomised high-intermediate or high risk age-adjusted IPI only (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) randomised only patients with high-intermediate, low-intermediate or low risk age-adjusted IPI. Patients were retrospectively classified according to the IPI within seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>).<BR/>The proportion of patients who actually received HDT within the HDT arms differed widely between the trials and is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> (range: 60% to 100%).</P>

<P>The UK Lymphoma Group initiated the LY02 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Linch" TYPE="STUDY">Linch</LINK>) in which patients were randomised to six to eight cycles of CHOP or three cycles of CHOP followed by high-dose therapy (BEAM) and ASCT. Only patients with an objective response without progression and bone marrow involvement after three cycles of CHOP proceeded to HDT and ASCT. Patients had to have high-intermediate or high risk IPI. 457 patients have been randomised. So far, this study is only published as abstract and no data were available from the authors. Due to missing information to calculate HRs this trial was not included in our results.<BR/>As mentioned before the study by Sweetenham et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Sweetenham" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetenham</LINK>) included only patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. This study was excluded as only patients with very fast growing NHL were randomised.

<B>
<I>Randomisation</I>
</B>
<BR/>All included studies were described as randomised controlled trials. Ten trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>) used random number tables for randomisation. In two trials randomisation was assumed to be adequate as it took place centrally (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>). In three trials the method of randomisation was not adequately stated (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>) and not available from the study authors.<BR/>Stratification was performed in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). Minimisation technique was used in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>). (Minimisation is designed to reduce any difference in the distribution of known or suspected determinants of outcome. During the randomisation process, patients are assigned using a randomisation weighted towards the group to which assignment minimise the imbalance. After each patient is entered the relevant totals for each determinant are updated. The next patient is subsequently more likely allocated to the treatment group in which his inclusion would improve the balance of the determinants between treatment groups).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</B>
<BR/>Concealment of allocation was considered adequate in 12 trials. Of these ten trials deployed an institution separated from the recruitment centres (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). The assignment in two trials was kept in sealed envelopes in the centre where patients were seen (<LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>). The concealment of allocation could not be clarified in three trials, as this information was neither stated in the publication nor provided by the study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Drop-outs and withdrawals</I>
</B>
<BR/>As the number of drop-outs and withdrawals is essential for the calculation of HRs in the main analyses, we included only trials that dealt adequately with drop-outs and withdrawals.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding</I>
</B>
<BR/>None of the trials mentioned blinding, as it appears impossible to apply high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation in a blinded fashion.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Intention to treat analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> outlines the use of the intention to treat principle in each particular trial. In total, for ten trials data according to this principle could be pooled for our analyses. Data of four trials that did not follow this principle were included. The investigators stated reasons for the exclusion, which can be obtained from <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> and reasons were judged adequate by us. In summary, for the present meta-analyses outcomes were in fact recorded for all but 65 patients.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Impact on analyses</I>
</B>
<BR/>In conclusion, 12 of 15 included studies in this review were considered to be of adequate methodological quality, i.e. fulfilling all quality criteria (internal validity). One trial was only considered for the pooled analyses of CR and TRM (<LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>). This trial was not included in our analysis for time to event data, because we could not calculate HRs due to missing data.</P>

<B>Overall survival (OS)</B>
<BR/>Fourteen studies including 2,444 patients were analysed (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). Ten investigators provided us with IPD information according to age-adjusted IPI (aaIPI) and overall survival. For four trials we extracted data from survival curves, because IPD data were not provided through the responsible authors.<B> </B>The pooled hazard ratio (HR) was 1.05 ([95% CI 0.92 to 1.19], P = 0.50). There was no statistical heterogeneity among the trials (P = 0.14). According to the intention-to-treat principle the analysis included all but 61/2,505 (2.5%) patients, who were initially randomised. There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.033) between studies reporting results by intention-to-treat analysis (HR 0.92; 0.77 to 1.09) compared to no ITT (HR 1.22; 1.00 to 1.49). Excluding those studies where individual patient data were not available the HR as an IPD analysis for overall survival increases (HR 1.14; CI 0.98 to 1.34).<BR/>Meta-regression analysis showed no association between the time of HDT application and overall survival (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).<BR/>The subgroup analysis of prognostic patient groups according to the aaIPI score was based on 12 trials including 2,235 patients. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>) had to be excluded from this analysis as aaIPI data were not available. The subgroup of patients with good risk aaIPI showed some evidence for impaired OS with HDT (HR 1.46; CI 1.02 to 2.09). For poor risk patients, there was no difference between the treatment groups (HR 0.95; CI 0.81 to 1.11). The difference between good and poor risk patients was statistically significant (P = 0.032). Within the poor risk group, three studies showed significant effect estimates either favouring HDT (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) or in contrast a disadvantage for HDT (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>) and contributed substantially to the heterogeneity observed (P = 0.004). Excluding the detrimental study (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>) heterogeneity was reduced (P = 0.10) and the significant difference between the good and poor risk patients became more apparent (poor risk group HR 0.80; CI 0.67 to 0.96; P-value for difference between groups: 0.004). Excluding the positive studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) while including the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> heterogeneity was also reduced (P = 0.25) and no evidence for an effect of HDT on survival was seen (poor risk: HR 1.10; CI 0.92 to 1.31).<BR/>The allocation of trials according to different high-dose protocols can be obtained from <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>) with high-dose sequential chemotherapy were analysed. The pooled HR was 1.01 [95% CI 0.65 to 1.56]. However, there was significant statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.04). Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>), which applied abbreviated standard induction therapy before HDT, did not show a significant effect but a trend towards better overall survival within the control group (HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.97 to 1.35]). There was no statistical heterogeneity present.<BR/>Four trials that applied HDT after full standard induction (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>) showed also no difference (HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.69 to 1.10]).<BR/>With respect to the different high-dose concepts there were no evidence for statistical heterogeneity or differences between groups.<BR/>A subgroup analysis of 11 trials that randomised patients irrespectively of their disease status (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>) did not show a significant difference (HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.92 to 1.23], test for heterogeneity 0.09). The exclusion of the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>), which randomised patients in PR and CR, did not change the result (data not shown). Subgroup analysis of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>) that randomised patients with partial response did not reveal a significant difference (HR 1.09 [95% CI 0.65 to 1.83], P = 0.75). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>) that randomised only patients in CR after full standard induction therapy showed no statistical difference between treatment arms (HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.30]).<BR/>There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.033) between studies reporting results by intention-to-treat analysis (HR 0.92; 0.77 to 1.09) compared to no ITT (HR 1.22; 1.00 to 1.49).

IPD were available from nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>); for three additional trial HRs were calculated from the published (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) or unpublished study data (<LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). Thus, twelve trials with 1,795 patients were included. As shown in MetaView, there was no evidence for improved EFS in patients receiving HDT when compared to conventional chemotherapy (HR 0.92; CI 0.80 to 1.05). Strong evidence for statistical heterogeneity among the trials was present (P = 0.002). We observed a significant difference (P = 0.004) between trials including more or less than 70% of patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma favouring studies with higher percentage of patients with DCLC. None of the other subgroups tested demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the subgroups compared. In both good and poor risk patients there was no evidence for an effect of HDT on EFS (good risk: HR 1.02; CI 0.75 to 1.37, poor risk: HR 0.95; CI 0.81 to 1.11). Strong evidence for heterogeneity was present in the poor risk patients group (P = 0.007). After excluding the study published by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>) the heterogeneity observed was reduced (P = 0.10) and a survival benefit became apparent in the poor risk group (HR 0.78, CI 0.65 to 0.94). However, even after excluding <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al. the difference between good and poor risk patients was not statistically significant (P = 0.145). Excluding the positive studies (<LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) heterogeneity was reduced (P = 0.18) and no evidence for an effect of HDT on survival was seen (poor risk: HR 1.07; CI 0.90 to 1.26).<BR/>Regarding the subgroup of studies with high-dose sequential therapy, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK> et al. demonstrated a significant improvement (76% [CI 60 to 89%] for the patients receiving HDT and 49% [CI 32 to 65%] for the control group, log-rank test: P = 0.004); however, the pooled HR was 0.75 ([95% CI 0.51 to 1.12], P = 0.16). There was significant heterogeneity among these trials (P = 0.01). The pooled HR for seven trials that applied HDT after abbreviated induction therapy was 0.97 ([95% CI 0.84 to 1.13], P = 0.7). These subgroup analyses for EFS revealed significant statistical heterogeneity, which was not apparent when excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> trial. There was no significant effect pooling data of trials applying HDT after full standard induction (HR 0.74; CI 0.50 to 1.10).<BR/>According to the overall analysis for EFS the performed sensivity analyses revealed further heterogeneity.<BR/>Based on the data available, there is no evidence that HDT improves EFS in the first-line treatment of good and poor risk patients with aggressive NHL. The heterogeneity observed was mainly caused by the study published by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al. Exclusion of this study eliminates the heterogeneity and results in a significant improvement regarding EFS for patients with poor prognosis according to the IPI score and for patients who received abbreviated standard induction before HDT.</P>
<P>
<B>Complete response rate (CR)</B>
<BR/>Fourteen studies including 2,126 patients were analysed (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). The relative risk to achieve CR was 1.11 favouring patients treated with HDT (RR 1.11; CI 1.04-1.18). There was no statistical heterogeneity among the trials (P = 0.09).<BR/>Subgroup analysis did not reveal significant differences:<BR/>The relative risk for patients with low and low-intermediate IPI was RR 0.98 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.21] and for patients with high-intermediate and high risk IPI RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.13] (see MetaView 03-02) with no significant difference between groups. This analysis was based on eight trials and 1,182 patients.<BR/>Subgroups analysis according to different high-dose protocols did also not show significant differences between the groups.<BR/>Based on the available data there was a significant effect for HDT to improve CR rate in the total study sample size.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Meta-regression analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>Linear meta-regression analysis of the time when HDT was applied after induction therapy within the trials was performed. The intervals used can be obtained from <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. With regard to OS, EFS, and CR rates 12, 9, and 11 trials were included respectively. The results did not show any association between the time of HDT application to these endpoints (see figures: <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).<BR/>Based on this analysis, there was no indication that the time point of HDT application influenced the outcome. However, this estimate is based on indirect comparisons only.</P>
<P>
<B>Disease-free survival (DFS)/Relapse-free survival (RFS)</B>
<BR/>DFS was applied only to patients who obtained a CR after induction therapy. The duration was measured from date of achieving CR to the date of relapse, death or last follow-up. RFS was also applied to patients who reached a CR only, and measured to the date of relapse or last follow-up. In contrast to the definition for DFS, patients who died were calculated as censored instead of event.<BR/>Five trials with 350 patients were pooled in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>). The pooled HR was 0.63 in favour of patients receiving HDT using the fixed effect model (HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.96], P = 0.03) (see Meta-View 04). There was no significant heterogeneity among trials (P = 0.10) but the sensitivity analysis addressing the respective end-point used, i.e. DFS or RFS, respectively, revealed a significant between group heterogeneity (P = 0.031). A stronger treatment effect could be seen in three trials in which RFS was assessed (HR 0.37 [95% CI 0.19 to 0.70]) as compared to assessment of DFS in two trials (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.54 to 1.59]). Therefore, pooling of DFS and RFS was not appropriate.<BR/>Based on the available data, there was significantly improved RFS for patients who received a HDT as compared to patients who received conventional chemotherapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Survival after relapse</B>
<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>) including 118 patients who relapsed were analysed. The pooled HR was 2.05 [95% CI 1.32 to 3.17] and the test of significance was P = 0.0014, favouring patients who received conventional chemotherapy (see MetaView 05). This effect was similar using both the fixed and the random effects model. There was no statistical heterogeneity between the trials (P = 0.55).<BR/>Based on the available data, survival was statistically significantly worse for patients who relapsed after HDT as part of first-line therapy compared to patients who relapse after conventional chemotherapy. No effect was seen for DFS.</P>
<P>
<B>Progression-free survival</B>
<BR/>PFS was reported in four trials. Results could not be pooled, as HR was only estimable in one trial. Reported results are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment related mortality (TRM) - Mortality during treatment (MDT)</B>
<BR/>Thirteen trials including 2,361 patients were analysed (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). Higher mortality was seen in patients treated with HDT, but the effect was not statistically significant (OR 1.33 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.93], P = 0.14) (see MetaView 06-01). There was no statistical heterogeneity among the trials (P = 0.59). As definitions for treatment related deaths could not be clarified definitely, a subgroup analysis of "treatment related mortality", "mortality during treatment" and "other similar terms" as defined in the original publications was performed. In none of these subgroups significant results became apparent and no significant between-groups differences were measured. Sensitivity analyses for quality and size of study, proportion of DLCL, HDT protocol adherence, bone marrow involvement, preparative regimen, type of high-dose protocol did not show significant differences.<BR/>The proportion of patients with treatment related deaths ranged widely from 0% to 32%. However, except in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK> et al., none found significant more treatment related deaths in patients treated with HDT. Based on the available data, there was a non-significantly higher risk of treatment related deaths in the HDT group.</P>
<P>
<B>Toxicities</B>
<BR/>Analyses according to the number of patients who had leuko- or neutropenia (four trials with 597 patients) as well as thrombocytopenia (five trials with 967 patients) greater than grade two as defined by the WHO classification did show significantly stronger myelosuppression in the HDT group (RR: 1.59 [1.46; 1.72] and 6.08 [4.74; 7.81]; both analyses P&lt;0.00001) (see MetaView 07). There was significant statistical heterogeneity among trials but all trials demonstrated the same trend.<BR/>Six trials were analysed for infection greater than grade two as defined by the WHO classification. The infection rate was significantly higher for patients treated with HDT (RR 4.42 [95% CI 2.75 to 7.08], P&lt;0.00001, test for heterogeneity: P = 0.008) (see MetaView 07).<BR/>To assess the incidence of secondary neoplasm six trials including 757 patients could be aggregated. This analysis showed no significant difference between treatment groups (RR 0.94 [95% CI 0.39 to 2.25], P = 0.88, test for heterogeneity: P = 0.48) (see MetaView 07). The median follow-up time was short (range: 39 to 55 months).<BR/>Based on the available data, there was clear evidence for higher rates of adverse events in the HDT arm. But the median follow-up was too short to draw an accurate conclusion concerning the development of secondary neoplasm. Reported results are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life (QoL)</B>
<BR/>Two of the included trials assessed QoL. Results could not be pooled as different methods of assessment were applied.<BR/>A quality of life-adjusted time without symptom and toxicity (Q-TWIST) method was applied to patients included in the LNH-87 trial (<LINK REF="REF-Mounier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mounier 2000</LINK>). This method compares treatments by defining relevant clinical health states and estimating their respective durations without patients self assessment by questionnaires. There was a non-significant trend towards increased median time of Q-TWiST for patients treated with HDT (by analysing areas under the curve). Furthermore, a significant quality-adjusted survival gain in high risk patients treated with HDT was found. In the HOVON study (<LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>) QoL and cost-utility analyses were done for 51 patients of the 73 randomised. Concerning QoL within the first two years post treatment, complaints and symptoms were more often/severe in the HDT arm than in the CHOP arm. Considering life long consequences in terms of quality-adjusted life years, HDT patients experienced 0.14 life years and 0.22 quality-adjusted life years less than the patients in the CHOP arm (<LINK REF="REF-Uyl_x002d_de-Groot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uyl-de Groot 1995</LINK>).<BR/>The results of these two investigations were contradictory when compared and no definitive conclusion can be drawn.</P>
<P>
<B>Results of Methodological Assessment<I>
<BR/>Selection bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>As described above, in all but two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>) the concealment of allocation and method of randomisation was rated as adequate. For the study published by <LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK> et al. no information was available. However, inclusion or exclusion of these studies did not change the result for overall survival.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Performance bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>Performance bias can not be excluded since blinding with placebo was not possible for the transplantation procedure used in the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Attrition bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>Nine trials included for the primary outcome measure followed the intention to treat principle, i.e. including all randomised patients in the final analysis (<LINK REF="STD-De-Souza" TYPE="STUDY">De Souza</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Intragumtornchai" TYPE="STUDY">Intragumtornchai</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kluin_x002d_Nelemans" TYPE="STUDY">Kluin-Nelemans</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martelli 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Santini" TYPE="STUDY">Santini</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>,). The remaining trials excluded some randomised patients in the final analysis who violated inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vitolo" TYPE="STUDY">Vitolo</LINK>). For the publication of the HOVON trial (<LINK REF="STD-Verdonck" TYPE="STUDY">Verdonck</LINK>) four ineligible patients had been excluded from their analysis. However, due to the availability of IPD, the results of the HOVON trial could be integrated based on the intention-to treat principle. In total, data of 97% randomised patients were evaluable for this analysis. Due to this high number and the fact that adequate reasons for exclusion were given, we assumed the absence of attrition bias.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Publication bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>A funnel plot analysis was performed to investigate for publication bias or other biases. Although graphical asymmetry could be observed for OS and EFS indicating that studies with negative findings might be underrepresented, related linear regression tests did not show significance (data not shown). Consequently there is no evidence for publication bias.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Reporting bias</I>
</B>
<BR/>All included studies have been published. Some data and trial characteristics included in our review were provided and cannot be found in the published reports.<BR/>For those trials we were provided with IPD by the investigators we also extracted the results reported in the corresponding articles. This was done as a further component to test the robustness of our results. To achieve this, we compared the results of published data to the results obtained from IPD of the same trials according to OS.<BR/>It is mentionable that for the analyses of endpoints such as DFS, RFS and survival after relapse in particular, we had to deal with selectiveness, as not all these endpoints were reported for all trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses</B>
<BR/>To incorporate the influence of clinical diversity of the included trials to some extent, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses, which are mentioned separately for each outcome measured. In general, we found some imbalance that was related to the largest trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-25 14:51:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the influence of high dose chemotherapy (HDT) in the first-line treatment of patients with aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). It is based on 15 prospectively randomised trials including a total of 2,728 patients. The following findings emerge from this analysis: (i) In general, there was no evidence that HDT improves overall survival (OS) (HR 1.05; CI 0.92-1.19) or event free survival (EFS) (HR 0.92; CI 0.80-1.05). (ii) In patients with good risk aaIPI there was some evidence for worse OS (HR 1.46; CI 1.02-2.09) when treated with HDT. (iii) In contrast, there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence that poor risk patients may benefit from HDT. After excluding a clinically unfavourable study (26), the HR was 0.80 for OS (CI 0.67-0.96) and 0.78 for EFS (CI 0.65-0.94).<BR/>The fate of patients with aggressive NHL remains unsatisfactory, particularly for those with intermediate and poor risk according to the international prognostic index (<LINK REF="REF-Project-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Project 1993</LINK>). In an attempt to improve the prognosis, several clinical trials examined HDT followed by autologous stem cell support. Although retrospective analyses had suggested that HDT might be superior to conventional chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nademanee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nademanee 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fanin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanin 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cortelazzo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortelazzo 1999</LINK>), the findings of prospectively randomised clinical trials gave conflicting results.<BR/>Pooled analyses of the data from published trials may shed some light on the impact of HDT in this setting. Two prior meta-analyses, however, failed to provide definite answers (<LINK REF="REF-Simnett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simnett 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Strehl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strehl 2003</LINK>). This research evaluated a variety of different entities including both solid tumours and haematological malignancies or had fewer patients compared to the present analysis. Most importantly, both studies did not evaluate individual patient data. In contrast, the present systematic review and meta-analysis is primarily based on IPD data for the most important outcome measures OS and EFS. In fact, the odds ratios used in the previous analyses are based on cumulative death rates at one particular time point and are considered to increase the risk of biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Duchateau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duchateau 2001</LINK>).<BR/>Strengths of the present meta-analysis:<BR/>The internal validity of 12 out of 15 trials covering more than 90% of included patients was given. Additionally, the performed sensitivity analysis addressing the influence of those two studies with uncertain validity did not indicate any influence. Funnel plot analyses did not show any evidence for publication bias. The presence of attrition bias was unlikely as data of 97% patients randomised were included. Possible bias due to the use of unpublished individual patient data and published data (<LINK REF="REF-Buyse-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buyse 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jeng-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeng 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1993</LINK>) was ruled out as a comparison of both data types did not show any differences.<BR/>By using only hazard ratios for the analysis of time-to-event data, the risk of bias by inaccurate statistical method such as using odds ratios, which base on particular time points only, could be minimised.<BR/>Additionally, we incorporated potential confounders such as the response status of patients before receiving HDT, the proportion of protocol adherence and the conditioning regimens used in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Our analysis suggests that none of these factors have an influence on the results reported here. Further confounders such as different standard chemotherapy could not be addressed on the basis of the data available and are being discussed here. Although CHOP is commonly seen as the gold standard treatment for aggressive lymphoma, there were only four trials which applied CHOP in the control group. Most of the other regimens were not compared in a randomised controlled trial or not compared at all. In addition some trials applied an intensified chemotherapy in the control arm (ACVB, CHOEP, MegaCEOP). With respect to different histologies, the patient characteristics varied considerably across the trials. As certain NHL entities might respond better or worse to HDT (Deconinck 2000, <LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Intragumtornchai-03" TYPE="REFERENCE">Intragumtornchai 03</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gisselbrecht-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gisselbrecht 1998</LINK>), it is conceivable that these variations might lead to a distortion of our pooled analyses.<BR/>With regard to histological classification, it was difficult to assess the proportion of diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) within the trials due to the different classifications used (WF, Kiel, REAL) and the limitations of transferability. However, the proportion of DLCL, which is the largest group of aggressive NHL, was analysed in a sensitivity analysis and thus the influence of this confounder was diminished. Other sub entities such as anaplastic, T-cell, and very fast growing NHL for which different outcome are described in the literature (Deconinck 2000, <LINK REF="REF-Intragumtornchai-03" TYPE="REFERENCE">Intragumtornchai 03</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gisselbrecht-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gisselbrecht 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sweetenham" TYPE="STUDY">Sweetenham</LINK>), could not be analysed separately. However, as these sub entities are relatively rare they are unlikely to have distorted the overall analyses.<BR/>Taking the results form all clinical studies analysed, there was no evidence for HDT to improve OS or EFS in this group of patients. However, there were some differences between risk groups stratified according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index. Good risk patients i.e. those with low or low-intermediate risk according to aaIPI showed some evidence for impaired OS with HDT. In contrast, there was no negative impact of HDT for OS in poor risk patients, i.e. those with high-intermediate and high aaIPI risk score. There was however significant heterogeneity between the trials analysed in the subset of poor risk patients. This heterogeneity can be attributed to three trials which showed either very good (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>) or very bad results (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>). Excluding the detrimental study published by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al resulted in reduction of heterogeneity in the OS and the EFS analysis and improved outcomes for poor risk patients. However, after exclusion of the positive studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>), the positive effects of HDT on OS and EFS in poor patients disappeared. These conflicting results can be accounted for, in part, by different inclusion criteria and chemotherapy regimens used in the trials. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK> et al used late consolidation in responders, and the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al used early intensification with short therapy.<BR/>Obviously, removing the <LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK> et al data on OS and EFS from this analysis poses questions as to the validity of this operation. This trial was stopped at the first interim analysis due to the poor results in the HDT arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>). Subsequently, the 5 year OS for patients receiving HDT and standard chemotherapy was 46 +/- 8% and 60 +/- 8%; EFS was 39 +/- 8% and 52 +/- 8% (<LINK REF="STD-Gisselbrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Gisselbrecht</LINK>). Even though the rationale of the abbreviated trial design was to introduce HDT early, the dose intensity in the HDT arm was lower in comparison to the conventional arm consisting of a dose-intensified CHOP variant (ACVBP). In the HDT arm, a new CHOP variant (CEOP) was introduced with doxorubicin replaced by the less effective epirubicin. On the other hand, this trial included a substantial number of very high-risk patients such as patients with T-cell lymphoma, bone marrow involvement, bulky disease and elevated LDH. It has been shown that poorly controlled aggressive NHL is associated with a high probability of contaminating malignant cells in the stem cell transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Jacquy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquy 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Two studies included in the present meta-analysis had given statistically significant better OS for poor risk patients when treated with HDT (<LINK REF="STD-Haioun" TYPE="STUDY">Haioun</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>). Interestingly, the LNH87-2 study was the only trial applying HDT for poor risk patients in CR after full standard conventional chemotherapy. The other study randomised 197 patients between standard CHOP and HDT consisting of two cycles of CEEP followed by methotrexate and ARA-C with BEAM (<LINK REF="STD-Milpied" TYPE="STUDY">Milpied</LINK>). In 105 patients with high-intermediate risk according to aaIPI, OS and EFS were 74% and 56% in the HDT arm and 44% and 28% in the CHOP arm, respectively (P = 0.001). Importantly, although induction treatment before HDT was shorter than in the conventional therapy arm, 86% of these patients achieved CR after two courses of CEEP compared to 84% of patients after four courses of CHOP. Thus, one important aspect in designing clinical trials for patients with poor risk aggressive NHL is the need to adequately control disease activity in these fast growing malignancies as much as possible before HDT is given.<BR/>A limitation of our study with regards to OS and EFS is that complete data sets were not available for all the studies included. The analysis was further hampered by the diversity of the various standard and high-dose chemotherapy protocols applied and the lack of standardized definitions for outcome parameters as already mentioned.<BR/>Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was not significantly higher with HDT compared to conventional chemotherapy. This finding indicates that the TRM is unlikely responsible for the lack of survival benefit observed in our pooled results. Additionally noteworthy, it was observed or assumed, respectively, that a significant number of patients in the control arm received HDT as second-line therapy, which might have balanced a beneficial effect of first-line HDT for overall survival. This might be exemplified in the trial reported by Santini et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Santini_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Santini-2</LINK>), which compared first-line HDT with second-line HDT after conventional VACOP-B. In this trial, no survival differences could be detected.<BR/>In addition, our analysis of two trials with regard to survival after relapse demonstrated significantly better survival for patients being allocated to the control arm. This may indicate that the outcome of relapsed patients who were previously treated with HDT is poor. This is in accordance to previously published observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Philip-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philip 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mills-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kewalramani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kewalramani 2000</LINK>). Thus, patients who receive HDT as part of their first-line therapy may not be suitable for a second HDT. In contrast, for conventionally treated patients the option of HDT as effective salvage remains. The efficacy of the latter strategy has been previously shown by Philip et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Philip-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philip 1995</LINK>). It demonstrated that HDT is more effective than the DHAP regimen as salvage therapy in chemosensitive patients, who relapsed after initial conventional chemotherapy.<BR/>Our study indicates that HDT-treated patients showed some evidence for improved CR rates as well as improved RFS but no difference for EFS. Although it is generally expected that patients achieving CR are more likely to survive, the higher rate of patients reaching CR did not translate into better survival. A significant advantage favouring HDT in terms of RFS in three trials suggests at least some influence of HDT as first-line therapy in achieving a better eradication of the disease in the subgroup of patients who reached complete remission. On the other hand, the pooled results for DFS, which by definition also comprises only patients in CR, did not indicate any difference. Our findings concerning EFS have to be interpreted cautiously because statistical heterogeneity was apparent, and we could only consider those eleven trials (1,601 patients) that reported or provided data.<BR/>With the availability of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab for both groups, patients with low grade NHL (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2005</LINK>) and patients with aggressive NHL (<LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Coiffier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiffier 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vose-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vose 2001</LINK>), nearly all current and future studies will incorporate Rituximab or similar antibodies. This approach is currently being investigated by the Intergroup-trial S9704. Recently published studies have suggested that dose-dense CHOP variants such as CHOP-14 or CHOEP-14 (<LINK REF="REF-Pfreundschuh-2004_x002d_1" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfreundschuh 2004-1</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pfreundschuh-2004_x002d_2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfreundschuh 2004-2</LINK>) or ACVB (<LINK REF="REF-Tilly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilly 2003</LINK>) might also improve the outcome in aggressive NHL. It remains to be seen whether the combination of dose/time intensified CHOP + Rituximab can be improved by HDT.<BR/>The principle of dose escalation (i.e. dose-dense chemotherapy) has become steadily more popular in various malignancies in recent years. This view is based on the assumption that the reduction of tumour mass might follow a proportional relation between dose and efficacy. Improved supportive care and the accomplishment of toxicities have decreased the mortality of the HDT approach. In this context the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) recommends sequential HDT (HDS) as first-line therapy for patients with high-intermediate and high risk IPI (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2003</LINK>). However, on the basis of our results we cannot confirm this recommendation as we did not find sufficient evidence. This guideline is largely based on a single trial including 98 patients with IPI low to high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni</LINK>) that demonstrated improved EFS without significantly improved OS for the whole trial population. In contrast, when pooling data of three trials applying sequential HDS strategy in our analysis, there was no evidence for a difference between patients receiving HDS and those with standard-dose treatment in terms of OS and EFS. In general, the analysis of different types of HDT including early HDT, late intensification and sequential HDT did not give evidence for a different efficacy or benefit, respectively, for any of these applied strategies.<BR/>Our observed results for patients with NHL seems to be in contrast to the improvements achieved for other malignancies, such as those of high-dose therapy in multiple myeloma, or the escalated BEACOPP regimen in patients with Hodgkin's disease. Regarding these entities, the efficacy of treatment might linearly depend on the dose per time or the accumulation of chemotherapy. Concerning aggressive NHL we might have reached the limitation of the biological activity and efficacy, respectively, of the commonly applied drugs, exemplary in shape of the CHOP regimen. This might explain why the present results do not indicate that the sequence or the time point of HDT administration in the treatment setting influences its efficacy.<BR/>Another explanation for the missed superiority of HDT might be that the efficacy is less following hypotheses such as of Goldie-Coldman and Norton-Simon (<LINK REF="REF-Goldie-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldie 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1986</LINK>), which assume that the addition of further drugs and shorter therapy intervals, respectively, improve tumour cell kill. In contrast, an other model suggests the hypothesis of reversible resistance, where the interval between chemotherapy cycles should allow sufficient time for the reacquisition of tumour sensitivity. However, this was observed mainly in slow growing tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Frei-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frei 1999</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Overall, with respect to the large population included in our analyses and the attempts made to minimise bias and confounding, we conclude that there is no evidence for a general benefit of the therapeutic principle of myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with aggressive NHL as first-line treatment based on the data presently available. Significant improvements for RFS and CR of all available trials are outweighed by the lack of evidence for a benefit concerning the OS in the respective groups. Most importantly, IPI low-risk patients appear to be harmed by HDT in first-line treatment: patients with good risk had better overall outcome after conventional chemotherapy. However, if HDT is employed for high risk patients, physicians should not arbitrarily employ HDT during first-line treatment, but adhere to one of the proven beneficial strategies as a whole, or participate in large trials.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With respect to the latter, a more reasoned developed concept of trial design building upon previous findings is strongly recommended. This should include the harmonization of procedures and definitions, which would facilitate the comparability of results, and improve the assessment of therapeutic intervention. Further research should aim at either reproducing the studies showing positive trends or applying new approaches that do not solely rely on the principle of myeloablation with non-cross resistant drugs.</P>
