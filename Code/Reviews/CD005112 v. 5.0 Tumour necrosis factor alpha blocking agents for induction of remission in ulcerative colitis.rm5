<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the large bowel. Although corticosteroids are effective for treating ulcerative colitis, approximately 20% of patients who respond become sick again when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) is a proinflammatory cykotine that is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. TNF- &#945; blocking drugs may provide an alternative treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drug treatment. This review shows that intravenous infusions of infliximab, a TNF-&#945; blocking agent is effective in inducing clinical remission, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy in patients with active ulcerative colitis whose disease has not responded to conventional treatment. <BR/> </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anti-TNF-&#945; agents have been shown to be effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The role of TNF-&#945; blocking agents in ulcerative colitis is, however, unclear and recent studies have yielded conflicting results. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of TNF-&#945; antibody for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, and to determine adverse events associated with TNF-&#945; antibody treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1984 to 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2004) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials in which patients with active ulcerative colitis (defined by a combination of clinical, radiographic, endoscopic and histologic criteria) were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-&#945; blocking agent in the treatment arm, and to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of each study were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of remission as defined by the primary studies. Other endpoints were clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement as defined by the primary studies; improvement in quality of life as measured by a validated quality of life tool and the occurrence of adverse events. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven randomised controlled trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria. In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease was refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab (three intravenous infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks) was more effective than placebo in inducing clinical remission (Relative Risk (RR) 3.22, 95% CI 2.18 to 4.76); inducing endoscopic remission (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.28); and in inducing clinical response (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.41) at 8 weeks. A single infusion of infliximab was also more effective than placebo in reducing the need for colectomy within 90 days after infusion (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.87). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission, inducing clinical response, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the large bowel. The estimated prevalence of UC ranges from 37 to 246 cases per 100,000 persons in North America (<LINK REF="REF-Loftus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loftus 2004</LINK>). The cause of the disorder is not known. </P>
<P>Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), a pro inflammatory cytokine, is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Breese-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breese 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reimund-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reimund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stack 1997</LINK>). Its importance in the inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been supported by clinical studies showing that suppression of growth velocity in children with IBD may correlate better with circulating TNF-&#945; than with standard inflammatory markers (<LINK REF="REF-Murch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murch 1991</LINK>), and the suppression of TNF-&#945; improves clinical symptoms in adults and children with refractory Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Targan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Targan 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>The efficacy of the chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF IgG1 antibody (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Targan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Targan 1997</LINK>) and the genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody to TNF-&#945;(<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stack 1997</LINK>) have been demonstrated in moderate to severe Crohn's disease. TNF-&#945; can induce mucosal healing and has been shown to have a high steroid-sparing efficacy in active Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hommes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hommes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Targan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Targan 1997</LINK>). A recent systematic review found evidence from one randomised controlled trial that suggested that a single intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab, may be effective for induction of remission in acute Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of TNF-a blocking agents in UC is less clear and recent studies have yielded conflicting results. Whilst a number of uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chey-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chey 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chey-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chey 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kohn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kohn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mamula-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mamula 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2002</LINK>), and a small randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK>) have suggested that there may be a role for TNF-a blocking agents in patients with UC, the findings of one recent randomised controlled trial did not support the use of infliximab for the management of moderately active glucocorticoid-resistant ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>). The blockade of TNF may be associated with the development of serious adverse events including the reactivation of latent tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Keane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keane 2001</LINK>); infusion reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Crandall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crandall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephens 2003</LINK>); acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kugathasan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kugathasan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mamula-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mamula 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaible-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schaible 2000</LINK>); the development of lymphoma (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 2000</LINK>); and formation of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaible-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schaible 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>A systematic review is indicated to summarise the current evidence on the use of TNF-&#945; blocking agents for induction of remission in UC. Where possible, data on outcomes were pooled for meta-analyses. The potential use of TNF-&#945; blocking agents for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis was not the subject of the current review and should be the subject of a separate systematic review.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A. Electronic search<BR/>The following electronic databases were searched for relevant studies:<BR/>1. MEDLINE (1966-2005)<BR/>2. EMBASE (1984-2005)<BR/>3. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2004)<BR/>4. Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group Specialised Trial Register</P>
<P>The search strategy was not limited by language.</P>
<P>B. Reference searching<BR/>The references of all identified studies were inspected for more trials. </P>
<P>C. Abstracts of major gastroenterology meetings <BR/>We originally intended to perform a manual search of abstracts submitted to major gastroenterology meetings between 2000-2005, but after reviewing this potential, it was not possible to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Since there is also some evidence that data from abstracts can be inconsistent with data in published articles (<LINK REF="REF-Pitkin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitkin 1999</LINK>), we excluded data published only in abstract form from further consideration.</P>
<P>D. Personal contacts<BR/>Leaders in the field were contacted to try and identify other studies.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Step 1. Using the above search strategy, potentially relevant papers or abstracts were identified.</P>
<P>Step 2. Two reviewers (AKA and AGT) independently assessed the eligibility of all of these trials identified based upon the specified inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Step 3. The methodological quality of selected trials was independently assessed by the same reviewers using:-</P>
<P>1. Criteria described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>A. Adequate allocation concealment<BR/>B. Unclear allocation concealment<BR/>C. Inadequate allocation concealment</P>
<P>2. The Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>)<BR/>A validated five-point scale measuring a wide range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial: </P>
<P>A. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>B. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate?<BR/>C. Was the study described as double blind? <BR/>D. Was the double blinding well described and appropriate? <BR/>E. Were withdrawals and dropouts described? </P>
<P>Each item will be given a score of 1 if the answer is 'yes' and 0 if the answer is 'no'. One point will be deducted if the described method of randomisation or blinding is inappropriate.</P>
<P>Trials were included if they met all the Cochrane Reviewers handbook criteria A or B; and scored at least 2 points on the Jadad scale.</P>
<P>Disagreements amongst reviewers was discussed, and agreement reached by consensus.</P>
<P>DATA COLLECTION<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract information on relevant features and results of included studies. Two reviewers (AKA and AGT) separately extracted and recorded data on the predefined checklist. Extracted data included the following items:</P>
<P>A. Characteristics of patients: sex, age, disease distribution, duration, and activity index.<BR/>B. Total number of patients originally assigned to each treatment group: to allow an intention to treat analysis.<BR/>C. Intervention: type of tumour necrosis alpha antibody, dose treatment schedule, route of administration.<BR/>D. Control: other drugs or placebo.<BR/>E. Concurrent medication.<BR/>F. Outcomes: time of assessment, disease activity as defined by the authors, quality of life index used, definition of remission rates and adverse events.</P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<BR/>The Cochrane collaboration review (RevMan) software (version 4.2) was used for data analysis. Studies were first reviewed to assess the statistical validity of combining the results of the various trials. Data were analysed according to the intention to treat principle, using the total number of patients randomised as the denominator. Missing values of outcome were assumed to denote a poor outcome. </P>
<P>Dichotomous variables <BR/>Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on the fixed effects model.</P>
<P>Continuous variables<BR/>Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI were calculated.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity<BR/>Heterogeneity amongst trial results was assessed by inspection of graphical presentation and by calculating the chi squared test of heterogeneity. We also used the recently described statistic, I<SUP>2</SUP>, to quantify the effect of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A random effect model was used in situations of unexplained heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Publication bias<BR/>We originally planned to use funnel scatter plots to assess the possibility of publication bias. However, for each outcome whose results could be pooled, there were between 1 to 4 studies which had provided data on that particular outcome, and we considered these to be too few to allow a proper assessment of publication bias. It has been suggested that less than five studies are usually too few to allow the detection of an asymmetric funnel (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis<BR/>There were not enough data to allow any subgroup analyses based on age of participants, disease location, type of tumour necrosis factor-&#945; blocking agent, or the use of concurrent medication.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses <BR/>Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the random effect vs fixed effect models.</P>

<BR/>This study, conducted globally at 62 sites, evaluated 364 patients. All participants had active ulcerative colitis with a Mayo Clinic score (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>) of 6 to 12 points with moderately-to-severely active disease on sigmoidoscopy (endoscopic subscore of at least 2) despite concurrent treatment with corticosteroids, and/or azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Patients who previously had not responded to or could not tolerate corticosteroids (within the past 18 months), or azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (both within the past 5 years), were not required to be taking any concurrent therapy at enrollment. Concomitant therapy with other immunosuppressants, rectally administered corticosteroids, or 5-aminosalicylate-containing medications within 2 weeks of screening was not permitted. Patients previously exposed to infliximab or any other anti-TNF-&#945; agent were excluded.</P>
<P>Eligible patients were randomized (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to receive intravenous infusions of infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg (n = 121), 10 mg/kg (n = 122) or placebo (n = 121) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks through week 46. Patients were followed through week 54. The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 8. Secondary endpoints were clinical response at weeks 30 and 54, clinical remission, and mucosal healing at weeks 8, 30, and 54, clinical remission with discontinuation of corticosteroids at week 30, and clinical response at week 8 according to corticosteroid-refractory status. Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score by at least 3 points and by at least 30 percent and accompanied by a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore by at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point. Mucosal healing was defined as an absolute endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1.</P>

<BR/>This study evaluated 45 patients (age range, 19 to 61) from 10 centres in Sweden and Denmark. Eligible patients had ulcerative colitis verified by a typical clinical history, appearance on endoscopy, and exclusion of an infectious cause. At hospitalization, patients had severe or moderately severe ulcerative colitis according to the Seo index (<LINK REF="REF-Seo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 1992</LINK>). On day 0, all patients were started on intravenous betamethasone 4 mg twice a day. Patients were randomised to receive a single infusion of either infliximab 5 mg/kg (n = 24) or placebo (n = 21) 4 days after initiation of high dose intravenous corticosteroid treatment if they had a fulminant colitis index &#8805; 8 on day 3 or on day 6 to 8 if they had a Seo index of &gt;150 on day 5 to 7. </P>
<P>Decisions about continued medical treatment or colectomy were made on clinical grounds. When switching to oral medication, prednisolone 40 mg daily was given with a dose reduction of 5 mg/day each week. Maintenance treatment with a mesalamine-based drug was started or continued. Azathioprine 1.5 - 2 mg/kg body weight could be added according to the individual investigators's judgement. As prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, trimethoprim 160 mg and sulfamethoxazole 800 mg was prescribed daily for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was colectomy or death within 90 days after infusion. Secondary endpoints were clinical remission (defined as Seo index &lt;150) and endoscopic remission 1 and 3 months after the infusion.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>
<BR/>The study evaluated 43 consecutive patients (age range, 29 to 50.5 years) recruited from four centres in the UK and Germany. Participants had an established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, had failed to respond to conventional treatment and were not in need of urgent colectomy. Patients had to have received conventional treatment with at least 30 mg prednisolone (or equivalent) for at least one week, for relapse, but still had clinical activity that qualified for inclusion in the study (an ulcerative colitis symptom score (UCSS) {<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>} of 6 or more and a sigmoidoscopy score of at least 2 on the Baron scale (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1964</LINK>)). The researchers excluded patients with severe disease rather than ''give them either an unlicensed drug or placebo''. Patients receiving cyclosporine, any agent used to directly reduce TNF-&#945;, as well as those who had received 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine within the last 3 months were excluded. However, patients receiving a stable dose of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine for more than 3 months were not excluded. Prior intestinal resection and the presence of a stoma were also exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Participants were randomised to receive an intravenous infusion of Infliximab 5 mg/kg (n = 23) or placebo (n = 20) at weeks 0 and 2. Primary outcome measures were clinical remission at 6 weeks defined as UCSS &#8804; 2 and endoscopic remission at 6 weeks defined as a Baron score of 0. Secondary outcome measures were changes in UCSS, Baron score, Quality of life (QoL), and serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels and change in daily corticosteroid use. Serious adverse events were defined according to the latest International Committee on Harmonisation, and this included patients who underwent colectomy during the study period and the following 30 days.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK>
<BR/>Eleven patients (8 men, 3 women; age range, 20 to 63) were recruited from North America and Belgium. The researchers originally planned to recruit 60 patients but the study was terminated after the eleventh patient because of slow enrolment. Patients were eligible to participate if they had active ulcerative colitis of at least 2 weeks duration that had been diagnosed by standard clinical, endoscopic and histologic methods. In addition, patients should have received at least 7 days of corticosteroid therapy (&#8805; 40 to &#8804; 60 mg/day, prednisolone equivalent), of which at least 5 days included intravenous administration. Patients should not have had cyclosporine within 3 months of enrolment. Other medications such as 5-aminosalicylates, antibiotics, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, or anti-diarrhoeal drugs were permitted provided doses remained stable during a two week evaluation period. All patients had severe active ulcerative colitis as defined by a modified Truelove and Witts classification score (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1954</LINK>) of &gt;10. Patients were excluded from the study if their disease was so severe that endoscopy was contraindicated, or if they had toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, or disease that did not extend beyond the rectum.</P>
<P>Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous infusion of placebo or infliximab at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg. The primary endpoint of the study was treatment failure at two weeks after infusion of the trial medication. Treatment failure was defined as one or more of the following criteria: failure to achieve a clinical response within two weeks, requiring &gt; 60 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or requiring cyclosporine, undergoing a non-elective colectomy, or dying as a result of ulcerative colitis. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline for the modified Truelove and Witts score, physicians and patients global response, ESR and CRP levels, sigmoidoscopic ratings, and histologic disease activity scores.</P>

<BR/>This study compared infliximab with intravenous methylprednisolone in the treatment of steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis. Twenty patients (age range, 24 to 53) were studied in a single centre in Italy. The male to female ratio was not given. Patients included in the study were steroid-dependent and had: an established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis based on endoscopic and histological findings; moderate to severe disease based on a disease activity index (DAI) score &gt; 6; a minimum of one year continuous steroid dependent ulcerative colitis; a negative stool microscopy; a negative immunohistochemistry for CMV on bowel biopsy; an absence of any serious infection in the preceding 3 months; no need for urgent colectomy. Patients were randomised to receive either infliximab infusions at 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2,and 6 or methylprednisolone at 0.7 to 1 mg/kg daily for one week followed by a tapering regime up to the minimal dose required to remain symptom free.</P>

<BR/>This study compared infliximab with high-dose prednisolone for the induction of remission in patients with acute ulcerative colitis who were not steroid-refractory. Thirteen patients (6 men, 7 women; age range 21 to 78 years) were recruited from Germany. Patients were eligible if they had acute severe ulcerative colitis with a modified Truelove and Witts activity score &gt; 10, if they had a flare persisting for at least 2 weeks, and if they were not receiving immunosuppressants, immunomodulators or more than 10 mg per day prednisolone. Eligible patients were refractory to optimal doses of oral 5-aminosalicylates and topical therapy with 5-aminosalicylates. Exclusion criteria were severe disease contraindicating endoscopy, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, or an inflammatory disease not extending beyond the rectum. Concomitant steroid medication was discontinued in all patients at study outset.</P>
<P>Eligible patients were randomised to receive either intravenous infliximab 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks or prednisolone at 1.5 mg/kg daily for two weeks, followed by 1 mg/kg for one week, followed by a tapering regimen with a weekly reduction of 5 mg. The main outcome measure was therapy success defined as clinical response in terms of a decrease of more than 5 points from baseline score (modified Truelove and Witts activity score), and to less than 10 points total after three weeks and after thirteen weeks, and no need to start or increase prednisolone dosage or to perform colectomy. A secondary endpoint was remission at thirteen weeks. Remission was defined according to a criteria described by the gastrointestinal advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration as the absence of inflammatory symptoms (rectal bleeding or diarrhoea) in conjunction with evidence of mucosal healing (absence of ulceration, significant granularity or friability).</P>

<P>In all the seven included studies, allocation of participants to infliximab or control was random but five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armuzzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armuzzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) did not provide sufficient information on the method of randomisation.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We included seven randomized controlled trials on the use of TNF-&#945; blocking agents for inducing remission or clinical response in ulcerative colitis. All the included studies had compared the chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF-&#945; IgG1 antibody (infliximab) with either placebo or corticosteroids. Five studies compared infliximab with placebo in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease was refractory to conventional treatment, and two studies compared infliximab with corticosteroids. The total number of participants in the included studies was 860. </P>
<P>EFFICACY</P>
<P>Infliximab versus Placebo</P>
<P>a. Clinical Remission<BR/>Data were available from four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) with 816 participants (531 infliximab and 285 placebo) on this outcome. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) were quite large (n = 364 &amp; 364) and both showed a statistically significant benefit for infliximab. The number of patients in the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>) was relatively small (n = 45 &amp; 43) and neither study showed a statistically significant benefit for infliximab over placebo. The two studies by Rutgeerts et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) used a similar study design but the other studies used different measures of disease activity, measured outcomes at different time points, and used different dosing regimes. We therefore felt it was appropriate to statistically combine only the results of the studies by Rutgeerts et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>). The results of the other two studies are reported separately. A total of 728 patients (484 infliximab and 244 placebo) were included in the meta-analysis on this outcome. The results of the meta-analysis showed that infliximab was effective for induction of clinical remission at 8 weeks (Relative Risk (RR) 3.22, 95% CI 2.18 to 4.76; NNT = 5). The results of the primary studies were in the same direction (favouring infliximab) but the analysis suggested a degree of heterogeneity with regard to this variable (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 71.6%). Using the random effects model in a sensitivity analysis did not make any significant difference to the results (RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.67; NNT = 5). There was no significant change in the results when a subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received 5 mg/kg of infliximab (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.36 to 5.31; NNT = 4). In the studies by Jarnerot et al and Probert et al (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>) which respectively measured the outcome at 3 months and 6 weeks, the trend of the results appeared to favour infliximab (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.59 to 11.64 for the Jarnerot study, and RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.03 for the Probert study) but as earlier stated, neither study demonstrated a statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>b. Endoscopic Remission/ mucosal healing<BR/>This was assessed in the same four trials that assessed clinical remission (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>). Again the two small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>) did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit whereas the two larger studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) did. For the same reasons as above, we only combined data from the two studies by Rutgeerts et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>). The results of the meta-analysis showed that infliximab was effective in inducing endoscopic remission at 8 weeks (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.28; NNT = 4). No heterogeneity existed across the trials with regard to this variable (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). The results of the studies by Jarnerot et al (outcome measured at 3 months) and Probert et al (outcome measured at 6 weeks) were respectively RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.59 to 11.64; and RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.27.</P>

Infliximab was effective in producing a clinical response (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.41; NNT = 4). The results of the two studies were in the same direction (favouring infliximab) and the Chi squared test was not statistically significant (P = 0.18), but the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic suggested that moderate heterogeneity existed across the two trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44.7%). Using the random effect model in a sensitivity analysis did not make any significant difference to the results (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.56; NNT = 4).</P>
<P>d. Treatment success<BR/>Outcome was assessed in this way in one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK>) with 11 participants (8 infliximab and 3 placebo). There was no statistically significant difference between infliximab and placebo (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.28 to 57.98).</P>
<P>e. Colectomy<BR/>Data were available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>) with 45 patients (24 infliximab and 21 placebo). There was a significant reduction in colectomy rates with infliximab (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.87).</P>
<P>f. Quality of Life<BR/>Data were available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>) with 43 patients (23 infliximab and 20 placebo). The inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) and EuroQol were used to assess quality of life. Using the IBDQ, there was no statistically significant difference between infliximab and placebo (Weighted mean difference (WMD) 11.0, 95% CI -11.84 to 33.84). The results of the EuroQol were not statistically significant.</P>

<P>b. Endoscopic Remission<BR/>Data were available from the same study as assessed clinical remission (<LINK REF="STD-Ochsenkuhn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenkuhn 2004</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference between infliximab and prednisolone (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.44).</P>

One patient treated with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>) developed life threatening sepsis. Five of 7 patients receiving oral prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Ochsenkuhn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenkuhn 2004</LINK>) developed Cushing-like symptoms, 2 developed facial acne and 1 developed dysphoria. Adverse events were not mentioned in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Armuzzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armuzzi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK> (follow up 54 weeks) and <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK> (follow up 30 weeks), the proportion of patients with adverse events were generally similar in the placebo and two infliximab groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>, one patient treated with infliximab developed tuberculosis and in <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>, one patient receiving infliximab developed histoplasmosis and died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. The incidence of infusion reactions in the two studies ranged from 8 to 12% and was similar in the placebo and infliximab groups. In both studies the occurrence of newly positive results for antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded anti-DNA antibodies occurred more frequently in the infliximab groups than the placebo groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>, two patients developed possible delayed hypersensitivity reactions (1 in placebo &amp; 1 in infliximab group).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>TNF-&#945; blocking agents are effective for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2003</LINK>) and recent reports have suggested that they may have a similar role in the management of ulcerative colitis. This review summarises the randomised controlled trials which have addressed this question. The main reported outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic remission measured by validated disease activity indices, as well as adverse events. </P>
<P>All 7 randomised controlled trials identified examined the efficacy of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease was refractory to conventional treatment including corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylate agents or immunosuppressive agents. No trials of other TNF-&#945; blocking agents were identified. Five of the included studies compared infliximab with placebo. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Probert-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Probert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK>) failed to show any benefit of infliximab but both had relatively small numbers of patients (n = 43 &amp; 13 respectively) raising the possibility of a Type II error. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Sands-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sands 2001</LINK> originally planned to recruit 60 patients but was terminated prematurely because of slow enrolment. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>) was also relatively small (n = 45). This study showed a significant reduction in colectomy rate with infliximab but the follow up period was only 13 weeks and it remains unclear whether colectomy can be prevented in the long term by infliximab. The two larger studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) both showed a clear benefit of infliximab over placebo in terms of clinical response and induction of clinical and endoscopic remission. However, colectomy rates were not reported for the ACT1 and ACT2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>). The other two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armuzzi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Armuzzi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenkuhn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenkuhn 2004</LINK>) compared infliximab with corticosteroids. They both failed to show any significant difference between infliximab and corticosteroids but both had small numbers of patients (n = 20 &amp; 13 respectively) again raising the possibility of a Type II error. From patient's perspective one of the most important aspects of a chronic illness and its treatment is the effect on quality of life. Only 3 of the 7 included studies reported this as an outcome measure and we would encourage future researchers to include it in their study design. Quality of life was assessed in the ACT1 and ACT2 studies and reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) but the data are not yet published as a full manuscript. </P>
<P>Short term adverse events related to infliximab were usually mild (headache, pruritis, arthralgia, upper respiratory or urinary infection). Severe adverse events were rarely reported. Patients receiving infliximab were more likely to develop antinuclear antibodies or double-stranded anti-DNA antibodies and those developing positive antibodies to infliximab were more likely to develop an infusion reaction. There were 2 reports of possible delayed hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving infliximab. There have been previous concerns about the risk of serious infections including tuberculosis with infliximab. <LINK REF="REF-Keane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keane 2001</LINK> analysed all reports of tuberculosis after infliximab therapy received through the MedWatch spontaneous reporting system of the US Food and Drug Administration. By May 2001 there were 70 reported cases, a much higher rate than the reported frequency of opportunistic infections or the background rate of tuberculosis. It was recommended that patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis before receiving infliximab. There has also been concern about a possible association between TNF-a blocking agents and lymphoma as found in a recent MedWatch post market adverse event surveillance system run by the US Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). Although there were no reported cases of lymphoma in any of the 7 studies included in this review the follow up period may well have been insufficient to identify affected patients.</P>
<P>TNF-&#945; was not previously thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The data presented in these studies suggest otherwise. Ulcerative colitis was thought to result from a colonic mucosal T-helper-2 immune response, but this would argue against an important role of TNF-&#945;. Rutgeerts et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) suggested that the mechanism of action of infliximab in ulcerative colitis could include induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells expressing membrane-bound TNF-&#945;, as in Crohn's disease, but at present this is purely speculation.<BR/> <BR/>We can conclude from this review that infliximab is effective at inducing remission or clinical response in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who are refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. Infliximab may also be effective at helping to prevent colectomy in the short term but further studies with longer follow up are required to show whether colectomy can be prevented in the long term. The earlier small studies did not show any benefit with infliximab emphasising the importance of conducting well designed adequately powered studies. We suggest that assessment of quality of life should be included as an important outcome measure in future studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this systematic review and meta-analyses suggest that infliximab is effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is resistant to conventional therapy using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. In such patients, infliximab was more effective than placebo for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission, clinical response and helping to avoid colectomy in the short term. In the two large studies by Rutgeerts et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>), there was no statistically significant difference between a dose of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. We recommend an intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg. The schedule of therapy was not consistent between studies. In the two largest studies which demonstrated the largest effect (<LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT1" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005-ACT2" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005 ACT2</LINK>) infliximab was given at 0, 2 and 6 weeks to induce remission, but in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jarnerot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jarnerot 2005</LINK>) a single infusion of infliximab was used as a 'rescue therapy' in patients with acute disease judged to have failed to respond to high dose corticosteroids. There is, therefore, insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on the ideal dosing schedule. We did not find any evidence to suggest that infliximab is more effective than high-dose corticosteroids in patients who are not steroid-refractory. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with some of the uncommon adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections. We found no evidence to support the use of other TNF-&#945; agents in acute ulcerative colitis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Earlier small studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between infliximab and placebo for the induction of remission. These studies probably lacked adequate statistical power to allow the detection of such a difference. It is therefore important for researchers in this area to ensure adequate sample size by performing <I>a priori</I> power and sample size calculations. More recent larger studies clearly demonstrated a benefit for infliximab in patients who had previously received corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. It is unclear from the results of included studies whether both corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents should be used prior to infliximab therapy. The question of when it is appropriate to use infliximab in clinical practice should be addressed in future studies. As stated in the 'Implications for practice' section, there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on ideal dosing schedule, and this area should be investigated in future studies. The fact that infliximab is effective in ulcerative colitis does not necessarily mean that other TNF-&#945; blocking agents will also be effective, and these agents should be tested in randomized trials. Further long term studies are required to determine whether infliximab can prevent colectomy in the long term, and also to evaluate potential long term adverse events. Future studies should also include assessment of quality of life as an important outcome and such studies should be designed to ensure that there is adequate statistical power to detect any differences between groups with regard to this outcome. As in Crohn's disease, there is an absence of proper randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of infliximab in the paediatric population. Well designed clinical trials investigating the use of infliximab in childhood inflammatory bowel disease are needed.</P>
