<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to establish if Early Supported Discharge (ESD) services can result in a better patient recovery and if they are as acceptable and affordable as usual services.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Services that try to offer stroke patients an earlier discharge from hospital with rehabilitation provided in the community have been termed Early Supported Discharge (ESD) services. ESD services are usually provided by multidisciplinary teams of therapists, nurses, and doctors who work in a co-ordinated manner through regular meetings. They aim to allow patients to return home from hospital earlier than usual and also to receive more rehabilitation in the familiar environment of their own home.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 17 clinical trials recruiting 2422 stroke patients (searching completed to January 2017). Patients who were recruited tended to have a moderate degree of disability (able to walk with assistance) and be sufficiently well to consider returning home. We categorised services as those based on a multidisciplinary ESD team (with different levels of co-ordination and delivery) and those with no multidisciplinary team co-ordination (no ESD team).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The length of initial stay in hospital was reduced by approximately five days for the ESD group. At an average of six months after their stroke ESD patients were more likely to be living at home (an extra five patients living at home for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). They were also more likely to be independent in daily activities (an extra six patients independent for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). We identified no apparent hazards in terms of patient mood or quality of life, carer mood or quality of life, or the risk of readmission to hospital. The greatest reductions in disability seemed to be present in trials based around a co-ordinated ESD team. When compared with usual care, costs of ESD services ranged from a reduction to a modest increase.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was downgraded to 'moderate' for the main outcomes of death, discharge home or disability. This was because it was impossible to hide the treating service from participants or healthcare workers. These conclusions were not dependent on trials judged to be lower quality because of poor design or missing data. More information was missing for some of the other outcome measures, which we have downgraded to low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Appropriately resourced ESD services with co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input can reduce disability and the length of time in hospital at least for a selected group of people with stroke. Results are unclear for services that are not based on a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input. We did not identify any substantial harmful effects.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-13 15:27:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (January 2017), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched January 2017), MEDLINE in Ovid (searched January 2017), Embase in Ovid (searched January 2017), CINAHL in EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to December 2016), and Web of Science (to January 2017). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched six trial registries (March 2017). We also performed citation tracking of included studies, checked reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted trialists.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-06-02 13:22:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting stroke patients in hospital to receive either conventional care or any service intervention that has provided rehabilitation and support in a community setting with an aim of reducing the duration of hospital care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:43:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary patient outcome was the composite end-point of death or long-term dependency recorded at the end of scheduled follow-up. Two review authors scrutinised trials, categorised them on their eligibility and extracted data. Where possible we sought standardised data from the primary trialists. We analysed the results for all trials and for subgroups of patients and services, in particular whether the intervention was provided by a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team (co-ordinated ESD team) or not. We assessed risk of bias for the included trials and used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:43:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 17 trials, recruiting 2422 participants, for which outcome data are currently available. Participants tended to be a selected elderly group of stroke survivors with moderate disability. The ESD group showed reductions in the length of hospital stay equivalent to approximately six days (mean difference (MD) -5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3 to -8 days; P &lt; 0.0001; moderate-grade evidence). The primary outcome was available for 16 trials (2359 participants). Overall, the odds ratios (OR) for the outcome of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up (median 6 months; range 3 to 12) was OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.01, moderate-grade evidence) which equates to five fewer adverse outcomes per 100 patients receiving ESD. The results for death (16 trials; 2116 participants) and death or requiring institutional care (12 trials; 1664 participants) were OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.40, P = 0.81, moderate-grade evidence) and OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, P = 0.02, moderate-grade evidence), respectively. Small improvements were also seen in participants' extended activities of daily living scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.25, P = 0.01, low-grade evidence) and satisfaction with services (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.38, P = 0.02, low-grade evidence). We saw no clear differences in participants' activities of daily living scores, patients subjective health status or mood, or the subjective health status, mood or satisfaction with services of carers. We found low-quality evidence that the risk of readmission to hospital was similar in the ESD and conventional care group (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.51, P = 0.59, low-grade evidence). The evidence for the apparent benefits were weaker at one- and five-year follow-up. Estimated costs from six individual trials ranged from 23% lower to 15% greater for the ESD group in comparison to usual care.</P>
<P>In a series of pre-planned analyses, the greatest reductions in death or dependency were seen in the trials evaluating a co-ordinated ESD team with a suggestion of poorer results in those services without a co-ordinated team (subgroup interaction at P = 0.06). Stroke patients with mild to moderate disability at baseline showed greater reductions in death or dependency than those with more severe stroke (subgroup interaction at P = 0.04).<BR/>

<P>Appropriately resourced ESD services with co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input provided for a selected group of stroke patients can reduce long-term dependency and admission to institutional care as well as reducing the length of hospital stay.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:44:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is a global healthcare problem and in most countries is one of the leading causes of death and acquired adult disability (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>). Stroke is also expensive and consumes 5% of all health service resources within the UK National Health Service (<LINK REF="REF-Saka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saka 2009</LINK>). Despite major advances in the medical management of stroke, the majority of people with continue to rely on post-stroke rehabilitation interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2011</LINK>). Conventionally, rehabilitation after stroke is provided in hospital. Thus, in-patient care of disabled stroke patients accounts for much of the substantial economic costs (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rehabiliation in hospital can achieve good clinical outcomes. A recent updated systematic review evaluating in-patient stroke care has indicated that organised in-patient (stroke unit) care is effective in reducing death and disability (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2013</LINK>). However, many important questions about stroke service provision remain unanswered. In particular, are there effective alternatives to in-patient care and how can care be best provided after discharge from hospital?</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous review focused on those systems of care which have been set up as complete alternatives to in-patient care, that is, services such as 'hospital at home', which aim to prevent stroke patients being admitted to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 1999</LINK>). A second approach has been to develop services that may accelerate the discharge of patients already admitted to hospital. These services have variously been termed 'early supported discharge (ESD) schemes', 'early home supported discharge services', 'accelerated discharge schemes' and 'post-discharge support services', and form the basis of this review. This review focuses on the effectiveness of such early supported discharge services.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:44:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the main areas of concern to patients and carers is the organisation of discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>); moving from being cared for in hospital by a team of professionals, to being at home and the responsibility of themselves and their carers. ESD services were developed to try and improve the transition between hospital and community by accelerating discharge home from hospital but providing more continuity of rehabilitation in the home setting. Some arguments in favour of ESD services are summarised as better partnership between the patient and therapist, helping patient motivation by focusing on more realistic rehabilitation goals, providing rehabilitation in a more relevant context, encouraging more focus on self-directed activities, and fostering a more realistic understanding of future recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:44:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although arguments have been made for and against ESD services (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2007</LINK>), the basic question - whether a policy of early hospital discharge with support is as effective and efficient as conventional hospital care, discharge planning, and post-discharge care - needs to be tested in rigorous trials and systematic reviews. This remains an area of great clinical interest that features in clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2008</LINK>), and is the subject of ongoing trials.</P>

<P>We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We identified the method of concealment of treatment allocation, the presence of an intention-to-treat analysis, and the presence of blinding of outcome assessment as potentially important factors for sensitivity analyses, but we did not use them as exclusion criteria.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-07-10 13:57:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary patient outcome was the composite end-point of death or long-term dependency recorded at the end of scheduled follow-up. Where death, dependency or institutionalisation after the end of scheduled follow-up were reported, we analysed these using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
<P>We sought data on initial stroke severity using the most widely available marker of functional ability (Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score during the first week post stroke). Most trials could easily provide this as the Barthel Index at randomisation. However, in three trials randomisation frequently took place later (occasionally up to six weeks post stroke) (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>). Where possible, we estimated the baseline Barthel assuming a typical recovery of one Barthel point per week, e.g. Barthel of 14/20 at week four indicates an initial score of 10/20.</P>
<P>Many secondary outcomes were expressed as continuous outcome scores. We aimed to analyse these as the mean and standard deviation of the score. Where only medians were available we assumed these were approximate to the mean. Where only interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported we inferred the standard deviation as follows: the IQR will incorporate 50% of the distribution of data compared with standard deviation, which can be expected to include 70% (+ or - 35%) of the distribution. Therefore, assuming a normal distribution then one standard deviation should equal the IQR/(2 x 0.7). Where no other data were provided with the mean value, we inferred the standard deviation as being at least as large as the comparable trials using the same measure. We used sensitivity analyses to check the impact of data assumptions.</P>

We analysed binary outcome data using the OR and 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model first but replaced this with a random-effects model if there was significant heterogeneity. If possible, we analysed continuous outcome data (e.g. ADL scores) using the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for identical outcomes and the standard mean difference (SMD) where different measurement techniques were used to measure the same outcome domain. We used a fixed-effect model first but replaced this with a random-effects model if there was significant heterogeneity. We had to reverse several outcome scores (e.g. mood scores) to ensure all scores compared were operating in the same direction. This was done by subtracting the observed score from the maximum possible score. Where multi-arm studies were identified we planned to combine the comparable groups.

<P>Previous subgroup analyses were based on patient characteristics of age, gender, presence of carer, and stroke severity (Barthel Index in the first week).

We aimed to update these if the relevant data were available. We initially trichotomised stroke severity and age but subsequently collapsed these into two groups for simplicity and consistency with previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The search strategy for the second version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-ESD-trialists-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESD trialists 2005</LINK>) identified 29 potentially eligible trials of which three (<LINK REF="STD-Ayrshire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ayrshire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Auckland-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Auckland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cumbria-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cumbria 2004</LINK>) were in the early stages of planning but never started. The original assessors agreed on the inclusion of 10 trials, the exclusion of 14 trials and disagreed on two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Akershus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Akershus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-York-1986" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1986</LINK>). After discussion and obtaining more information, both these trials were considered eligible but one was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-New-York-1986" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1986</LINK>) as no outcome information has ever been identified (see below). Therefore, the previous version of this review included 11 trials (<LINK REF="REF-ESD-trialists-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESD trialists 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the previous update (<LINK REF="REF-ESD-trialists-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESD trialists 2012</LINK>), we identified three new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Copenhagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Copenhagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glostrup-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glostrup 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>) plus newly published data for three previously included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Montreal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montreal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>).

<P>The services under comparison are outlined in detail (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We were particularly interested in establishing the degree of co-ordination and organisation of the community and hospital services (i.e. whether patients received care from a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team with some specialist interest in stroke which met on a regular basis). By this definition the following classifications can be made.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention services</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Early supported discharge (ESD) team co-ordination and delivery: in nine trials the ESD service comprised a multidisciplinary team which co-ordinated discharge from hospital, post-discharge care and provided rehabilitation and patient care at home or in a community setting (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Copenhagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Copenhagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montreal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montreal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newcastle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newcastle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1998</LINK>). The multidisciplinary team met on a regular basis to plan patient care.</LI>
<LI>ESD team co-ordination: in four trials discharge home and the immediate post-discharge care was planned and supervised by a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>). However, care was subsequently handed over to existing community-based agencies who provided continuing rehabilitation and support at home. These community-based agencies did not always provide co-ordinated multidisciplinary team care (i.e. input from a multidisciplinary team which met on a regular basis to plan patient care). However, in some trials the community teams were also multidisciplinary in nature and focused on working with stroke patients early after discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo 2000</LINK>). One recent trial randomised patients to one of two different forms of ESD service (<LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>); based in a community day unit (<LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014-_x002d_-Day-unit" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014 - Day unit</LINK>) or in their homes with home-visits from the community health team (<LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014-_x002d_-Home-care" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014 - Home care</LINK>). Although both met the definition of an ESD service they have, where possible, been analysed separately to reflect this difference in design.</LI>
<LI>No ESD team: in four trials, patients had access to multidisciplinary team care in hospital, but this ended at hospital discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akershus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Akershus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATTEND-pilot-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ATTEND pilot 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bangkok-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bangkok 2002</LINK>). Their subsequent care was provided by a range of community stroke services which were; not planned or provided by a co-ordinated team (<LINK REF="STD-Akershus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Akershus 1998</LINK>), were provided by trained healthcare volunteers (<LINK REF="STD-Bangkok-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bangkok 2002</LINK>), or provided through supported training by a physiotherapist for patients and family (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATTEND-pilot-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ATTEND pilot 2015</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The boundary between groups 1 and 2 does not appear clear cut but indicates a spectrum of approaches where an ESD team plans and co-ordinates discharge, provides early post-discharge rehabilitation, and then hands over care to other community services.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ESD team structure, practices and procedures</HEADING>
<P>Details of ESD team practices can best be obtained from the original trials. However, we previously developed a summary description of the services to indicate the type of service provided. From recorded staff contact time, we calculated standardised staffing levels (whole time equivalents (WTE) sufficient to manage a notional 100 new patients per year) (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montreal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montreal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newcastle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newcastle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1998</LINK>), or a typical team caseload (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>). We assumed staff would have a 35-hour working week with 20 hours direct contact time and 10 hours indirect contact time.</P>
<P>Typical ESD teams had approximately 3.1 WTE staff (range 2.6 to 4.6) as follows; medical 0.1, nursing (ranged from 0 to 1.2), physiotherapy 1.0, occupational therapy 1.0, speech and language therapy 0.3, assistant 0.4. Variable levels of social work (0 to 0.5 WTE) and secretarial support were also available (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ESD teams could either have a community (community in-reach) or hospital base (hospital out-reach) with experience in stroke rehabilitation/neurological rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Copenhagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Copenhagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montreal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montreal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newcastle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newcastle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>). All co-ordinated their work through regular multidisciplinary team meetings. A typical approach would involve the early identification of the patient in hospital and a visit from the key worker (case manager) from the ESD team. Discharge was planned with the patient and carer, often involving a pre-discharge home visit (attended by the patient) or environmental visit (not attended by the patient). Team input typically began on the day of discharge and could be provided as required. In practice this ranged from daily input to four to five days per week. Typically teams would agree recovery goals with the patient and negotiate the termination of services within three months (which would be tapered off as goals were achieved). Many teams used a patient-held medical record and provided a formal discharge summary at the end of input.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Control services</HEADING>
<P>These were categorised on whether organised stroke unit care was available to patients prior to discharge (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In 12 trials, all patients were recruited from a stroke unit or neurological rehabilitation unit staffed by a multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akershus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Akershus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATTEND-pilot-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ATTEND pilot 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Copenhagen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Copenhagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>) or most patients (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>). Five trials recruited a minority of patients from a multidisciplinary stroke unit setting (<LINK REF="STD-Bangkok-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bangkok 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montreal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montreal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newcastle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newcastle 1997</LINK>). Therefore, the control service was frequently provided in general wards. Discharge arrangements were variable in the control services with a minority undergoing a pre-discharge home visit and variable follow-up arrangements.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Settings of services</HEADING>
<P>The trials identified come from nine countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, India, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Thailand, UK). Fourteen trials were established in city hospitals servicing largely urban areas while two (<LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>) covered a mixture of rural and urban areas. An additional trial recruited only patients from rural addresses who were admitted to a large urban hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Patients had a clinical diagnosis of stroke and the average patient age in the trials ranged from 60 to 80 years. There appeared to be a degree of selection of patients deemed suitable for the ESD services that was based on need (persisting disability), stability of their medical condition, and practicability (living within the local area). The average (mean or median) initial Barthel index (at the time of patient recruitment) in each study ranged from 10/20 to 19/20 with a lower IQR limit of 6 to 16/20 and an upper value of 14 to 19/20. Thus the typical patient population had an initial Barthel index of 14/20 with an IQR of 10 to 18.</P>
<P>We repeated this process to estimate the Barthel index (or equivalent score) at the time of discharge for those trials where the ADL score was recorded within one week prior to discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Aveiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bergen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1997" TYPE="STUDY">London 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newcastle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newcastle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondheim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Trondheim 2004</LINK>). The average (mean or median) initial Barthel index (within one week prior to discharge) in each study ranged from 13/20 to 19/20 with a lower IQR limit of 10/20 to 16/20 and an upper value of 15/20 to 19/20.

<P>Some commentators have criticised the original inclusion of trials that did not incorporate a robust multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme in the community (<LINK REF="STD-Akershus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Akershus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Adelaide-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ATTEND-pilot-2015" TYPE="STUDY">ATTEND pilot 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bangkok-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bangkok 2002</LINK>). The remaining 13 trials are much more typical of what has become accepted as a 'core' ESD service (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2011</LINK>). If the analyses are restricted to those 13 trials the results are more convincing for ESD services: death (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.11; P = 0.17; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>), death or institutional care (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87; P = 0.003; <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>), death or dependency (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.89; P = 0.002; <LINK REF="CMP-011.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.3</LINK>) and reduction in length of stay (MD 6 days; 95% CI 3 to 9; P &lt; 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-011.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.4</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is clear from this analysis of the randomised trials that services aiming to accelerate discharge from hospital can bring about a reduction in the length of hospital stay and that this reduction can be substantial. This updated analysis demonstrates that patients receiving ESD services were more likely to be independent and living at home six months after stroke than those who received conventional services. ESD patients scored better on extended ADL scores and were more likely to express satisfaction with services. Although we have limited information available, we have been unable to confirm earlier concerns about the impact of ESD services on the mood and well-being of carers (in terms of subjective health score, mood, or satisfaction with services).</P>
<P>Economic analyses were carried out in six trials. Although the underlying costs and assumptions were different for each analysis, all concluded that the opportunity savings from hospital bed days released tended to be greater than, or similar to, the cost of the ESD service. Realising such cost savings in practice can be difficult but ESD services appear to offer one way to manage rising demand for a finite number of hospital beds.</P>
<P>The particular component of an ESD service responsible for the improvement in functional outcome seen remains unclear. Providing rehabilitation in the setting of the patients' own home is thought to be a significant contributing factor. It has also been suggested that patients receiving ESD services overall receive greater input from rehabilitation therapists and for a longer duration than those receiving conventional care. However, any potential increase in rehabilitation input does not appear to affect overall cost-efficacy of ESD services in economic analyses.</P>
<P>In conclusion, appropriately resourced and co-ordinated ESD teams can offer a further effective service option for a selected group of people with stroke and should be considered in addition to organised inpatient (stroke unit) care as part of a comprehensive stroke service.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:45:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When interpreting the results of this review it is important to remember that the basic question addressed was whether a policy of early hospital discharge with support could be as effective and efficient as conventional care. Therefore, our inclusion criteria were broad and focused on trials that compared two policies of care for stroke patients in hospital: 1) conventional care, that is, the usual hospital care and discharge procedures; and 2) an alternative system of care that aimed to provide an earlier discharge with rehabilitation or support, or both, in a home-based setting ('early supported discharge': ESD). Within this broad question we had anticipated that a 'core' group of trials would be testing a specialist multidisciplinary ESD team that had been established to provide this form of care to stroke patients. However, we also wished to retain the option of including other trials where a policy of early discharge was tested in other ways. The advantage of this broad approach is that it can allow us to examine both the effectiveness of a reasonably specific co-ordinated ESD team 'package' of care, and also to explore the broader service factors (both inpatient and outpatient) that may influence patient outcomes. One potential hazard is that it is difficult to conduct such an exercise in a truly a priori and objective manner. The current update has maintained the original review structure.</P>
<P>In developing a clear question to guide this review, we have chosen to focus on the intention of the service intervention and to avoid terms such as 'hospital at home' which may have a different meaning to different people. However, we acknowledge that some services aim to both help avoid hospital admission and accelerate discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Wade-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1985</LINK>). We have not excluded any trials from the review solely on the basis of their service having this dual function. We have also focused the review on services for people with stroke. There are several potentially complementary trials that have recruited a mixed geriatric medical patient population. These have been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2009</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update identified four new trials (663 participants) and did not alter the main conclusions in comparison with the previous version of the review. While we acknowledge that the total amount of data available is limited (17 trials; 2422 participants), there do appear to be some general conclusions that can be drawn.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Most of the evidence of benefit of ESD services come from trials of a multidisciplinary ESD team whose work is co-ordinated through regular meetings.</LI>
<LI>The typical multidisciplinary ESD team comprised physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy staff with medical, nursing and social work support.</LI>
<LI>Such services appeared to be effective even in comparison with a standard service based on care in a stroke unit.</LI>
<LI>Although we could not find evidence that the setting of the service (hospital out-reach or community in-reach) influenced outcomes, all the ESD teams reported here had a specialist interest in stroke or rehabilitation, or both.</LI>
<LI>All trials recruited a selected subgroup (on average 33%) of people with stroke usually living in an urban setting. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on ESD services for those living in a more dispersed rural setting.</LI>
<LI>Most of the evidence of ESD benefit appears to be for people with moderate disability (initial Barthel index of &gt; 9/20), although the balance of cost and benefit is not clear for this subgroup. For people with more severe disability the substantial saving in bed-days may well be outweighed by a risk of poorer patient outcomes. We, therefore, cannot exclude the possibility that the clinical benefits enjoyed by the moderate disability subgroup required a net increase in rehabilitation input while the main cost savings (in terms of bed days) came from the severe subgroup.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Although the quality of the evidence in general was good, many of the trials were completed over 10 years ago. In many countries the last decade has seen a significant overhaul of stroke services to enable greater access to hyperacute therapies (e.g. thrombolysis or thrombectomy). However, only a small proportion of people with stroke will be eligible for such therapies, with the great majority continuing to rely on post-stroke rehabilitation to improve functional outcomes.</P>
<P>The conclusions about the potential benefit of ESD services appear to be robust. The results are strengthened if analyses focus on trials with clearly concealed randomisation, blinded outcome assessment, and near-complete follow-up (10 trials; 1318 participants), or on the 'core' group of trials (13 trials; 1902 participants) testing a co-ordinated ESD team.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:46:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Through a thorough searching process and well-established personal connections with researchers in this field we are confident that we should have identified all potentially relevant studies. However, for three studies we did not have sufficient information to carry out a preliminary classification according to our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Edirne-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Edirne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tian-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 2015</LINK>). We realise the absence of data from these studies in our meta-analysis may potentially have introduced bias.</P>
<P>As discussed, our inclusion criteria with respect to the service intervention were deliberately broad. We recognise that interpretation of patient and service characteristics raises the potential risk of a post-hoc explanation of results. However, we tried as far as possible to plan analyses a priori.</P>
<P>A small proportion of patient data was missing for our dichotomous outcomes of death (57 intervention participants; 53 controls), death or institutionalisation (24 intervention participants; 19 controls), and death or dependency (99 intervention participants; 84 controls). In these instances we assumed the participants to be alive and independent. Similarly for continuous outcome data, where standard deviations were not reported they were inferred from the interquartile ranges (IQR) or alternatively estimated as being at least as large as the comparable trials using the same measure (see <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK>). Whilst we recognise that this may have introduced potential bias to our results, we believe that including imputed and estimated data were preferable to excluding data from participants or studies.</P>
<P>Finally, the trialists who authored this review were in general the authors of the included trials. However, decisions on trial selection and data extraction were arranged to avoid trialists making decisions about their own trial.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-19 11:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several systematic reviews have addressed the topic of how to improve the transition of discharge home for patients in hospital. A systematic review of discharge planning strategies for medical patients concluded that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient may bring about reductions in length of hospital stay and readmission rates (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2016</LINK>). A systematic review of trials of generic (non-stroke specific) early discharge hospital at home services concluded that such services could speed up discharge home, but commented on the limited evidence available (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2009</LINK>). A more recent stroke-specific literature review on team co-ordinated early supported discharge again concluded that this could be an effective approach for a selected patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2016</LINK>). None of these reviews have included such a comprehensive group of stroke-specific trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:45:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selected stroke patients in hospital who received input from an early supported discharge (ESD) service returned home earlier than those receiving conventional care. They were also more likely to be independent and living at home six months after their stroke and to express satisfaction with the services they received. There were no apparent adverse effects in terms of hospital readmissions or on the subjective health status or mood of patients or carers. The apparent benefits of ESD services are largely derived from trials of services provided by co-ordinated ESD teams and recruiting participants with less severe disability.</P>
<P>Although clarity around the specific models of ESD is required, the evidence summarised appears to be sufficient to encourage piloting of stroke ESD services as part of a comprehensive system of stroke care. A consensus on key elements of an ESD service has been developed by the original trialists to facilitate successful implementation at a national and international level (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2011</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-10 14:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our conclusions are based on a relatively modest number of trials of which only four have been published in the last decade. More research is required to define the important characteristics of effective ESD services and to define the balance of cost and benefit for different patient and service groups. Contemporary trials would provide data on resource use and functional outcome in an era with greater access to revascularisation therapies. Further research is required to establish if more generic ESD teams (e.g. services for a mixed elderly population) or those which shift tasks to families or support workers will obtain the same results as the stroke-specific services reported here. The role of ESD services in poorer healthcare settings and in more dispersed rural communities has not really been adequately addressed.</P>

<P>For the 2012 update some post-hoc analyses were carried out. These are highlighted in the text. The 2012 update did not explicitly include or exclude cluster-randomised trial design and one was included (<LINK REF="STD-Glostrup-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glostrup 2006</LINK>). For the current update, we have clarified inclusion criteria to exclude cluster-randomised trials because of: 1) difficulties in obtaining data for appropriate analysis, and 2) increasing focus on cluster-randomised trial methodology for implementation rather than evaluation trials. This results in the loss of one trial of 198 participants with no change in the conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Glostrup-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glostrup 2006</LINK>). The title was revised in 2017 to 'Early supported discharge services for people with acute stroke' to better reflect the content of the review.</P>

<P>This pilot study was to determine the feasibility of a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial in India of a family-led, trained caregiver-delivered, home-based rehabilitation intervention vs routine care</P>
<P>Intervention: these patients had their family-nominated caregiver trained by a trial physiotherapist, using a structured assessment (cognition, language, function, and mobility) and recommended rehabilitation package. "The evidence-based intervention package included:</P>
<P>1. information on stroke recovery trajectory, risk, identification and management of low mood, and the importance of repeated practice of task-specific activities;</P>
<P>2. joint goal setting with patient, nominated family caregiver, and therapist (reviewed with the therapist as patient progresses and new goals set);</P>
<P>3. positioning, transfers, and mobility;</P>
<P>4. task-orientated training (particularly walking, upper-limb, and self-care tasks); and</P>
<P>5. discharge planning</P>
<P>The local team developed a culturally appropriate, simple, pictorial 'manual' covering key exercises relevant to ADL. In addition to the manual, training exercises were also chosen from the website http://www.physiotherapyexercises.com or as determined best for the patient by the therapist, all adhering to the intervention package".</P>
<P>The caregiver training advised commencing in the hospital for approximately 60 min per day for about 3 days (with the intention of accelerating the patient's hospital discharge when safe). The caregiver would then continue the intervention when the patient was discharged home. The trial therapist could be contacted through telephone for support and guidance over the next 3 months</P>

<P>The main goal of this study was to adapt an 'early home-supported discharge (EHSD)' service model to the conditions of Portugal, and then to evaluate the impact of this service</P>
<P>Intervention: the intervention started in the stroke unit. The team co-ordinator at the hospital identified potential patients for the study. After obtaining the informed consent, the patient would be randomised and the case manager contacted to schedule a visit to the patient. Community-based multidisciplinary team comprising physiotherapist, occupational therapist, gerontologist (case manager), and psychologist - all staff with previous experience in stroke care but no specialised training in stroke rehabilitation stroke care. Team co-ordinate and deliver care. Team are co-ordinated via weekly multidisciplinary meetings. The EHSD intervention started in the stroke unit, where the patient and informal caregiver were met by their assigned EHSD case manager. The assigned case manager was 1 of 2 gerontologists who were included to help negotiate the fragmented nature of the Portuguese health and social care systems. Input from the EHSD team of therapists (2 physiotherapists, 2 occupational therapists, and a psychologist) was selected according to the needs of a particular patient. For patients discharged to their homes, the intervention continued directly after discharge to provide a seamless transfer from the hospital to home (individual rehabilitation plan, provision of aids and modifications, providing information and tailored training to the patient and family). Rehabilitation was focused on daily activities valued by the patient. Caregivers were trained and made aware of the ability of the patient and were encouraged to follow their progress. The EHSD team worked with patients to provide approximately 8 home-based training sessions for a maximum of 1 month. For patients discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation setting, contact with the EHSD team was reinitiated when discharge home was planned. For those patients discharged home while waiting for a place in a rehabilitation unit, the team provided rehabilitation at home to prevent loss of rehabilitation capability</P>
<P>Control: patients in the usual care group were contacted in the stroke unit, introduced to the study, and assigned a case manager. They began their rehabilitation as part of standard care in the stroke unit and then accessed the standard rehabilitation available in the region following discharge They received information about services available in the community, but no further specific input was provided</P>

<P>The primary outcome of the study was independence in physical and cognitive activities as assessed by FIM at 2 and 6 months after randomisation. They proposed that a patient with 3 points in each variable (total score of less than 60) would require inpatient rehabilitation.This threshold value was used to further analyse the data. As it was not set a priori and there was no literature on which to base the decision, results were handled with care</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures included: the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI),the World Health Organization WHOQOLBREF quality of life assessment (WHOQOLBREF), Short Form-6D, BI, and MMSE. Outcome measures were collected at the patients homes by the case managers. Length of stay at the stroke unit and the convalescence units was obtained from the clinical records</P>

<P>Patients in 2 of the 3 study arms were treated according to the ESD concept. They were followed-up by a designated multi-disciplinary ambulatory team consisting of a nurse, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist from soon after admission to the stroke unit until shortly after discharge to home. This team originated from the rehabilitation department and served as a co-ordinating link between the patient, relatives, hospital personnel, and the personnel in primary health care. The team was particularly important in the discharge process and co-operated closely with the municipal health care in the planning and implementation of further treatment after discharge.<BR/>The two ESD arms differed by the location of treatment:<BR/>ESD 1 group received their treatment in a community day unit; whereas</P>
<P>ESD 2 group patients stayed in their homes with home visits from the community health team</P>
<P>Patients in the third study arm constituted a control group and were treated as usual without any intervention from the study, except outpatient appointments for testing. Treatment 'as usual' mainly comprised institutional stay if necessary and/or physiotherapy as needed in the municipality (0 to 2 hours per week). Patients in all 3 study arms received language therapy as needed, regardless of allocated arm</P>
<P>The patients in the two ESD arms were discharged to their homes as soon as possible. Patients in need of a longer in-patient treatment period than offered by the stroke unit were discharged to a municipal institution or rehabilitation department for a period before going home. All patients in the ESD arms were offered rehabilitative treatment by a multi-disciplinary community health team, consisting of a nurse, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist<BR/>The scheduled treatment period was 5 weeks and maximally 4 hours per day 5 days a week, but many patients did not comply with this</P>

<P>We have two questions relating to forest plot 1.3 (Death or dependency).</P>
<OL>
<LI>For the London study, we cannot work out how the results were derived from the paper by Rudd et al (BMJ 1997).We calculate from Table 3 of the Rudd paper that there are 116 and 125 poor outcomes in the community and conventional arms respectively (by adding the numbers of deaths to Barhel 0-14 + 15-19).There were 45 versus 35 good outcomes, and 6 versus 4 unknown outcomes. Whatever you do with the unknowns, we think the result should be more extremely in favour of the treatment than that reported.</LI>
<LI>For the Newcastle study, the values in the forest plot seem to be the good outcome, instead of the poor outcome, and the treated and control arms have been swapped.The resulting odds ratio is actually correct (as in this case, two wrongs do make a right) but the numbers of events should really be 18/46 and 24/46.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Neither of these things would change the conclusions of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>I have modified the conflict of interest statement to declare my interests: This issue was found as part of a methodological project funded by the UK MRC.</P>
