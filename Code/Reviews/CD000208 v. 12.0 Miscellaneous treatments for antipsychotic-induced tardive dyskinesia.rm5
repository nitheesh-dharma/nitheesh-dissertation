Tardive dyskinesia is a disfiguring and disabling disorder of abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements, and it is often caused by antipsychotic drugs. More than 20% of people who rely on antipsychotic drugs to control their mental illness have developed tardive dyskinesia. Many different interventions have been studied for easing the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Several Cochrane reviews have summarised the effects of the many treatments used to manage these involuntary movements. This review focusses on 'miscellaneous', a group of other non-connected, interventions not covered in the other Cochrane reviews on tardive dyskinesia.</P><P><B>What are the main results of the review?</B></P><P>We found 31 studies that reported on 24 different interventions to improve tardive dyskinesia in 1278 people who take antipsychotic medication for their chronic mental illnesses.

Five trials are awaiting classification and seven trials are ongoing. All participants were adults with chronic psychiatric disorders, mostly schizophrenia, and antipsychotic-induced TD. Studies were primarily of short (three to six6 weeks) duration with small samples size (10 to 157 participants), and most (61%) were published more than 20 years ago. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment, generation of the sequence, and blinding.</P><P>Nineteen of the 31 included studies reported on the primary outcome 'No clinically important improvement in TD symptoms'. Two studies found moderate-quality evidence of a benefit of the intervention compared with placebo: valbenazine (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86, 1 RCT, n = 92) and extract of <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96, 1 RCT, n = 157), respectively. However, due to small sample sizes we cannot be certain of these effects.</P><P>We consider the results for the remaining interventions to be inconclusive: Low- to very low-quality evidence of a benefit was found for buspirone (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, 1 RCT, n = 42), dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.97, 1 RCT, n = 28), hypnosis or relaxation, (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.94, 1 study, n = 15), pemoline (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.77, 1 RCT, n = 46), promethazine (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, 1 RCT, n = 34), insulin (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96, 1 RCT, n = 20), branched chain amino acids (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00, 1 RCT, n = 52), and isocarboxazid (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.71, 1 RCT, n = 20).

These drugs can effectively control symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). In addition, maintenance therapy with neuroleptics is associated with a reduced risk of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>).</P><P>Antipsychotic medication, however, has also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders. The appearance of these movement disorders can contribute to poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>), and hence relapse.</P><P>Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is one such movement disorder and is characterised by abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). The clinical features include tongue protrusion, side-to-side or rotatory movement of the jaw, lip smacking, puckering and pursing, and rapid eye blinking (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). In some people rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. TD is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which spontaneously fluctuates (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Studies on the natural history of TD have reported widely variable remission rates (1% to 62%) depending on patient age, psychiatric diagnosis, course of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>).</P><P>Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic medication, it is clinically striking that dose reduction can lead to a temporary exacerbation in symptoms. Conversely, increasing the dose is often associated with a temporary remission (<LINK REF="REF-Cavallaro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavallaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>). The exact mechanisms of the pathophysiology of TD are unknown. Antipsychotic drugs block certain chemical receptor sites in the brain - one of these is specific for dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). One hypothesis explaining the cause of antipsychotic-induced TD is that chronic blockade of dopamine receptors in specific cells of the brain (neurones from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Casey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casey 1994</LINK>). There is also a suggestion that the chronic use of antipsychotics may also cause an abnormal production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in turn, could be responsible for the appearance of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cadet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadet 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2000</LINK>).</P><P>TD occurs in more than 20% of those using antipsychotic medication continually for longer than three months (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarsy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarsy 2011</LINK>). Every year 4% to 5% of adults and 25% to 30% of elderly persons who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2004</LINK>). Advancing age is a risk factor for both TD's prevalence and severity, with those who are &lt; 60 years of age being three times more likely to spontaneously remit (<LINK REF="REF-Jeste-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeste 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1980</LINK>).</P><P>The prevalence of TD is often thought to be decreasing based on the use of atypical antipsychotics in place of typical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>). A systematic review found that the incidence of TD associated with atypical antipsychotics (2% to 4%) was significantly lower than that for typical antipsychotics (5% to 8%) (<LINK REF="REF-Correll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correll 2008</LINK>). Despite this, the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics in clinical settings, increased off-label use, and an ageing population may still result in an overall increase in the number of cases of TD (<LINK REF="REF-Cloud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloud 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2012</LINK>). The problem will be considerably greater for people in countries where use of newer drugs is less prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Ballesteros-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballesteros 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martins 2011</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Various types of interventions have been evaluated as potential treatments for TD. There is now a series of Cochrane reviews relevant to the care of people with TD (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).This review summarises any trial-based evidence for the effects of any other treatments that were not summarised in any of the other reviews evaluating interventions for TD. Please see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>,<I> 6. Interventions</I> for the 24 interventions included in this review.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-22 12:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Use of treatments such as botulin, endorphin, oestrogen, essential fatty acid, EX11582A, ganglioside, lithium, naloxone, periactin, phenylalanine, piracetam, stepholidine, and tryptophan is based on their possible beneficial effects in other movement disorders. Also, interventions using neurosurgery or electroconvulsive therapy have been used for managing the distressing signs and symptoms of TD. </P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-13 23:11:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Several atypical antipsychotic drugs have been produced in the last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does point to the fact that thoughtful use of older generation drugs is not associated with any more problems of TD than with newer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2008</LINK>). However, in a global context, it is likely that the less expensive and more familiar drugs - such as chlorpromazine or haloperidol - will continue to be the mainstay of treatment of people with schizophrenia (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf">WHO Essential List 2010</A>). Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and, therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.</P><P>TD can result in considerable social and physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>) and symptoms are often irreversible (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1990</LINK>). Additionally, TD is frequently associated with lower quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ascher_x002d_Svanum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher-Svanum 2008</LINK>) and a greater mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2009</LINK>). Given the high incidence and prevalence of TD among people taking antipsychotic medication, the need for prevention or treatment is clear. Unfortunately, there has been sparse evidence to guide clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2009</LINK>). Although many treatments have been tested, no one intervention has been shown clearly to be effective. Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication would be the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always possible, not least because in many individuals such a reduction would lead to relapse. This review focuses on whether the addition of different types of miscellaneous medications to those already receiving antipsychotic medication is likely to help TD. </P><P>This review is one in a series of nine Cochrane reviews (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) evaluating treatments for antipsychotic-induced TD, and is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2000</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>1.

Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING><P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to relevant data before inclusion.<BR/></P><P>Please note, we planned to enter data from studies of at least 200 participants in the analysis, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We entered all relevant change data as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not.</P><P>For endpoint data from studies &lt; 200 participants:</P><P>(a) when a scale starts from the &#64257;nite number zero, we subtracted the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher than one but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We entered these data and tested whether their inclusion or exclusion changed the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2 we included these data, because skew is less likely (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P><P>(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING><P>Where relevant, to facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING><P>Where possible, we converted continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this can be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>).

Cluster trials</HEADING><P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Had cluster trials been included and clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, if cluster-randomised trials are included, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients ICCs) for their clustered data and adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P><P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING><P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.

We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table/s by down-rating quality.

We assumed all those leaving the study early to have no improvement. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change by comparing data only from people who completed the study to that point to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">3.

If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either the P value or t value available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD=SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up</HEADING><P>Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We therefore did not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we prefered to use the more sophisticated approaches. (e.g. MMRM or multiple-imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some kind of ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></MISSING_DATA><HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">1.

The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.

Few data</HEADING><P>Overall, data from 1278 people were included in this review, but few participants were included for each intervention. The number of participants per comparison ranged from 10 (experimental compound ritanserin) to 157 (Chinese herb <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>). It is possible that real, and important, effects have not been highlighted because of the necessarily wide confidence intervals of the findings. Many outcomes were not measured at all (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), including one of our pre-stated outcome measures. We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of these outcomes in tardive dyskinesia (TD) trials but simple reporting of satisfaction with care or quality of life still does not seem too demanding and does remain of interest.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3.

Applicability</HEADING><P>Trials were a mixture of hospital-based and outpatient, and were on people who would be recognisable in everyday care, however, mostly on men in their 50s with schizophrenia in hospital and mostly in high-income countries. Overall, sample sizes in relevant studies were particularly small. In light of the lack of power available to examine the compounds of interest, the results should be interpreted as inconclusive rather than negative at this stage. The majority of studies had a duration of six weeks or less whilst only seven had a duration of at least 12 weeks. Whether the effects of the interventions were maintained at longer periods of follow-up may therefore be under-reported in short-term studies.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, the quality of the evidence is low to very low.

Authors of eight studies did not reply, and we could not find up-to-date contact details for authors of two studies (both over 30 years old).

We welcome comments or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all or had to report data in a different way. We believe the 'Summary of findings' tables are a valuable innovation &#8211; but problematic to those not &#8216;blind&#8217; to the outcome data.

The previous version of this review contained assessments of eight interventions (ceruletide, gammalinolenic acid, insulin, lithium, oestrogen, phenylalanine, piracetam, and ethyl-EPA) and the conclusions on those interventions has not changed with this update. In addition, we have updated this review with evidence from another 16 interventions. <LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2017</LINK> reports on interventions in all nine Cochrane reviews on TD in this series (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and is in agreement with the findings and conclusions of this review.</P><P>Other systematic reviews have covered melatonin (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>), extract of <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2016</LINK>), and any treatment for TD (<LINK REF="REF-Alimi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alimi 2013</LINK>). We are in agreement with both <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>, that "There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of melatonin in patients with TD", and with <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2016</LINK>, that <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> appears to be safe and effective for improving TD symptoms and that better randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this evidence.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Alimi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alimi 2013</LINK> found that three of the interventions included in this review may help to improve TD symptoms: BCAAs, <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>, and piracetam. Our review included the same studies for these three interventions and also found that BCAAs and <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> appear to reduce TD symptoms. However, for BCAAs, we also conclude that due to the small sample size (n = 68), short follow-up (three weeks), and risk of bias, we are very uncertain about this result, and for <I>Ginkgo biloba</I>, we also conclude that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate because evidence was of moderate quality (due to small sample size, n = 157). <LINK REF="STD-Libov-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Libov 2007</LINK>, the study that evaluated piracetam, is a cross-over study and we extracted data only from the first phase because of risk of carry-over effect despite a wash-out period and because TD is an unstable condition (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>, <I>2.1 Use of cross-over design</I>). This may be why our results differed from <LINK REF="REF-Alimi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alimi 2013</LINK> on piracetam; we found no benefit.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia (TD)</HEADING><P>Most of this group of miscellaneous treatments do not look even promising for helping symptoms of TD. There is, however, some suggestion that valbenazine and extract of <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> may alter the course of TD for those with schizophrenia. The findings on <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> are in keeping with other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Alimi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alimi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2016</LINK>), and valbenazine has been approved by the FDA for use in TD (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2017</LINK>). To date, these data are still weak and should be interpreted with caution. If offered any of these treatments to offset symptoms of TD a person taking antipsychotic medication would be justified in asking for evidence, and encouraging generation of new, better evidence by volunteering to help with a well-designed evaluative study.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING><P>Most of this miscellaneous group of treatments remain purely experimental and there is no place for their use in every day practice. This review generates a theory that valbenazine and extract of <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> could reduce TD symptoms to a clinically important degree. The data in this review do not justify routine use of these treatments, however, valbenazine is the only treatment included in this review that has been approved by the FDA for use in TD (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2017</LINK>). It would be reasonable, however, to ask people with schizophrenia to complicate their treatment plan if the use of this group of miscellaneous treatments were to generate data better than seen in this review. There is a real place for clinician-driven research, with prescription within the context of a randomised trial and routine data collection on outcomes of relevance to people with TD and their clinicians.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For policy makers and managers</HEADING><P>This is the largest in the series of Cochrane reviews on TD. We found inconclusive (low- to very low-certainty evidence) evidence on most of the interventions, however, there was moderate-certainty evidence that adding valbenazine or extract of <I>Ginkgo biloba</I> to treatment with antipsychotic medication probably helps with the symptoms of TD. Valbenazine is the only treatment included in this review that has been approved by the FDA for use in TD (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2017</LINK>). More well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. This unattractive adverse effect is caused, to a greater or lesser extent, by antipsychotic drugs. Clinicians and researchers should feel responsible enough to continue to try to help it. Those compiling guidance could encourage supportive activity and more research into this neglected area.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING><P>The power of this review would have been greatly enhanced by better reporting of data. For example, only five studies (16%) made explicit how randomisation was undertaken, and only seven (23%) described allocation concealment. Many of the studies we found were performed decades ago, before CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). This is intended to improve reporting of randomised controlled trials, enabling readers to understand the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of results. CONSORT emphasises that this can only be achieved through complete transparency from authors. It is only too easy to judge studies of the past by standards of today, future studies, however, should report to a much higher standard.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING><P>The number of disparate compounds targeted in this review is indicative of the frustration felt by researchers. Still, after decades of research, no clearly effective treatments for TD have emerged. Presumably an even greater variety of interventions never even reached the stage of warranting examination in a randomised controlled trial. As basic science increases our understanding of the neurobiological basis of involuntary movements, psychiatric researchers should remain vigilant for new candidate compounds for the treatment of TD. TD remains a large problem and worthy of research, even with use of lower doses and newer compounds. Well-designed randomised controlled trials, involving a large number of participants over protracted periods of time, are needed if we are to see if an intervention could have a role in prevention and treatment of TD. Such studies are of importance to people with the problem (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and have long been ignored.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Use of cross-over design</HEADING><P>Trialists find it difficult to identify people with both TD and schizophrenia to participate in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1991</LINK>). Randomised cross-over design is used in the hope of improving the power of the study to find outcomes of interest. This design initially asks participants to be randomised to one of the experimental interventions, and then, at a pre-specified time, to be crossed over to the treatment that they did not at first receive. Conditions with a more stable time course than TD are better suited for cross-over studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>). Further difficulties are the carry-over effect. Unless cross-over studies include a mid-study washout period (where the person is free of treatment before starting the next arm of the study), any effect of an intervention may continue into the second half placebo arm of the trial &#8211; the 'carry-over effect'. Also, carry-over may involve the re-growth or retreat of neuroreceptors. This slow re-balancing, if started, could continue long after all traces of the intervention are gone, so physiological half-life of the experimental treatment may not be the only variable to consider when thinking though the issues of carry-over. TD is also an unstable condition and people with TD may not remain compliant with medication. All these factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology strong, despite the initial attraction (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1983</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Sample size calculation</HEADING><P>The results suggest that larger sample size should be used to provide more precise estimates of effect and to help avoid false conclusions about the effects of the proposed treatment.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Length of study</HEADING><P>One study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bucci-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Bucci 1971</LINK>) used the intervention for more than three months. TD, however, is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of which fluctuates spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1992</LINK>). Even if an intervention has a swift effect, it is the long-term outcomes that must be considered of most clinical value.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Outcomes</HEADING><P>Scale-derived data do have their place. Trials most commonly used the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scale. This is a very widely used tool to measure the severity of symptoms of those who have TD. The use of this scale to measure change as a result of treatment is, however, problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Bergen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergen 1984</LINK>). It is therefore important that a scale is validated for measuring changes secondary to treatment in those with TD. In addition, many of the outcomes we initially desired when we started this review have not been investigated. Finally, a service user consultation also informed the addition of outcomes of special importance to patients. We have reconsidered all these outcomes in case they were too ambitious and tried to tailor them to a real-world pragmatic trial design (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 12:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors are indebted to Geoff Davies, Kirsten Mason, Carmel Meir and Leanne Roberts for assistance with this review.</P><P>We are especially grateful to the following trialists who provided additional material; Professor Jes Gerlach, Dr Tetsuo Matsunaga, Dr Jacques Mouret, Dr Jan Sikora, Dr Krishna Viddadi and Dr Adam Wolkin.

Again, where disagreement occurred attempts were made to resolve this through discussion; if doubt still remained we added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING><P>1. Extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data. Where disagreement occurred attempts were made to resolve this by discussion, where doubt still remained we sought further information from the study authors to resolve the dilemma, and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P><P>2. Management<BR/>2.1 Data storage<BR/>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms. Where possible, data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicates a 'favourable' outcome for the treatment group. Where this was not possible, (e.g. scales that calculate higher scores=improvement) the graphs in RevMan analyses were labelled accordingly so that the direction of effects were clear.</P><P>2.2 Categorical or continuous into binary<BR/>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to binary data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into "clinically improved" or "not clinically improved". It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>, this could be considered a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=71843985040007743851111005164840&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Leucht-2005">Leucht 2005</A>). It is recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data are available, we used the 50% cut-off point for non-chronically ill people and a 25% cut-off point for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P><P>2.3 Continuous data and their distribution<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in mental health trials are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to all endpoint data derived from continuous measures. The criteria were used before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means had to be obtainable; and, for finite scores, such as endpoint measures on rating scales, (b) the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by 2 had to be less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P><P>Skewed endpoint data from studies with less the 200 participants were not shown graphically, but were added to 'Other data' tables and briefly commented on in the text. However, skewed endpoint data from larger studies (=/&gt;200 participants) pose less of a problem and we entered the data for analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P><P>For continuous mean change data (endpoint minus baseline) the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if change data are skewed. The RevMan meta-analyses of continuous data are based on the assumption that the data are, at least to a reasonable degree, normally distributed. We included such data, unless endpoint data were also reported from the same scale.</P><P>2.4 Final endpoint value versus change data<BR/>Where both final endpoint data and change data were available for the same outcome category, only final endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data may be excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence.</P><P>3. Scale-derived data<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure outcomes in mental health studies. These instruments vary in quality and many are not validated, or are even ad hoc. It is accepted generally that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure) (<LINK REF="REF-Rust-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 1989</LINK>). Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, the following minimum standards for instruments were set: the instrument should either be (a) a self-report or (b) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist) and (c) the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING><P>We assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P><P>The categories are defined below:</P><P>YES - low risk of bias<BR/>NO - high risk of bias<BR/>UNCLEAR - uncertain risk of bias</P><P>If disputes arose as to which category a trial has to be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion, after working with a third reviewer.</P><P>Earlier versions of this review used a different means of categorising risk of bias (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING><P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the fixed effects model. Relative Risk is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number- needed- to- harm (NNH). Where people were lost to follow up at the end of the study, we assumed that they had had a poor outcome and once they were randomised they were included in the analysis (intention-to-treat /ITT analysis).</P><P>2. Continuous data<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups based on a fixed effects model.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING><P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Where clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P><P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported we assumed it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P><P>2. Cross-over design<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia,¬we will only use¬data¬of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P><P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING><P>1. Overall loss of credibility<BR/>At some degree of loss to follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2007</LINK>). We are forced to make a judgment where this is for the trials likely to be included in this review. Should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for by 8 weeks we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.</P><P>2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'), as such data were felt to be too prone to bias. In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented them separately.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING><P>1. Clinical heterogeneity<BR/>We preempted heterogeneity by keeping different treatment groups separate but also tried to think if there were such obvious clinical differences in studies that synthesis be inadvisable.</P><P>2. Statistical<BR/>2.1 Visual inspection<BR/>We visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity.</P><P>2.2 Employing the I-squared statistic<BR/>This provided an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. I-squared estimate greater than or equal to 50% was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING><P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. These are described in section 10.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. Should funnel plots have been possible, we would have sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING><P>Where possible we used a fixed effects model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random effects models. The random effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random effects does put added weight onto the smaller studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING><P>When heterogeneous results were found, we investigated the reasons for this. Where heterogeneous data substantially altered the results and the reasons for the heterogeneity were identified, these studies were not summated in the meta-analysis, but presented separately and discussed in the text.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING><P>Apart from the investigation of heterogeneity, the effect of including studies with high attrition rates were analysed in sensitivity analyses.</P></SUBSECTION></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-03" MODIFIED="2017-11-16 17:07:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="3"><TITLE MODIFIED="2009-09-02 15:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Assessment of quality</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-11-16 17:07:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>) by each reviewer working independently.
