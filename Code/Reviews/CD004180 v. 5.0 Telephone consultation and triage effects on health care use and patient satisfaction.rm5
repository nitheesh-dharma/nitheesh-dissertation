<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Visits to emergency departments and family doctors have increased. One possible way to decrease the demands is to provide telephone helplines, hotlines or consultations. People can speak with health care professionals, such as doctors and nurses, on the telephone and receive medical advice or a referral to an appropriate health service. Nine studies were found and analysed to determine whether telephone consultation was safe and effective. In general, at least half of the calls were handled by telephone only (without the need for face-to-face visits). It was found that telephone consultation appears to decrease the number of immediate visits to doctors and does not appear to increase visits to emergency departments. It is still unclear though, whether it is just delaying visits to a later time. Telephone consultation also appears to be safe and people were just as satisfied using the telephone as going to see someone face-to-face. There are still questions about its effectiveness and more research into the use, cost, safety and satisfaction of telephone consultation is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Telephone consultation is the process where calls are received, assessed and managed by giving advice or by referral to a more appropriate service. In recent years there has been a growth in telephone consultation developed, in part, as a response to increased demand for general practitioner (GP) and accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department care.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of telephone consultation on safety, service usage and patient satisfaction and to compare telephone consultation by different health care professionals.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the specialised register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE, and the National Research Register. We checked reference lists of identified studies and review articles and contacted experts in the field. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The searches were updated in 2007 and no new studies were found.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled studies, controlled before/after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITSs) of telephone consultation or triage in a general health care setting. Disease specific phone lines were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data and assessed study quality. Data were collected on adverse events, service usage, cost and patient satisfaction. Due to heterogeneity we did not pool studies in a meta-analysis and instead present a narrative summary of the findings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, five RCTs, one CCT and three ITSs. Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by a clinic clerk. Three studies compared telephone consultation by different types of health care workers; two compared nurses with doctors and one compared health assistants with doctors or nurses. Three of five studies found a decrease in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations. In general at least 50% of calls were handled by telephone advice alone. Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits, six showed no difference between the groups and one, of nurse telephone consultation, found an increase in visits. Two studies reported deaths and found no difference between nurse telephone triage and normal care. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners. However, questions remain about its affect on service use and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In recent years there has been an increase in the use of telephone consultation and triage; the process where calls, from people with a health care problem, are received, assessed and managed by giving advice or by referral to a more appropriate service (<LINK REF="REF-Lattimer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lattimer 1996</LINK>). This growth has been international and includes systems in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2002</LINK>), Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>), New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-St-George-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">St George 2001</LINK>), Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Marklund-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marklund 1989</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Lafrance-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lafrance 2002</LINK>), the United States (USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 2000</LINK>), and the United Kingdom (GBR) (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1997</LINK>). These systems, in general, aim either to help with the provision of out of hours care, manage demand for care, or provide an additional source of help and advice that is not limited to out of hours care alone. </P>
<P>One impetus for the development of telephone consultation is to reduce the burden on general practitioners (GPs) and accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments. A&amp;E attendances in the UK have increased (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Commission" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Commission</LINK>), as has demand for the service of general practitioners (GPs), although it has been estimated that more than half of out of hours calls can be handled by telephone advice alone (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dale-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 1987</LINK>). To date relatively little information exists on whether telephone consultation reduces pressure on other services. In Denmark demand for home visits fell by 28% after the introduction of telephone consultation by doctors (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>). In the UK there was a small decrease in GP out of hours contacts, though no significant decrease in the use of A&amp;E departments or ambulance services after the introduction of National Health Service (NHS) Direct (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2000b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although some telephone consultation is done by doctors (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>), much is now done by qualified nurses using computer based clinical decision support systems. This reflects changes in the role of the nurse in recent years and the move towards nurses undertaking some tasks previously done by doctors. One of the largest telephone consultation systems in operation is NHS Direct in the UK. This is a 24 hour nurse-led telephone advice system, based in England, which aims to help callers self-manage problems and reduce unnecessary demands on other NHS services (<LINK REF="REF-Calman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Caller satisfaction with NHS Direct has been found to be high (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Cathain-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Cathain 2000</LINK>). However, it has been argued that older people, ethnic minorities, and other disadvantaged groups under use the service, and that it has not decreased, and may in fact have increased, the burden on other health care services (<LINK REF="REF-George-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2002</LINK>). Other concerns about telephone consultation include the quality and safety of advice given (<LINK REF="REF-Verdie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salk 1998</LINK>); although, more recent research has found it safe and effective (<LINK REF="STD-SWOOP-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SWOOP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poole-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1993</LINK>). In an attempt to clarify the situation we conducted a systematic review of telephone consultation and triage services to assess their effect on safety, satisfaction and service usage. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess the effects of all telephone consultation and triage services on safety, service usage, and patient satisfaction in comparison with no telephone consultation.<BR/>2. To compare effects on caller safety, service usage, and patient satisfaction of telephone consultation led by different groups of health care workers (e.g. nurse-led versus doctor-led telephone consultation.<BR/>3. To compare effects on caller safety, service usage, and patient satisfaction, of nurse telephone consultation with and without computer assisted algorithms.<BR/>4. To compare effects, on caller safety, service usage, and patient satisfaction, of telephone consultation with follow on care versus telephone consultation where no face-to-face service is offered (e.g. doctors surgery versus an advice line such as NHS Direct).</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before/after Studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITSs). For definitions see the Glossary on the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) module (See EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for GLOSSARY).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Populations and areas with potential access to telephone consultation lines.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All designated telephone consultation systems where patients calls are received, assessed and managed by giving advice or by referral to a more appropriate service. This included those with and without computer based clinical decision support systems. Although initially we felt there might be a distinction between telephone consultation and telephone triage services we found that the terms were used interchangeably. Therefore, throughout the review, the term 'telephone consultation' will be used to encompass both consultation and triage.</P>
<P>The comparisons of interest were:<BR/>Telephone consultation (by any health care professional) followed by face-to-face consultation if appropriate versus normal care (e.g. face-to- face contact alone).<BR/>Telephone consultation where no face-to-face service is offered (e.g. NHS Direct) versus normal care (e.g. face-to-face contact alone).<BR/>Telephone consultation by one health care professional group versus telephone consultation by another professional group or health care worker (e.g. nurse-led telephone consultation versus doctor-led telephone consultation).</P>
<P>We excluded the following interventions:<BR/>Telephone consultations not done as part of a designated telephone consultation system (e.g. telephone advice given as part of GPs usual work).<BR/>Phone lines aimed at one specific illness (e.g. diabetes), or only at self help or support (e.g. smoking cessation, weight control). Disease specific phone lines are excluded because they are likely to be information giving services rather than focusing on consultation. In addition it would make the review too diverse and it would be difficult to pre-specify all the disease specific outcomes of importance.<BR/>Telephone consultation not given directly to the patient or carer.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Visits to A&amp;E departments and GPs' surgeries.<BR/>Home visits by GPs/deputising services within normal hours. <BR/>Out-of-hours contacts.<BR/>Number of calls handled by telephone advice alone (e.g. no referral to other health care professional/ face to face contact).<BR/>Unplanned hospital admissions.<BR/>Mortality rates.<BR/>Adverse events.<BR/>Patient and carer satisfaction.<BR/>Patient quality of life.<BR/>Health care professionals attitudes/satisfaction.<BR/>Cost to health care system and cost to patient.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched for published and unpublished studies using the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2003), EPOC specialised register (March 2003), PubMed (1966-February 2003), EMBASE (February 2003), CINAHL (1983-February 2003), SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature) (1980-February 2003), and the National Research Register (a database of ongoing and recently completed research projects funded by the UK National Health Service) (Issue 2 2003). Initially we ran the search including methodological search terms but this strategy appeared to miss studies. We, therefore, re-ran an adapted version of the search without methodological terms and combined the results from the two searches. The search terms used can be seen below. We also checked reference lists of identified studies and review articles, and contacted experts in the field. There were no language restrictions. The searches were updated in July 2007 but no new studies were found.</P>
<P>The MEDLINE strategy for the update is detailed below. The other updated searches and the searches from the first version of this review are available in the Additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>
</I>
<B>Trial identification<BR/>
</B>Two review authors independently examined the title and abstract of citations identified by the electronic search and reports of possibly relevant trials identified by either were retrieved in full. Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria and extracted data, resolving disagreements by discussion. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist (see EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for METHODS USED IN REVIEWS). We compared quality assessments and resolved differences by discussion. For randomised controlled trials we collected information on allocation concealment, loss to follow up, blinding of outcome assessment, baseline measurement and reliability of primary outcome measure. For non-randomised studies we collected information on whether outcome assessment was blinded, the completeness of the data set and the reliability of the primary outcome measures. For ITSs we also assessed whether there were sufficient data collection points, if the intervention was independent of other changes, if a formal test for trend using appropriate method was reported and if the intervention was likely to affect data collection. Studies were not given overall scores as the use of summary scores from quality scales is not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>). <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Data extraction</I>
</B>
<BR/>Two review authors independently extracted information on the following: methodological quality of studies, unit of allocation and analysis, number of patients, type of participants, outcomes, intervention and length of follow up. Data extracted on the intervention included the comparison, setting, training of staff, description of staffing of the service, whether algorithms or computer based clinical decision support systems were used, and hours the service covered. </P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>Due to heterogeneity in study design, interventions, outcomes and participating health professionals we did not pool studies in a meta-analysis. Instead a narrative and tabular summary of findings is presented and, where possible, an assessment made on the quality, size of the effect observed and statistical significance of the studies. Studies are grouped in tables according to the outcome. For each study where possible we have reported the main results in natural units in the results table and post-intervention differences and 95% confidence intervals or P values. For interrupted time series where possible we have calculated a change in the level of outcome at the first point after the introduction of the intervention, and estimated a change in the slopes of the regression line (calculated as post-intervention minus pre-intervention slope).</P>

<P>We found nine studies, five RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>), one CCT, where patients were allocated to groups in alternate weeks, (<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>) and three ITSs (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>), one of which (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) was a population based study. Two of the RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) were parallel trials using the same methodology. Six studies compared telephone consultation with standard management that did not include telephone consultation. Of those four evaluated telephone consultation by a doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>), one by a nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>), and one by a clinic clerk (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>). In one of those studies (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>) use of the system was very low with only 8% of eligible patients using the telephone line. Three studies compared telephone consultation by one type of health care worker with another. Two RCTs compared nurse telephone consultation with telephone consultation by a doctor in an out-of-hours deputising service (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) and one CCT compared telephone consultation by a health assistant with telephone advice from a doctor or a nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>). </P>

In all the studies using a nurse or other health care worker to deliver telephone consultation algorithms or protocols were used. The two earliest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>) looked at the use of other health care workers but more recent studies have concentrated on doctors or nurses delivering telephone consultations. Five studies were done in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>), three in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>) and one in Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies varied in size. Of the RCTs and CCT the largest (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>) included a GP co-operative of 55 GPs and dealt with a total of 14,492 calls. The number of calls in the others was 667 (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>), 561 (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>), 388 (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>), 338 (<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>) and 223 (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>). Of the ITSs the largest (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) covered a time period of nine years and a population of 630,000, and the smaller trials covered 12 months with a study population of 7200 (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>), and nine months with a study population of 20,800 (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>).</P>

</I>Follow up<BR/>Four studies report adequate follow up of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) but in the other two (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>) it was unclear. </P>
<P>Assessment of primary outcome blinded<BR/>All six trials were judged to have blinded assessment of the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) because the primary outcome measure was objective.</P>
<P>Baseline measurement<BR/>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>) reported that a baseline measurement of the outcome had been done. </P>
<P>Primary outcome measure reliable<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) used a reliable outcome measure for the primary outcome (e.g. data obtained from automated system), in the rest it was unclear.</P>
<P>Protection against contamination<BR/>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>) it was unlikely that communication between the control and intervention groups could occur. We, therefore, judged that it was protected against contamination. However, in the other five there was the possibility of contamination as the control group could receive the intervention (and in many cases be randomised twice).<BR/>

</B>Unit of allocation and analysis<BR/>In one study there was a unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>). The unit of allocation was practice teams and unit of analysis was individual patients. Therefore, as confidence intervals are likely to be too narrow and P-values too small, we have reported the effect size but no measure of statistical significance.</P>
<P>Power calculation<BR/>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) had done power calculations.

<BR/>Intervention independent of other changes<BR/>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) the author confirmed that there were no other changes in practice and policy that might have affected the handling of appointments. In the other (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) the intervention was judged to be independent of other changes.</P>
<P>Data analysed appropriately<BR/>In two of the studies the data were analysed appropriately. One (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) used autoregression analysis to allow for serial correlation and linear regression and one (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) used a multivariate time series analysis. However, in the third (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) they did not look for serial correlation and the analysis was redone using time series regression techniques.</P>
<P>Reason for number of point pre and post intervention given<BR/>None of the studies gave the reason for the number of time points chosen.</P>
<P>Was the shape of the intervention specified<BR/>In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) was the shape of the intervention specified.</P>
<P>Protection against detection bias<BR/>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) we judged that the intervention was unlikely to affect data collection but in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) there was a change from manual to electronic recording after the start of the intervention. </P>
<P>Blinded assessment of primary outcome(s)<BR/>In all three studies the primary outcome variable was objective and so assessment was judged to be blinded. </P>
<P>Completeness of data set<BR/>All three studies were judged to have complete data sets.</P>
<P>Reliable primary outcome measure(s)<BR/>Two studies used reliable primary outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>). In one (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) two researchers independently collected data and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) data collected by an individual were checked against electronic data.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We screened 3437 records from the electronic database searches of which 62 were considered to be potentially relevant based on the title or abstract. After full text review, eleven studies were judged to meet the inclusion criteria. However, two (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2002</LINK>) did not present relevant data and were excluded leaving nine studies. When interpreting the data, it should be noted that for many of the outcomes equivalence was regarded as desirable. Researchers were normally concerned to determine whether telephone consultation was as safe and effective as existing services. Numerical data are presented in 'other data' tables. </P>
<P>
<B>1. Telephone consultation versus normal care</B> (01 other data tables)<BR/>Six studies compared telephone consultation with standard management that did not include telephone consultation. Four evaluated telephone consultation by a doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>), one by a nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>), and one by a clinic clerk (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>).

<I>Routine general practitioner appointments</I>
</B> <BR/>Three studies reported the number of appointments at GP surgeries. The RCT, of telephone consultation by a doctor (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) found that although same-day appointments were decreased there was an increase in GP visits in the two week follow-up period (mean difference of 0.2 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.3) P= 0.01). In the ITS of nurse telephone triage (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) there was also a significant reduction in immediate GP appointments (RD -0.23 (95% CI -0.26 to -0.20)) but a subsequent increase in the number of return consultations (mean difference 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.41)(P= &lt;0.001)). The other ITS of telephone consultation by a doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) found a significant reduction of 39% in GP visits (P= &lt;0.001). <BR/>

<BR/>Three studies reported the number of calls managed by telephone consultation alone. In the RCT (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) doctors handled 72.2% of the calls by telephone advice alone. Of the ITSs, in one (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) nurses handled 25.5% of calls by telephone advice and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) doctors dealt with 29.3% of calls by telephone advice alone and a further 22.4% of patients were offered a prescription without a face-to-face consultation.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Visits to A&amp;E</I>
</B>
<BR/>Four studies looked at the number of visits to A&amp;E departments. In the three studies of telephone consultation by a doctor two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) found no significant difference between telephone consultation and face to face appointments (range difference -0.04 - 0). The other study, an ITS, (<LINK REF="STD-Vedsted-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vedsted 2001</LINK>) found a significant increase in contact rates with A&amp;E but, given the constant rise in contact rates, the authors performed a regression model which showed the increase was not statistically significant. The other ITS, of nurse telephone consultation, (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) found a significant rise in number of visits to A&amp;E, with a mean difference of 0.023 (95% CI 0.015 to 0.032) P = 0.001.</P>

The trial of telephone consultation by doctors (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>) found no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (adjusted risk difference at two year follow up = 0.03). However, the trial using clinic clerks to run a specialised telephone service (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>) found a significant reduction, in the intervention group, in hospitalisations at 12 months (mean difference = 0.17 P &lt;0.05).</P>

<I>Patient satisfaction</I>

<BR/>Four studies reported patient satisfaction. Of the three RCTs one (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) found no significant difference in levels of satisfaction between telephone and face to face consultations and over half of both groups said they would use telephone consultation in the future (difference -8.4% (95% CI -23.1% to 6.4%)). In the other two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>) patients in the intervention group were more satisfied. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>) 78% of those interviewed were satisfied with length of time before the doctor responded, length of consultation and care provided. In the other (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>) they used two satisfaction with care scales and found patients in the intervention group were more satisfied. This was significant at the overall multivariate level. In the ITS (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) 98% were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of the telephone consultation and 84% said they would be happy to receive the service again in the future. However, the satisfaction data needs to be interpreted cautiously. In one (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>) there was a response rate of less than 50%, in another (<LINK REF="STD-Darnell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Darnell 1985</LINK>) they only collected satisfaction data on a subset of 241 patients in the intervention group and in the ITS (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>) there is no comparison group.</P>

<I>Cost</I>
</B>
<BR/>Two ITSs reported data on cost. One (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>), which did a thorough economic evaluation, found little difference in cost between the intervention and control groups (mean difference 1.48 (95% CI - 0.19 to 3.15). In the other (<LINK REF="STD-Jiwa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jiwa 2002</LINK>), where they only looked at cost of the phone calls, they found that telephone bills increased by 26%.</P>

<P>
<B>3. Nurse telephone consultation with and without computer assisted algorithms</B>
<BR/>In all of the studies where telephone consultation was performed by a health care worker other than a doctor protocols or algorithms were used. Therefore, as there were no head to head comparisons with and without algorithms, we are unable to assess their effect. In addition, it would appear that the use of computer assisted algorithms for nurse telephone consultation is well established and further trials in this area are unlikely.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review found that telephone consultation and triage reduce immediate GP, or home, visits and that, in general, at least 50% of calls can be handled by telephone advice alone (ranging from 25.5% to 72.2%). However, it is unclear if in some instances triage is just delaying visits as two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McKinstry-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKinstry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>) showed an increase in return consultations. We found no evidence of an increase in adverse effects or use of other services and patients were satisfied. However, variability in interventions studied, methodological quality, and lack of power in some studies, means that results should be interpreted cautiously. In addition data on some of the outcomes, in particular patient satisfaction, cost and adverse events, were reported by few of the included studies. Initially we felt there would be a distinction between telephone consultation and triage systems. However, in reality, we found that these terms were used interchangeably. The majority of studies in this review, five out of nine were set in UK General Practice. </P>
<P>One of the aims of this review was to compare telephone consultation by different groups of health care professionals. Only three of the included studies directly compared one group of health care worker with another (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>). However, the two studies comparing nurse telephone consultation with a GP deputising service (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) were good quality RCTs and found nurses could reduce GP workload without an increase in adverse events. Two of the older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stirewalt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stirewalt 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strasser-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Strasser 1979</LINK>) use unqualified staff to deliver telephone consultation and are, therefore, perhaps less relevant to present day systems where the emphasis seems to be on consultation by qualified staff. In the other included studies the type of health care professional delivering the intervention did not appear to affect outcome although one study, of nurse telephone consultation, found a small but significant increase in out-of-hours contacts and visits to A&amp;E (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2002</LINK>). In all the studies of nurse telephone consultation computer algorithms were used. We were, therefore, unable to assess the effect of telephone consultation with and without computer assisted algorithms. Also although other uncontrolled studies have found high levels of satisfaction with nurse telephone consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Cathain-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Cathain 2000</LINK>), we have no way of assessing this important outcome as none of the studies of nurse telephone consultation in this review reported it adequately. </P>
<P>This review supports previous estimates that at least 50% of calls can be handled by telephone advice alone (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dale-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 1987</LINK>). In addition findings from an observational study, of the impact of NHS Direct, (<LINK REF="STD-Munro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 2000</LINK>) found that there was no decrease in the use of A&amp;E departments but an impact on the use of GP co-operatives, are similar to the results of this review. Although other studies have highlighted the potential for errors or mismanagement with telephone consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Verdie-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salk 1998</LINK>) few studies in this review reported adverse outcomes. However, the two that did (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1999</LINK>) found no increase in adverse events; although they were underpowered to detect mortality.</P>
<P>There are a number of methodological issues that could have an important bearing on the validity of these results. Publication and other selection biases are a potential threat to validity in all systematic reviews, but this is a particular problem when searching for non randomised studies. Non randomised studies are more difficult to identify than randomised ones because there is a variety of study designs, there is no standardised terminology and they may not be keyworded according to study design (<LINK REF="REF-Peersman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peersman 1998</LINK>). Despite our efforts to identify all eligible studies, published and unpublished, we cannot exclude the possibility that some studies were missed. In addition no studies met all the methodological criteria on the EPOC checklist which may also adversely affect the validity of the results.</P>
<P>The increase in the use of telephone consultation is, at least partially, a response to increased workloads for GPs and attempts to manage requests for same day appointments. In addition the current UK government agenda is promoting the use of alternative technologies to improve access to health care (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>). The largest telephone consultation service within the UK is now NHS Direct which is presently staffed by qualified nurses. However, we found no controlled studies of this service that met our inclusion criteria. Therefore, although telephone consultation appears to have the potential to reduce GP workload, further rigorous evaluation of such systems is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Telephone consultation can reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners and appears to be safe. However, there may be an increase in repeat visits and further evaluation is needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although we found nine evaluations of telephone consultation, that met our inclusion criteria, there was limited data on a number of important outcomes. Therefore, further rigorous evaluation of such systems is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF/>
<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>The term telephone consultation is used in the review in preference to telephone triage as it indicates that call management options include providing information and advice and do not just include referral on to another health care professional.</P>
