<P>People with autism spectrum disorders have difficulties with communication, behaviour and social interaction, and many also experience abnormal responses to sounds. The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of auditory integration therapy and therapies like it that have been developed to improve abnormal sound sensitivity and autistic behaviours in such individuals. Seven relatively small studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. These often measured different outcomes and reported mixed results. Benefits for participants receiving auditory integration therapy were only reported in two studies, involving 35 participants, for two outcomes. A study of Tomatis therapy did not measure behavioural outcomes and did not find any difference in language development between intervention and control groups. As such, there is no evidence to support the use of auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies at this time.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-11-02 13:08:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched the following databases in September 2010: CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to September week 2, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to Week 38, 2010), CINAHL (1937 to current), PsycINFO (1887 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), LILACS (September 2010) and the reference lists of published papers. One new study was found for inclusion.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-11-09 12:50:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials involving adults or children with autism spectrum disorders. Treatment was auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies involving listening to music modified by filtering and modulation. Control groups could involve no treatment, a waiting list, usual therapy or a placebo equivalent. The outcomes were changes in core and associated features of autism spectrum disorders, auditory processing, quality of life and adverse events.</P>

<P>Two independent review authors performed data extraction. All outcome data in the included papers were continuous. We calculated point estimates and standard errors from t-test scores and post-intervention means. Meta-analysis was inappropriate for the available data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 12:50:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified six randomised comtrolled trials of auditory integration therapy and one of Tomatis therapy, involving a total of 182 individuals aged three to 39 years. Two were cross-over trials. Five trials had fewer than 20 participants. Allocation concealment was inadequate for all studies. Twenty different outcome measures were used and only two outcomes were used by three or more studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to very high heterogeneity or the presentation of data in unusable forms. Three studies (Bettison 1996; Zollweg 1997; Mudford 2000) did not demonstrate any benefit of auditory integration therapy over control conditions. Three studies (Veale 1993; Rimland 1995; Edelson 1999) reported improvements at three months for the auditory integration therapy group based on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist, but they used a total score rather than subgroup scores, which is of questionable validity, and Veale's results did not reach statistical significance. Rimland 1995 also reported improvements at three months in the auditory integration therapy group for the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist subgroup scores. The study addressing Tomatis therapy (Corbett 2008) described an improvement in language with no difference between treatment and control conditions and did not report on the behavioural outcomes that were used in the auditory integration therapy trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 12:49:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies are effective as treatments for autism spectrum disorders. As synthesis of existing data has been limited by the disparate outcome measures used between studies, there is not sufficient evidence to prove that this treatment is not effective. However, of the seven studies including 182 participants that have been reported to date, only two (with an author in common), involving a total of 35 participants, report statistically significant improvements in the auditory intergration therapy group and for only two outcome measures (Aberrant Behaviour Checklist and Fisher's Auditory Problems Checklist). As such, there is no evidence to support the use of auditory integration therapy at this time.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Autism spectrum disorders</HEADING>
<P>Autism refers to a wide spectrum of associated cognitive and behavioural disorders and was first described in the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Kanner-1943" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanner 1943</LINK>). Core features include impairments in socialisation and verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted patterns of behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Filipek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filipek 1999</LINK>). DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) uses the term "Pervasive Developmental Disorders" to include autistic disorder, Rett's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger's disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). ICD-10 has a similar but not identical diagnostic classification system (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). More recently, the term autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been developed because children with the abnormalities of communication, behaviour or social interaction seen in autism but who do not fulfil all the diagnostic criteria for autism have been identified. Most people agree that autism spectrum disorders encompass autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, semantic-pragmatic disorder (not included in DSM-IV) and PDD-NOS. Childhood disintegrative disorder and Rett's disorder are usually excluded from this grouping. Current practice requires that autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed using either the DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>) classification systems. Several diagnostic instruments have also been developed to assist with diagnostic classification. These include a behavioural assessment, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1999</LINK>); interview tools, the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1994</LINK>) and the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1999</LINK>); and a computerised parent completed questionnaire, the 3Di (<LINK REF="REF-Skuse-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuse 2004</LINK>), the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale(GARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 1995</LINK>) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Schopler-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schopler 1980</LINK>). ASD have been reported to affect between 0.7 to 21.1 per 10,000 children (<LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 1999</LINK>). Currently there is no single known cause. Most experts would contend that autistic symptoms are the result of a variety of aetiologies affecting the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-Gillberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillberg 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Abnormal responses to sensory stimuli</HEADING>
<P>Abnormal responses to sensory stimuli (for example, ear covering or screaming, apparent deafness) may be the manifestations of auditory hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity. Such responses are important and are common characteristics encountered in autistic individuals. They do not, however, form part of the core criteria for diagnosis of an ASD. Abnormal responses to other stimuli (including visual perception, temperature or pain) can also be present (<LINK REF="REF-Gillberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillberg 2000</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of therapy for autism spectrum disorders</HEADING>
<P>Given the heterogeneity of ASD and the knowledge that there is no single known aetiology, a range of interventions and therapies have been developed. They include education interventions specifically addressing the core social and communication impairments of autism, pharmacological therapies and a wide range of 'alternative' therapies including diet, vitamins, auditory and sensory integration. Overall, educational and behavioural methods remain the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1995</LINK>). Pharmacological treatments may be useful adjuncts to behavioural intervention in improving comorbid conditions in individuals with autism, for example, hyperactivity, aggression and obsessive-compulsive behaviours. They do not necessarily influence the underlying primary social impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Gringras-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gringras 2000</LINK>). Many of the alternative therapies for autism are time-consuming and expensive. Anecdotal reports of improvement or cure, however, have ensured their continuation despite a lack of clinical trial-based evidence. One of these treatments involves a variety of sound or 'auditory integration' therapies. Types of this therapy are listed below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Auditory integration training (Berard's method)</HEADING>
<P>First developed in France in 1982 (<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1982</LINK>), with a later English translation (<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1993</LINK>), Berard postulated that abnormal sensitivity or insensitivity to certain frequencies of sound waves, regardless of overall hearing ability, was associated with a range of behaviour and learning problems (<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1993</LINK>). Berard believed that his technique of auditory integration training (AIT) would bring about a 're-education' of the hearing process. No other explanations for how AIT is effective have been put forward. Berard, in most cases, reported an improvement in the behaviour or learning problems. He applied AIT to a variety of disorders including autism, depression, hyperactivity and learning difficulties. Personal accounts have attributed autistic symptoms such as stereotypies, lack of emotional response and inappropriate distress to distorted sensory input. AIT, believed to address abnormal sound sensitivity specifically, may theoretically improve the problem and hence the associated disabling symptoms. The technique gained wide popularity following the publication of Stelhi's book <I>The Sound of a Miracle. A Child's Triumph over Autism</I>, which reported the complete recovery of the author's daughter Georgie (diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia) following 10 hours of training in Berard's clinic (<LINK REF="REF-Stehli-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehli 1991</LINK>). AIT involves 10 hours of listening to electronically modified music delivered by headphones during two half-hour sessions each day for 10 days. The AIT device uses filtering to dampen the peak frequencies to which the individual is 'hypersensitive' and delivers sounds modulated by random dampening of high and low frequencies and intensities (<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tomatis Method</HEADING>
<P>Tomatis sound therapy, developed by Dr Alfred Tomatis, uses electronically modified human voice and music delivered via the "Electronic Ear" (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgaertel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgaertel 1999</LINK>). Programmes are individualised with the duration of therapy varying and breaks scheduled between treatment blocks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Samonas Sound Therapy</HEADING>
<P>Samonas therapy involves listening through headphones to filtered music, voice and sounds of nature recorded on compact discs. Therapy takes place under a therapist's supervision and also at home. The therapy was developed by Steinbach using the work of Tomatis (<LINK REF="REF-Boon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boon 2011</LINK>). The duration and frequency of treatment for each individual patient is at the discretion of the therapist and there are no specific guidelines.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-21 02:06:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In practice, all three methods of AIT involve listening to electronically modified music for varying periods of time and are intended to ameliorate auditory processing defects and improve concentration. Each therapist appears to be practising their own version of these methods and may modify treatment to suit the individual patient. This raises theoretical concerns as to whether such methods are comparable, due to the variation in intensity and exposure time. Nevertheless, most of the proponents of these therapies claim the same benefits. A wide range of disorders, including autism, learning difficulties, hyperactivity disorders and depression, have been addressed by the described methods of AIT.</P>

<P>A total of 278 titles and abstracts were reviewed for the initial publication (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) with a further 388 records reviewed for the current update (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Of the databases searched, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ERIC yielded relevant abstracts, several of which were replicated between databases. There were no language restrictions for the search however all articles reviewed were written in English. The search strategy was translated into Spanish and Portuguese (in addition to English) for the LILACS database. Of the 278 titles and abstracts initially screened, 264 were not relevant to the review but had been identified by the wide search strategy. We reviewed the remaining 14 studies formally as full papers. We excluded 10 studies as they did not involve sound therapies or individuals with ASD, or were not RCTs. For the current update, we screened 388 titles and abstracts with one RCT of Tomatis therapy formally reviewed as a full paper and one review article of AIT excluded. We included seven trials in the final review, five of which were found via electronic searches as described above. We identified two additional studies from a review of reference lists and unpublished studies (see below). Six of seven included studies focused on AIT; we found one trial involving Tomatis therapy.</P>

<P>We included seven studies. The number of participants in the seven studies ranged from 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>) to 80 (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>); most studies had 20 or fewer participants (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). Three of the studies included both children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>); while the remainder included only children aged three to 17 years (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different diagnostic definitions of autism were used for inclusion of participants. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) confirmed diagnosis using DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and ICD-10 classifications (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>), with another (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>) using DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) corroborated by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and clinical judgement. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>) used the Rimland Diagnostic E-2 checklist as well as diagnosis from an independent source, for example, a physician or psychologist (<LINK REF="REF-Rimland-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimland 1971</LINK>). Bettison confirmed that diagnoses were made by different means, which could not always be precisely determined as they were not made for the purposes of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>). Diagnosis was made by unspecified independent agencies in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>). The participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK> included 21 'cognitively impaired' individuals and nine autistic individuals. Communication with the author confirmed that all 30 participants would fulfil DSM-IV criteria for an autism spectrum disorder however some had arrived in the institution prior to DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment period was uniform for all the AIT trials, consisting of AIT for 10 consecutive days with two 30-minute sessions per day. Studies differed in regard to the machine model and type of music administered. Control conditions were generally the same across the included studies, that is, listening to unmodified music through headphones for the same time period as the treatment group. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) the music was played directly within the room for the control group, with non-functional headphones. The study addressing Tomatis therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>) involved the Tomatis Method for four blocks lasting three weeks each, followed by a break for a total of 18 weeks. The placebo condition involved listening to commercially produced compact discs of the same music without an active microphone or the "Electronic Ear".</P>
<P>The outcome measures used in the studies varied considerably, as illustrated in the outcome measures table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Five of the trials used the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) presented total and subgroup scores, with the remaining two studies including total scores only (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>). In four trials, the ABC was completed by the parents of participants, and in one (<LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>) the ABC was completed by staff at a residential institution. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>, ABC data were collected on a 24-hour basis by staff for one week at each post-treatment interval and for four weeks during the pre-treatment period. Data were collected monthly by parents and one teacher for the duration of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>, except during vacation periods. The period the observers were reporting on was not stated. In three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>), parents were asked, when completing the ABC, to consider the behaviour of the participant solely over the previous three days. Other outcome measures used in more than one trial included the Fisher's Auditory Problem Checklist (FAPC) (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1980</LINK>), which was used in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>); the 'parent' version of the Conners' Rating Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1990</LINK>), which was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>); the Leiter International Performance scale (<LINK REF="REF-Leiter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiter 1980</LINK>), which was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>); and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>). In addition to standardised outcome measures, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) used the investigators' direct observations of the participants' behaviour and reports by parents.</P>

<P>The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>) did not use the ABC as an outcome measure and instead used the Autism Behavior Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 1980</LINK>), which is part of a broader tool, the Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning (ASIEP) (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 1978</LINK>). The Autism Behavior Checklist is designed to be completed independently by a parent or a teacher familiar with the child, who then returns it to a trained professional for scoring and interpretation. Although it is primarily designed to identify children with autism within a population of school-aged children with severe disabilities, the Autism Behavior Checklist has been used with children as young as three years of age. Using this instrument, <LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK> reported an improvement in both groups, but no significant between-group differences were found when the effects of group and time, and their interaction, were analysed. <LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK> reported a significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in the Fisher's Auditory Problems Checklist (FAPC) (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1980</LINK>) scores for the treatment group, however data were not collected beyond three months follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK> reported no significant improvement for the Conners' Rating Scales - Parent (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1990</LINK>), the FAPC (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1980</LINK>) or the ABC (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>), only a "trending towards positive therapeutic effects"; again data were not collected beyond three months. <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK> used direct observational data in addition to behaviour rating scales. Overall combined data from parents, teachers and observers did not demonstrate a benefit with AIT.<BR/>
<BR/>Further problems with data analysis occurred because of the reporting or supply of group means at baseline and post-treatment, rather than mean differences. In the study by Zollweg (<LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>), where baseline and three month post-intervention means were supplied, t-tests of the between-group differences at baseline were not significant (P = 0.06). As no data of this type were available for the other trials, it was not possible to assess how large the treatment group differences may have been at baseline.<BR/>
<BR/>Meta-analysis of changes in the ABC subgroup scores three months post-intervention for two eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>) was deemed inappropriate as inconsistency between these studies was high. This inconsistency may have been due to the many differences between the studies, notably participant characteristics, where Zollweg recruited institutionalised participants with known cognitive impairment (stating in a later personal communication that all participants would have met diagnostic criteria for autism (<LINK REF="REF-Zollweg-2002-_x0028_pers-comm_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zollweg 2002 (pers comm)</LINK>) while Rimland recruited home-based participants previously diagnosed with autism. Other differences included data collection: in one case this was undertaken by staff members over a period of a week (<LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>) and in the other by parents, who had been asked to focus on the previous three days only (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>). Finally, data were presented by Zollweg at baseline and post-treatment in the form of means, while point estimates were imputed from Rimland's reported t-test scores.</P>
<P>No other outcomes for behavioural problems employed more than one consistently reported measure with data in a suitable form for meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK> used the Leiter International Performance Scale (LIPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Leiter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiter 1980</LINK>). Mudford also used the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Sparrow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparrow 1984</LINK>) and the Reynell Language Developmental Scales-III (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1997</LINK>). Mudford's trial did not report significant cognitive improvements for either the AIT or control groups after 14 months follow-up, whereas Bettison described improvements for both groups at six and 12 months. All data were presented as group mean scores pre- and post-intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK> used the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (<LINK REF="REF-Thorndike-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorndike 1986</LINK>) to measure intellectual ability (IQ); however there was considerable variability in the IQ at baseline, making these data difficult to interpret.</P>

Zollweg measured 'loudness discomfort levels' and reported no significant differences between the groups. Similarly, Rimland, whose study included a 'Hearing Sensitivity Questionnaire' and a 'Pure Tone Discomfort Test' did not report any reduction in sound sensitivity for either group. Bettison described improvements for both groups using a 'Sound Sensitivity Questionnaire'. As these outcome measures were both diverse and non-standardised, meta-analysis was not possible.</P>

Both Bettison and Rimland asked parents to complete a checklist or questionnaire during the 10 days of AIT therapy in order to collect information on possible side effects. Minor physical complaints were reported in both groups for both studies, and no significant differences were found between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK> mentioned minor side effects that were reported anecdotally by parents at the end of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK> did not report the recording of adverse events in their trials.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-21 04:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, data synthesis was limited by statistical and clinical heterogeneity. The studies reported a disparate range of clinical outcomes, many of which were used by only one study. Variation in statistical methods was common between studies and data were presented in forms that could not be converted for use in RevMan software.</P>
<P>The largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>) did not report a difference between treatment and control conditions. One small cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) also reported no long-term benefits of AIT. Although three small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>) reported an improvement in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores in the AIT group at three months, the clinical relevance of these results is uncertain because the total score of the ABC is not, according to the instrument's developer, a clinically meaningful outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>). The author of the instrument has stated that the use of a 'total aberrant score' is incorrect and inconsistent with the instrument's design. Results should be presented as the five subscale scores (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>). The only trial that used such subscales (<LINK REF="STD-Rimland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rimland 1995</LINK>) did note an improvement in ABC subscale scores in the AIT group at three months. One small cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>) addressed the effect of Tomatis therapy on language and demonstrated no difference between the treatment and placebo groups.</P>
<P>The age range of participants in this review was wide. It was not possible to analyse the results for different age groups, nor was this discussed in any of the studies. This is a concern because there is a general belief that early intervention is best, particularly in the case of language acquisition. Given that language skills are best acquired in young children, it is possible that greater improvements would be seen in a younger sample, or that improvements in language in younger participants might be masked by fewer gains in a generally older sample. Future research that measures language acquisition should be more specific about participant age. Likewise, duration of follow-up is important for a 'lifetime' condition like autism, and in the trials included in this review it never exceeded 14 months (<LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We only found one small trial addressing Tomatis therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2008</LINK>). The failure to find any trials involving the use of other sound therapies for individuals with ASD further illustrates the paucity of peer-reviewed information. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>), using two standardised behavioural checklists, performed a power analysis to calculate sample size and included a total of 80 participants. This study did not demonstrate a difference between the treatment and control conditions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Berard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berard 1993</LINK> did not specify the outputs intended for AIT. However, questions have been raised as to the potential harms of AIT (<LINK REF="REF-Lucker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucker 1998</LINK>), particularly regarding whether output levels of the machines exceed safe limits. <LINK REF="REF-Lucker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucker 1998</LINK> concluded that AIT will not put listeners at risk of hearing loss provided practitioners use lower rather than maximal settings on the equipment. Four of the trial authors described the output used for their machines (<LINK REF="STD-Bettison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bettison 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zollweg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zollweg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudford-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mudford 2000</LINK>) and described compliance with manufacturers' recommendations or adjustment to a comfortable level.</P>
<P>A statement issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2007</LINK>), reaffirmed in 2010, endorsed the lack of benefit of AIT based on the Cochrane review (first published in 2004) and the methodological problems associated with the available research.There are also concerns about the validity and theoretical basis of the therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gravel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravel 1994</LINK>). AIT continues to be practised worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-AIT-institute-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIT institute 2011</LINK>) despite evidence which still shows it to be an experimental treatment at best, and which may only be available at a considerable financial cost to the family.</P>

<P>Given the lack of evidence that auditory integration training (AIT) or other sound therapies are effective as a treatment for autism, future research is discouraged. However, we suggest that any further trials of AIT should build on existing evidence and provide high level evidence about whether this treatment is effective for outcomes that are relevant to individuals with ASD.</P>
<P>To provide this level of evidence, future trials should:<BR/>1. use gold-standard criteria for diagnosing autism, so that groups can be compared;<BR/>2. use sample sizes capable of detecting differences, if these exist;<BR/>3. use outcome measures that are valid and clinically meaningful;<BR/>4. present information in a way that is accepted for randomised control trials;<BR/>5. consider the effect of intellectual ability, age of participant at treatment, severity of symptoms and other potential subgroup variations so that clinically meaningful information is provided;<BR/>6. collect information about potential confounders, such as other therapy, so between-group equivalence can be established.</P>

<P>Response to the Review Article by Sinha, Silove, Wheeler and Williams (2004): Auditory Integration Training and Other Sound Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorders<BR/>Bernard Rimland and Stephen M. Edelson</P>
<P>Autism Research Institute, San Diego, California</P>
<P>We strongly disagree with the conclusions reached by Sinha, Silove, Wheeler and Williams (2004) in their review of the efficacy of auditory integration training (AIT) as a treatment for autism.</P>
<P>The present authors have recently completed a review of all 28 papers on the efficacy of AIT that we were able to find (January 1993 through August 2004). Twenty-three reports concluded that AIT benefits various subgroups, three studies reported no benefit, or no benefit over that seen in the control group, and two studies reported rather ambiguous or contradictory results. In our view, the balance of the evidence clearly favors AIT as a useful intervention for autism. (Our review can be seen at www.AutismResearchInstitute.com.)</P>
<P>The review by Sinha et al. covered only 6 of the 28 studies referred to above. Our conclusions about each of these studies are diametrically opposed to the conclusions reached by Sinha et al. We will limit our discussion to these six studies:</P>
<P>All three studies which Sinha et al. claim to provide credible evidence that AIT is ineffective as a treatment for autism fail to do so:</P>
<P>Bettison (1996) could reach no valid conclusion about the efficacy of AIT because none of the measures of efficacy she employed was designed to nor capable of measuring treatment efficacy. (See Note 1 below)</P>
<P>The study by Mudford et al. (2000) was deeply flawed, as we called to Mudford's attention at the time. Mudford and his colleagues reported significant improvement in both the AIT and the placebo group. However, AIT starts a process that often takes a minimum of three months to produce significant results. The significant improvement seen in the "placebo" group could reasonably attributed to these subjects having received AIT in the first phase of the study, prior to the crossover. (See Note 2)</P>
<P>The Zollweg et al. study (1997)'s subject population included fewer than one-third subjects who were autistic, the remainder being mentally retarded. This was established in a published interview in 1996 with David Palm, the senior researcher. No one has claimed AIT to be a treatment for mentally retarded individuals. (See Note 3)</P>
<P>The three studies which Sinha et al. claim to provide no credible evidence that AIT is effective do, in fact, support the efficacy of AIT:</P>
<P>Edelson et al. (1999), Rimland and Edelson (1995), and Veale (1993): These studies are considered to be of only marginal relevance by Sinha et al., on the grounds that the authors used the Total scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), rather than the 5 subscale scores, since the 5 subscales are said to be largely independent. That is an invalid argument, akin to claiming that grade-point average is not a valid measure of student achievement, since it is based on grades in such disparate courses as history, mathematics, philosophy, and geography. Clearly, since the 5 ABC subscales measure various aspects of aberrant behavior, persons with the highest Total scores may be said to exhibit the most aberrant behavior. We discussed this matter with Michael Aman, senior author of the ABC, in the early 1990s, and again more recently (August 12th, 2004). While Aman does prefer that the 5 subscale scores be used, he acknowledges the legitimacy of analyzing the Total scores. In the present instance, where the Total score shows significant differences between the treatment and control groups, he said the findings provided "compelling" evidence of the appropriateness of using the Total ABC score as an index of intervention effectiveness. Aman's annotated bibliography of ABC research (1993) cites, without criticism, our use of the Total score in one of our AIT studies (later published in 1995) that Sinha et al. reject on invalid grounds. (See Note 4)</P>
<P>The rejection by Sinha et al. of the above studies reporting positive results of AIT on the grounds that the authors used ABC Total scores, rather than ABC subtest scores, is inappropriate. We thus disagree with Sinha et al. not only in their conclusion that the studies by Bettison, Mudford and Zollweg serve to discredit AIT, but we also reject Sinha et al.'s conclusion that the studies by Edelson et al., Rimland and Edelson, and Veale fail to demonstrate the efficacy of AIT.</P>
<P>We therefore wish to reiterate the conclusion that we reached after our careful review of the 28 studies we were able to identify:</P>
<P>"Our review of the available literature on AIT has produced 23 studies with positive results and only 3 claiming no benefits from AIT. While none of the research done thus far on AIT is of Nobel Prize quality, the positive studies are far more credible than those with negative results. As we point out in our comments, the three studies that claimed no benefits are deeply flawed, with conclusions that are not supported by the research procedures nor the research data.</P>
<P>AIT does, in fact, appear to be a worthwhile, frequently beneficial intervention which confers improvement on a number of symptoms, in a significant proportion of disorders on the autism spectrum."</P>
<P>In concluding their negative evaluation of AIT, Sinha et al. commented that AIT "may only be available at considerable financial cost to the family." Again, we disagree: Guy Berard, who developed what is now called AIT (the present authors, BR and SME, coined the term 'Auditory Integration Training' or AIT) because Berard thought that a fast, low-cost alternative treatment to the very expensive, long-term Tomatis treatment was needed. Berard had been a student of Tomatis before he developed AIT as a short-term, inexpensive alternative. The Berard AIT treatment is preferably administered in two 30-minute sessions per day over a 10-day period, at a cost of approximately $1000 (the cost varies).</P>
<P>In view of all of the above, what is an intelligent and concerned parent to do? We believe, as stated above, that there is sufficient evidence available to justify the continued practice of AIT, although we agree with Sinha et al. that more quality research is needed.</P>
<P>From a parent's viewpoint, their children are alive and growing now. Parents need information now. What is the best information available? Perfect information will never be available. To steer parents away from a safe, inexpensive intervention which is favored by the vast preponderance of available research is counterproductive counsel. A distinction must be made between "not proven to the nth degree" and "worth trying in view of the considerations of safety, cost and convenience." Our assessment, and our advice to parents is, accordingly "If you can afford it, give it a try!"</P>
<P>Note 1 - Bettison (1996)</P>
<P>Bettison's results indicated significant improvement in both the experimental (AIT) and placebo groups, but no differences between the two groups. Bettison attributed these improvements to listening to music in a structured environment. However, critics have interpreted these findings as evidence of 'no benefits' associated with AIT, which is a debatable point.</P>
<P>While Bettison's study is exemplary in many respects, the instruments used to assess changes associated with AIT had severe shortcomings. Bettison (1996) used the Autism Behavior Checklist (Krug, Arick &amp; Almond, 1980) to evaluate changes in behavior. In their review article, Sinha et al. stated that there were improvements in both the experimental (AIT) and placebo groups using this checklist, and there were no differences between the two groups. Sinha and her colleagues did acknowledge that the Autism Behavior Checklist was "primarily designed to identify children with autism," but they did not bring up the validity issue regarding the use of this checklist to evaluate treatment effectiveness. The first author of this checklist, Dave Krug, has stated that the checklist was not designed to evaluate treatment efficacy (Personal communication).</P>
<P>Bettison used a modified version of the Hearing Sensitivity Questionnaire (HSQ) designed by Rimland and Edelson (1991). The HSQ was designed only as a survey of sound sensitivity in the autism population and not as an instrument to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Rimland and Edelson did not use it as an assessment measure in any of their three studies on AIT. Additionally, Bettison employed a scoring method for the HSQ that was said to provide a measure of the person's degree of sound sensitivity. This scoring method lacks even face validity (i.e., the appearance that the checklist is valid). For example, if a parent agreed with the item: 'Have there been certain sounds which the person does not seem to hear?,' this response was considered an indication of hypersensitivity to sounds rather than hyposensitivity to sounds.</P>
<P>Another measure used in Bettison's study, the Developmental Behavior Checklist, had been used previously in clinical settings, but it also was not designed to measure treatment effectiveness.</P>
<P>Note 2 - Mudford et al. (2000)</P>
<P>Although the significant improvements seen in those in the placebo condition were dismissed by Mudford et al., it is quite possible that these improvements may have been due to the subjects having received AIT eight months earlier (i.e., they may have participated in the AIT group prior to the crossover). This is a real possibility given: (a) the two areas of improvement in the placebo group are consistent with findings associated with AIT; and (b) Rimland and Edelson (1995) and Gillberg et al. (1998) have documented improvement up to 9 months following AIT. The present authors called this possibility to Mudford's attention and suggested that the data be reanalyzed to test it. Mudford refused, claiming that additional analyses of the data would increase the likelihood of error. On the contrary, reanalysis of the data would have decreased the likelihood of error.</P>
<P>Sinha and her colleagues also requested the data from the Mudford et al. study, but they were unable to obtain them. According to the guidelines in the American Psychological Association Publication Manual (2001, page 354), guidelines adopted by many scientific journals, researchers must make their published data available to other researchers for at least five years after the publication of their findings.</P>
<P>Note 3 - Zollweg et al. (1997)</P>
<P>There are several severe problems with this study. First, the title should have stated</P>
<P>"&#8230; in a Mixed Population" since fewer than a third of the subjects were autistic. One cannot generalize these findings to the autism population. Neither Berard, nor any other responsible investigator, has proposed AIT as a treatment for mental retardation. Second, the volume level was much higher than recommended. The recommended volume level is 80 dB SPL or lower. The decibel level in the Zollweg et al. study was measured as high as 122 dB SPL. Finally, an analysis of the audiograms in their study indicated that 27% of the subjects were given the wrong narrow band filters. Given these methodological flaws, the Zollweg et al. findings are not applicable even to the mentally retarded population.</P>
<P>Sinha et al. stated: "Communication with the author confirmed all 30 participants would fulfill DSM-IV criteria for an autism spectrum disorder, however some had arrived in the institution prior to DSM-IV (APA 1994)." However, David Palm, the senior researcher in the study, stated that "the subjects were mildly to profoundly retarded, and some were autistic and had behavioral disturbances" (Gelman, 1996). The recent assertion made by one of the authors, seven years later, that the subjects were autistic, is not credible.</P>
<P>Note 4 - Aman's concern is that by summing the scores across different subscales, an improvement on one subscale may cancel a worsening of behavior on another subscale. True, however, the other side of that coin is that if the Total score is not derived, one risks overlooking non-significant changes on the subscales that would, in aggregate, reveal a significance between- group difference. The best answer: use both Total and subscale scores, as was done in the Rimland and Edelson (1995) study.</P>

<P>We write in reply to Dr Edelson's comments. We believe his criticisms can be addressed under the following five areas:</P>
<P>1. Inclusion of data only from randomised controlled trials: Dr Edelson suggests that the findings from this review do not present a complete view of all evidence in favour of AIT as we present only data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Cochrane reviews typically include only data from RCTs because such trials are at lower risk of bias compared to study designs such as uncontrolled or unblinded cohort or case control studies. As such, RCTs provide data that is more likely to be valid. Of the 23 studies Dr Edelson refers to as supporting AIT to treat autism, 14 are uncontrolled or have no placebo group, two are single-subject studies, two are animal studies, one is a survey and one uses children with central auditory processing disorder. Only two studies are randomised controlled trials and thus eligible for inclusion in our systematic review.</P>
<P>2. Inclusion of data from a mixed population: Dr Edelson states that the population detailed in the Zollweg 1997 study consisted of participants who may not have all been autistic. The participants did have multiple disabilities and the publication states their primary diagnosis based on DSM III criteria, that is, either autistic or cognitively impaired. In our communication with Prof Zollweg (15th August 2002) he states many participants arrived at the Chileda Institute, where the trial was conducted, prior to the DSM-IV, and that "all subjects would have had a primary diagnosis of ASD". It is based on this information that this trial was included.</P>
<P>3. Problems with outcome measures: The authors of this review acknowledge that many of the tools used to assess treatment in the included trials are not designed for this purpose and may, therefore, not detect a clinically significant improvement. With the possible exception of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (see point 4), many of the tools used are essentially diagnostic or screening tools. However, the authors of the included trials used those tests available at the time. Systematic reviews can comment on limitations of existing studies but cannot change the outcome measures used. The lack of sensitive, validated tools to assess treatment effect in children and adults with autism is a legitimate problem in autism research. It results in the use of many different outcome measures both within and across RCTs. In this systematic review, six trials used 17 different outcome measures. Other systematic reviews in preparation further highlight this problem. More assessments and analysis performed in the pursuit of a positive treatment effect result in undermining the validity of a study's findings as this process increases the likelihood of type 1 error, that is, finding a positive result where no clinical improvement exists. It is crucial to the continued evaluation of treatments for autism that outcome measures be developed or re-evaluated for their ability to assess change, the clinical importance of such change to carers and clinicians, and that consumers be involved in this process. Until this time, the use of multiple outcome measures remains inappropriate.</P>
<P>4. Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Total Scores: Dr Edelson contends that Dr Michael Aman, the author of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (Aman and Singh 1986) recently agreed with him that it was 'legitimate' to analyse total ABC scores. Our discussions with Dr Aman do not reflect this view. Dr Aman states that "the scale lacks validity if the subscales are not retained" (M. Aman, personal communication 1, 2nd December 2004)</P>
<P>Further, "the Manual [Aberrant Behaviour Checklist] has no norms for Total scores for a reason. We have published several normative and comparison studies and have never reported Total scores. I maintain an Annotated Bibliography on the ABC, which has about 145 studies summarized. Almost none of the studies included there have reported Total scores." (M Aman, personal communication 2, 2nd December 2004).</P>
<P>It is possible that differences resulting from treatment with AIT were not detected in any study because the ABC subscales used to assess change post treatment were not sufficiently sensitive. However, this problem cannot be resolved by adding the subscales to provide a total when the tool has not been designed or validated for this purpose. To do so increases the potential for type 1 error.</P>
<P>5. Cross-over. We acknowledge the possibility of carry-over of improvement from AIT treatment to the placebo group in cross-over studies and believe there is not yet sufficient evidence to designate a defined wash-out period of the effects of AIT. This is why results prior to cross-over were sought and used where possible, and why meta-analysis was not attempted when only cross-over data were available.</P>
<P>The authors of this review made every attempt to access data from AIT and control groups prior to any cross-over of treatment. Access to such data was not possible for the Mudford study. While this is unfortunate, there was no deliberate obstruction by trialists. The first author does not reside in the country where the data is stored, research staff have moved-on due to funding constraints and data has been stored in an inaccessible place because of a paucity of working space.</P>
<P>However, the overall findings of the Mudford trial were included in the systematic review because we do not agree with Dr Edelson that there is sufficient documented improvement up to 9 months following AIT to dismiss the findings of this study based on potential carry-over of improvement. The authors of one study cited by Dr Edelson to support this claim do not agree that their study shows either clinical or statistical improvement at nine months (Gillberg 1998).</P>
<P>All treatments have associated 'costs' including monetary expenditure (AIT currently costs $US1300 for a two-session treatment block), change to life-style, feelings of hope that may not be justified if treatments are not effective, and feelings of guilt, frustration and anger if treatments can not be accessed. We agree with Dr Edelson that parents of children and individuals affected by autism deserve best level evidence about treatment effectiveness so they can make well informed decisions about treatment options. Service providers also need this evidence to make informed decisions about prioritising treatments offered. We do not agree that the 'vast preponderance of available research' supports AIT. Our review shows that the best available evidence of treatment effect, RCTs, which used outcome measures to assess change in diagnostic features of autism and other behaviours, and incorporated parent reports, do not support AIT as an effective treatment for autism. Thus, AIT can not be recommended as an effective treatment at this time. This review will be updated to accommodate new evidence about treatment effectiveness if/when it becomes available.</P>
