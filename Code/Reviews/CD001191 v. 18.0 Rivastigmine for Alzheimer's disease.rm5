<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed evidence comparing the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine with placebo in people with Alzheimer's disease.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care.</P>
<P>Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms.</P>
<P>The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholine inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Results from seven trials showed that patients on rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day by mouth, or 9.5 mg/day by skin patch) were better for three outcomes than those on placebo, after six months of treatment. The differences were quite small for cognitive function (2 points, using the ADAS-Cog which has a range of 70 points) and activities of daily living (standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.20, which is considered a small effect). Patients on rivastigmine were more likely to show overall improvement compared with those on placebo (odds ratio of 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.25 to 1.72) . However, there was no difference for behavioural changes (reported by three trials) or impact on carers (reported by one trial). Patients on rivastigmine were also about twice as likely to experience adverse events, although this risk might have been slightly less for patients using patches compared with capsules. It was possible that certain types of adverse events were less in people using patches than taking capsules (nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dizziness).</P>
<P>In summary, rivastigmine may be of benefit to people with Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that the using a patch is associated with reduced side effects compared to using oral capsules.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:38:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA.</P>

<P>To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-18 11:11:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR  exelon OR ENA OR "SDZ ENA 713". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:17:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-18 11:13:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:38:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. </P>
<P>Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo.</P>
<P>Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies.</P>
<P>After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies).</P>
<P>Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-18 11:32:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. All the studies with usable data were industry funded or sponsored. This review has not examined economic data.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-10 11:15:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:35:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:23:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alzheimer's disease (AD), alone or in combination with other brain conditions, is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. It is associated with the loss of cholinergic neurons in parts of the brain subserving aspects of memory. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform their usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe AD, people lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care.</P>
<P>Currently there is no cure available for AD, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:33:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts and may enhance cholinergic neurotransmission.</P>
<P>Tacrine, the first of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant disadvantages, including low oral bioavailability and metabolism involving hepatic microsomal enzymes with a consequent risk of interactions with other drugs. Tacrine was also associated with adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Several other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil, have now been introduced. They are believed to have superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low incidence of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Rivastigmine is a 'pseudo-irreversible' inhibitor of acetyl and butyrylcholinesterases with a phenylcarbamate structure, the metabolism of which is almost totally independent of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. After binding to cholinesterase, the carbamate portion of rivastigmine is slowly hydrolysed, cleaved, conjugated to a sulphate and excreted. Rivastigmine has an oral bioavailability of 0.355 and low (40%) binding to plasma proteins. Its elimination half-life is around two hours. Its disposition is essentially unaltered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Jann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jann 2000</LINK>) and the risk of interactions with other drugs is low (<LINK REF="REF-Grossberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossberg 2000</LINK>). This is of particular relevance for elderly patients with AD, some of whom may also need medications for other conditions. The drug is selective both to the central nervous system (CNS) and within it. In studies in human volunteers the inhibition of central acetylcholinesterase was substantially greater than the inhibition of peripheral acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1999</LINK>). Evidence from animal studies suggests that rivastigmine is a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase in the cortex and hippocampus, the brain regions most affected by AD (<LINK REF="REF-Polinsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polinsky 1998</LINK>). Rivastigmine also preferentially inhibits the G1 enzymatic form of acetylcholinesterase, which predominates in the brains of patients with AD (<LINK REF="REF-Polinsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polinsky 1998</LINK>). Rivastigmine is long-acting and readily penetrates the CNS after parenteral or oral administration. The duration of cholinesterase inhibition by rivastigmine is approximately 10 hours.</P>
<P>Rivastigmine can be administered orally as capsules or liquid or from a transdermal patch, which has been developed more recently. Based on pharmacokinetic principles, the transdermal patch form was postulated to have advantages over the oral form. Adherence was expected to be improved by once daily dosing. Tolerance was also expected to be improved as the patch delivers a more steady concentration of rivastigmine to the body and has a lower equivalent dose to the oral form (9.5 mg as a transdermal patch is equivalent to 12 mg daily in the oral form).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-20 06:35:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large multicentre trials have been completed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all the member states of the European Union and in the USA, where it received approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in April 2000. It is important to assess the safety and efficacy of this intervention in a systematic review.</P>

<P>Data were extracted from the published reports in journals and unpublished company reports using data collection forms. One review author (JSB) extracted information from the reports of each study.</P>
<P>In addition to extracting pre-specified information about study characteristics and aspects of methodology relevant to risk of bias, the following summary statistics, required for each trial and each outcome, were extracted.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For continuous data, mean change from baseline, the standard deviation, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted, if available.</LI>
<LI>For binary data, the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought.</LI>
<LI>For ordinal variables which can be approximated to continuous variables, the main outcomes of interest were the assessment score at the time point being considered and the change from baseline (i.e. pre-randomisation or at randomisation) at this time point. For some binary and ordinal outcomes the endpoint category relative to the baseline category was the outcome of interest. For other categorical outcomes, such as the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), the endpoint itself was of clinical relevance as all patients had begun, by definition, at the same baseline score.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The baseline assessment score was the latest available score, no longer than two months prior to the randomisation. Studies may have included a titration period prior to the randomisation phase of the study. Data from any open follow-on phase, after the randomised phase, were not used to assess safety or efficacy.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), the data were sought irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. If ITT data were not available, an analysis of patients who completed treatment was conducted.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:03:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias assessment was conducted using the standard recommended approach for assessing the risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool is available in RevMan 5.2 and assesses the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants and personnel;</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcomes assessment;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting;</LI>
<LI>'other bias'.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We made a judgement about the risk of bias in each domain, assigning it to one of three categories: 'high', 'low' or 'unclear' risk of bias. These assessments were based on the criteria for making judgements that are listed in section 8.5 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. The criteria focus on whether the risk is of importance (that is whether the presence of the risk could have an important impact on the results or the outcomes of the trial) rather than whether a risk of bias is present or not (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The levels of risk may be different for different outcomes and this was considered during the assessment.</P>
<P>If insufficient detail was reported to make a judgement, this was usually considered as an &#8216;unclear' risk of bias. An &#8216;unclear&#8217; judgement was also used in situations where it was clear what happened in the study but its likely impact on the study results was not known.</P>

<P>Only randomised, double-blinded placebo controlled trials or studies comparing different formulations were included in this review. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the review.</P>
<P>Six trials, phase II and III, were all supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and were completed by 1996. They are identified by their Novartis or ADENA code (ADENA was the name given by Novartis to the Exelon Phase III clinical trials programme). The two phase II trials were designed to assess the tolerability, efficacy and safety of rivastigmine over three to four months. The four phase III trials were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of rivastigmine in patients with mild to moderately severe AD over six months. The trials had many features in common. They were all multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials. All trials compared rivastigmine with placebo, with at least two treatment groups of different rivastigmine regimens.</P>
<P>Of the seven later trials, three were also sponsored by Novartis (<LINK REF="STD-IDEAL" TYPE="STUDY">IDEAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Pousa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Pousa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2011</LINK>).

<LI>There is limited information available about <LINK REF="STD-Tai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 2000</LINK>, which has been published only as an abstract. This trial appeared to be an independent trial carried out in Taiwan. Eighty participants with mild to moderate AD were treated with rivastigmine or placebo for 26 weeks. No data were available to include in the meta-analyses.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2005</LINK> was a small 26 week trial (n = 93) with three treatment arms, rivastigmine, quetiapine and placebo, of equal size. The objective was to compare the efficacy of rivastigmine and quetiapine for agitation in people with possible or probable AD who were living in institutions. We did not include any data from this trial in the meta-analyses because of concerns about a high risk of attrition bias and exclusion of the most severely impaired patients from the analyses.</LI>

<P>In anticipation of the typical gastrointestinal adverse events associated with cholinesterase inhibitors, which can be dose-dependent, the various arms of the older trials compared both different doses and twice or thrice daily dosage schedules. Three fixed doses were tested in <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>, but the other trials aimed for a maximum tolerated dose within a prescribed range. The period of titration was longer for larger doses and varied between 3 and 12 weeks. The later trials tested a transdermal patch formulation which provided continuous delivery of the drug with the objective of improving tolerability. The mean daily doses of rivastigmine at different time points are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by recording adverse events and serious adverse events. In addition, routine physical examinations with blood and urine analyses were performed and vital signs and electrocardiograms were checked at all clinic visits. Seven trials reported the withdrawal rate at 26 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B304" TYPE="STUDY">B304</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IDEAL" TYPE="STUDY">IDEAL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez_x002d_Pousa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez-Pousa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the independent trials, <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2005</LINK> had a low risk of allocation bias, with clearly described procedures.

<P>All trials were double-blinded and placebo controlled, with precautions taken to maintain the blinding such as ensuring the placebo was identical in appearance to the active treatment. However, in <LINK REF="STD-B104" TYPE="STUDY">B104</LINK> the placebo group received the treatment twice daily whereas one of the treatment arms received the intervention three times daily. There were no descriptions of additional steps taken to mask this. The difference in the number of times the capsules were taken could have unmasked the three times per day group. The effectiveness of double-blinding in <LINK REF="STD-Mowla-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mowla 2007</LINK> was also unclear because all patients in this study had received the placebo during the six week pre-randomisation run-in period.</P>

<P>Attrition bias was a major concern. There were substantial losses from <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2005</LINK> where 19% (6/31) of those randomised to rivastigmine did not start treatment compared with 6% of those randomised to placebo. Only 18/31 in the rivastigmine group completed the trial compared with 27/31 in the placebo group. Those with a low baseline score on the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) were not included in the analyses. These concerns led us to exclude data from <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2005</LINK> from the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Karaman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karaman 2005</LINK>, although the longest duration included trial (52 weeks), lost very few patients: only 3 of 24 in the rivastigmine group and none from the placebo group. This was a much lower rate of loss than for any other trial.</P>
<P>For the other 11 studies missing assessments caused major problems in the analysis and interpretation of the results. Approximately 17% of patients from the 1 to 4 mg daily and placebo groups and 35% of patients from the 6 to 12 mg daily groups left the trial before completing treatment. If patients dropped out at random from each group, that is the dropout was not associated with the treatment, the comparisons between groups are not biased but estimates of differences are reduced in precision. However, the dropout rates were not random and were related to treatment. Various methods were used in the trials for dealing with missing data.</P>
<P>The older trials (<LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B304" TYPE="STUDY">B304</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK>) reported in detail the methods using for dealing with missing data. Approximately a third of the patients who dropped out contributed endpoint data (retrieved drop out (RDO)). The ITT analyses included the completers (observed cases (OC)) data and the RDO data, and for the remainder of the patients the last available assessment (last observation carried forward (LOCF)). This remainder comprised approximately 6% of the patients in the placebo and 1 to 4 mg daily groups, and 24% for the 6 to 12 mg daily group at 26 weeks. An overestimate of the outcome effect would be expected.</P>
<P>In order to compare the different methods of dealing with missing assessments, for two outcomes (ADAS-Cog and CIBIC-Plus) we conducted meta-analyses on three different groups of patients: OC only, RDO + OC, and ITT (OC + RDO + LOCF). The results are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. These analyses showed that compared with OC or RDO + OC, the ITT analyses did not produce results favouring rivastigmine, indeed the opposite was true but the differences between results were small. Therefore, the ITT analyses were considered satisfactory and were reported for all other outcomes. Further analysis of the data from the ITT, the OC and RDO + OC analyses to investigate the size and direction of the bias due to differential dropouts from the arms of the rivastigmine trials (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2008</LINK>) led to the conclusion that the absolute size of the bias was small and the direction could not be ascertained.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-21 04:04:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the review showed the following main findings.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The currently recommended doses of rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day in two divided doses for capsules and 9.5 mg/day for transdermal patches) have some benefits compared to placebo at 26 weeks for cognitive function, activities of daily living and the physician rated global impression scales. No difference was found for behavioural symptoms or the impact on carers. Patients on rivastigmine are about twice as likely (OR of about 2) to experience adverse events or to withdraw from the trial before the end of the study.</LI>
<LI>Limited evidence from one trial suggests that the transdermal formulation (9.5 mg/day) is as effective as the oral formulation (6 to 12 mg/day) and is associated with a lower incidence of adverse events but does not affect the rate of withdrawals due to adverse events.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The two cognitive tests used, the MMSE and ADAS-Cog, assess similar domains and a high correlation between the results would be expected. The results from 5 studies show that 6 to 12 mg daily of oral rivastigmine improved the cognitive function of patients with mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease treated over a period of 26 weeks, by 0.8 points on the MMSE (range 0 to 30) and by 2.0 points on the ADAS-Cog (range 0 to 70), when compared with placebo. The results from 2 studies show that the 9.5 mg/day of rivastigmine in a transdermal patch improved cognitive function by 0.6 points on the MMSE and 1.4 points on the ADAS-cog when compared with placebo. Pooling the data showed a treatment effect of 0.7 points on the MMSE and 1.8 points on the ADAS-Cog. There was a smaller effect on cognitive function in the 1 to 4 mg daily oral treatment group.</P>
<P>Four studies assessed the effect of 6 to 12 mg daily oral rivastigmine on activities of daily living as reported by a carer using the PDS rating scale (range 0 to 100). Rivastigmine showed a benefit of 2.2 points compared with placebo, but the difference between placebo and 1 to 4 mg daily rivastigmine was not significant. The 10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (9.5 mg/day) patch showed a benefit of 2.2 points on the ADCS-ADL scale (range 0 to 54) when compared with placebo.</P>
<P>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires an independent clinician to assess global clinical state after interviewing the patient and the carer at baseline and the endpoint. When the results of global impression measures were dichotomized to compare the number of patients who improved with the numbers who showed no change or whose condition had deteriorated, the 6 to 12 mg daily group was significantly better than the placebo group at 12 and 26 weeks, and there was a similar significant difference favouring the 1 to 4 mg daily group over placebo at 26 weeks. The 10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (9.5 mg/day) patch was also significantly better than placebo at 24 weeks.The clinician and carer, whilst following the guidelines for the application of the CIBIC-Plus, are essentially making an assessment of whether the patient has improved or not based on criteria relevant to them. This is perhaps closest to what is commonly meant by the term 'meaningful improvement'.</P>
<P>Minimal clinically important differences (MCID), patient derived scores that represent changes in a score that have meaning for patients, have been suggested for the ADAS-cog (3 points in severe AD (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2011</LINK>)) and MMSE (1.4 points in mild AD (<LINK REF="REF-Schrag-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrag 2012</LINK>)). Comparing our findings with these we might conclude that the treatment effects for cognitive function are unlikely to be clinically relevant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>When taking capsules, a fairly lengthy titration period of up to 12 weeks is needed to develop tolerance and to minimize adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache and anorexia. The target was to treat patients with a maximum tolerated dose administered in two divided doses, the upper limit being 12 mg per day. There were significantly more total dropouts and dropouts due to adverse events from the 6 to 12 mg daily dose groups than from placebo groups and therefore adverse effects remain a clinical issue. There was no hepatotoxicity associated with rivastigmine and no statistically or clinically significant changes in vital signs.</P>
<P>The continuous dose patch was introduced to improve tolerability. One study (<LINK REF="STD-IDEAL" TYPE="STUDY">IDEAL</LINK>) tested two sizes of rivastigmine patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested in a 20 cm<SUP>2</SUP> patch (17.4 mg/day) and one 10 cm<SUP>2 </SUP>patch (9.5 mg/day), a dose similar to the usual oral dose. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2011</LINK>) tested 5 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (4.6 mg/day) and 10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (9.5 mg/day) patches. The smallest patch showed no treatment effect when compared with placebo for cognition, global function and activities of daily living. The efficacy of the 9.5 mg/day patch was comparable to that of the capsules with a similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. There was no difference in the number of withdrawals due to adverse events. Therefore, the 9.5 mg/day patch appears to have advantages compared with both the higher dose patches and the 6 to 12 mg/day capsules in terms of the overall incidence of adverse events, but it may not reduce the incidence of the more serious events that lead to cessation of treatment.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-21 04:06:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were able to include evidence from both published and unpublished trials in this systematic review. There were 3319 participants. Most participants were in industry sponsored trials. Data from two independent trials (n = 162) were not available and we excluded data from two other independent trials (n = 75) from our analyses because of concerns about risk of bias. The participants in the included trials had mainly mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. They were not highly selected with respect to their general health so that all but the seriously ill were included. Only two trials included patients with severe dementia, and we excluded the data from one of these leaving data on only 218 patients with severe dementia included in the analyses.</P>
<P>The main limitations in the completeness and applicability of the evidence were the lack of long term data beyond 26 weeks and the limited range of outcomes measured. Beyond 26 weeks, some trials continued as an open label, extension phase. There were very few data on outcomes important to patients and carers, such as quality of life.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-21 04:09:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence at 26 weeks is moderate for most outcomes. Our main concern for the evidence is that only seven studies have contributed data to the meta-analysis, and all of these studies were either industry sponsored or industry funded. In addition, withdrawals from these studies were of concern.</P>
<P>The results from <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK> nearly always showed greater benefits for rivastigmine on each outcome than demonstrated in <LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-B304" TYPE="STUDY">B304</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK> was responsible for the heterogeneity between trials that was reported for some of the measures of cognitive function. There are no obvious differences between <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK> and the other phase III trials. It was conducted only in the US, but so was <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>. The doses reached by patients in <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK> were higher than those of <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>, by 1.2 mg per day on average. Results from <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK> have been more extensively reported than the other three phase III trials but there is no reason to suppose that this trial is of any more importance in the overall assessment of rivastigmine. We have not downgraded the evidence based on this heterogeneity concern since the impact on the overall pooled results is small and does not change the interpretation of any of the results.</P>
<P>Outcomes such as behavioural symptoms and quality of life are important to patients but these were only reported by three studies and one study, respectively. Hence, the quality of evidence for these was lower.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-21 05:29:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial protocol of the review, which was published in 1998, had aimed to include all double-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of rivastigmine with a minimum study period of two weeks, regardless of the doses or formulations used. However, this resulted in a large number of possible comparisons. In addition, studies often used multiple instruments to report the same outcome, for example cognitive function was measured using the MMSE, ADAS-Cog and other tests. For some of these outcomes we decided to use only the most commonly used tests in the main analysis.</P>
<P>In this update we decided to concentrate on the currently recommended doses (6 and 12 mg/day for oral doses, and 9.5 mg/day for transdermal patches), and a minimum treatment duration of six months for the main analysis. We considered the decision to focus on longer term data was clinically sensible since a titration period was required to reach the target doses.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-21 05:46:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most patients from the four phase III trials continued in an open label phase for a further 26 weeks during which the maximum tolerated dose was administered. Results from these extension phases have been described as showing a possible beneficial effect of rivastigmine on disease progression (Product monograph, <LINK REF="REF-Novartis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novartis 1998</LINK>). Reported results showed that patients who had received placebo or rivastigmine 1 to 4 mg daily in the randomised phase showed initial improvement on the ADAS-Cog before declining at the same rate as the 6 to 12 mg daily group, although remaining more impaired by approximately 1.5 points. These results must be interpreted with caution. The randomised, double-blind conditions no longer prevailed. There had been differential dropout from the groups and there was no placebo group for the comparison. An imputed rate of decline for placebo patients was obtained by extrapolating from the randomised phase and not from actual observations.</P>
<P>There is much interest in the identification of patient characteristics that might predict a response to a cholinesterase inhibitor. <LINK REF="REF-Burns-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2004</LINK> reported that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective in patients with more severe disease. Data were pooled from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK>) for those with a baseline MMSE of 10, 11 or 12 (n = 117), in the group treated with rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day) or placebo, and the analysis showed that rivastigmine benefited those with more severe disease. This result has not added anything substantial to what was known already. The analysis of the total dataset from these trials demonstrated that rivastigmine was of benefit to the population randomised.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Erkinjuntti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkinjuntti 2002</LINK>, funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, investigated the response to rivastigmine of those without hypertension compared to those with using the data from <LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>. They reported that particular benefits may be observed in those with vascular risk factors. These results are based on retrospective analysis of the study data and there has been no study confirming this finding using prospective data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Farlow-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farlow 2003a</LINK> retrieved dropouts from the studies <LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK>. These patients stopped treatment before the end of the trials but were invited back for assessment at the endpoint. Farlow concluded that those who had been in the rivastigmine groups had deteriorated less than those from the placebo groups, and therefore rivastigmine had provided a beneficial delay in disease progression. The two groups cannot be compared. The participants belong to a highly selected group, those who stopped treatment and agreed to return. The placebo group was much smaller than the rivastigmine group (38 compared with 88). Those who left the trial from the placebo group may have done so because their illness was more severe. This may have applied to some of those in the rivastigmine group who left but, in addition, there were those who left because they suffered from adverse effects. It is not possible to compare these two groups in a meaningful way.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Grossberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossberg 2000</LINK> was a Novartis funded extension study examining the data from the four phase III studies and the related open label extension studies. Those who had been taking rivastigmine continuously for two years were compared with historical controls and the study concluded that rivastigmine has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance for up to two years in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These results must be treated with caution as the two groups are not comparable.</P>
<P>Several reviews of rivastigmine have been published. <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1998</LINK> both limited analysis and interpretation to the three trials <LINK REF="STD-B352" TYPE="STUDY">B352</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-B303_x002f_B305" TYPE="STUDY">B303/B305</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-B351" TYPE="STUDY">B351</LINK>. Spencer reported that "individual and pooled results indicate that rivastigmine usually produces cognitive, global and functional changes that indicate significantly less deterioration than was observed with placebo". Schneider reported that "the pooled analyses confirm the efficacy of rivastigmine in the treatment of both the cognitive and functional deficits of mild to moderately severe AD". <LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2002</LINK> was the report from NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence, UK) of the systematic review on which the decision was made that the cholinesterase inhibitors would be available on the National Health Service to treat those with Alzheimer's disease. <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK> was a review of all aspects of rivastigmine, and summarised the clinical trials but without meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hauber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauber 2000</LINK> calculated the potential savings costs using rivastigmine compared with no treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Hauber used a disease stage model. Results from two phase III trials of rivastigmine, together with extrapolation beyond the six month duration of the trial, identified the stage of disease using the MMSE assessments. Costs of healthcare resource use was estimated as a function of MMSE, using data from Canadian sources. Rivastigmine was judged to be cost effective due to the delay in disease progression. The analysis was repeated in a UK and US setting. These results are not based on randomised evidence and rest on many assumptions. It would be unwise to base decisions on whether rivastigmine should be prescribed to patients on the basis of cost-effectiveness studies such as these. <LINK REF="REF-Fillit-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fillit 2004</LINK> presents an excellent summary of the cost-effectiveness studies and of the assumptions on which they are based. Fillit concludes that the results from these studies are not reliable and that outcomes related to costs and healthcare resource use must be assessed in randomised clinical trials.</P>

<P>Use of rivastigmine in doses of 6 to 12 mg daily is associated with statistically significant benefits in terms of cognitive function. Benefits are also seen in the activities of daily living and clinician rated global impression scale ratings, which suggests that they may be of clinical as well as statistical significance. At lower doses (4 mg or less total daily dose) differences were in the same direction and were significant for cognitive function. Significant differences in the CIBIC-Plus were seen at 26 weeks but not earlier. The 10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (9.5 mg/day) patch has been tested in two placebo controlled trials and shows similar benefits to the 6 to 12 mg oral dose. One double-blind placebo controlled study of longer than 26 weeks is included in this review, but the data were not included in the meta-analyses due to concerns about the study. This present review has not examined economic data.</P>
<P>Side effects observed were predictably related to the cholinergic actions of the drug. They may be related to the pharmacokinetics of the drug and merit further study. Three sizes of transdermal patch have been tested in two trials, and there is evidence that the 9.5 mg/day patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patches and has comparable efficacy to all three.</P>
