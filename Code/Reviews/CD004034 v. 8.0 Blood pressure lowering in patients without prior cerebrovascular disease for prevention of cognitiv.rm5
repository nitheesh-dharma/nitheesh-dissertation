<P>Hypertension and cognitive impairment are prevalent in older people. We found four trials suitable for analysing the effectiveness of blood pressure lowering for preventing development of cognitive impairment and dementia. However, for several reasons, including the differing methodologies of the trials, the number of drop-outs from the trials, and active treatment of subjects in the control groups, we were unable to assess definitively the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatments for preventing cognitive impairment and dementia in people with no evidence of previous cerebrovascular disease.</P>

<P>This is an update of a previous review (<A HREF="McGuinness 2006">McGuinness 2006</A>).</P>
<P>Hypertension and cognitive impairment are prevalent in older people. Hypertension is a direct risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD) and recent studies have suggested hypertension impacts upon prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore does treatment of hypertension prevent cognitive decline?</P>

<P>To assess the effects of blood pressure lowering treatments for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in patients with hypertension but no history of cerebrovascular disease.</P>

<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as many trials databases and grey literature sources were searched on 13 February 2008 using the terms: hypertens$ OR anti-hypertens$.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in which pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions to lower blood pressure were given for at least six months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. The following outcomes were assessed: incidence of dementia, cognitive change from baseline, blood pressure level, incidence and severity of side effects and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-02 11:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>Four trials including 15,936 hypertensive subjects were identified. Average age was 75.4 years. Mean blood pressure at entry across the studies was 171/86 mmHg. The combined result of the four trials reporting incidence of dementia indicated no significant difference between treatment and placebo (236/7767 versus 259/7660, Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.74, 1.07) and there was considerable heterogeneity between the trials. The combined results from the three trials reporting change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) did not indicate a benefit from treatment (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) = 0.42, 95% CI 0.30, 0.53). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were reduced significantly in the three trials assessing this outcome (WMD = -10.22, 95% CI -10.78, -9.66 for systolic blood pressure, WMD = -4.28, 95% CI -4.58, -3.98 for diastolic blood pressure).<BR/>Three trials reported adverse effects requiring discontinuation of treatment and the combined results indicated no significant difference (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.92, 1.11). When analysed separately, however, more patients on placebo in Syst Eur 1997 were likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects; the converse was true in SHEP 1991. Quality of life data could not be analysed in the four studies.<BR/>Analysis of the included studies in this review was problematic as many of the control subjects received antihypertensive treatment because their blood pressures exceeded pre-set values. In most cases the study became a comparison between the study drug against a usual antihypertensive regimen.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-27 11:32:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>There is no convincing evidence from the trials identified that blood pressure lowering in late-life prevents the development of dementia or cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients with no apparent prior cerebrovascular disease. There were significant problems identified with analysing the data, however, due to the number of patients lost to follow-up and the number of placebo patients who received active treatment. This introduced bias. More robust results may be obtained by conducting a meta-analysis using individual patient data.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-27 11:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-McGuinness-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuinness 2006</LINK>) which found no convincing evidence that blood pressure lowering prevents the development of dementia or cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients with no apparent prior cerebrovascular disease.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 11:34:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>The relationship between blood pressure, cognition and dementia is complex and not fully established. Analysis of the epidemiological data must take account of the following methodological issues. Firstly, longitudinal studies can suggest whether a causal relationship exists between blood pressure and cognition or dementia, whereas cross-sectional studies can not determine causality. Secondly, the definitions of high or low blood pressure and cognitive impairment are heterogeneous across the studies and may limit comparability. The methods used to screen for and to examine in more detail cognitive impairment are also heterogeneous. The diagnosis of dementia, and its aetiology, does follow established, standardised criteria, however. Thirdly, studies may vary in controlling for the effect of other vascular risk factors or antihypertensive treatment, for example.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, analysis of the available epidemiological data does allow some conclusions to be drawn. The reader is referred to recent authoritative reviews including detailed analysis of the relevant literature which is beyond the scope of this updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennelly 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several longitudinal studies have reported a consistent relationship between elevated blood pressure in mid-life (age 40-64 years) and cognitive impairment in late-life (age &gt;65 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Elias-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elias 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Launer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Launer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilander-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kilander 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilander-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilander 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elias-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elias 2004</LINK>). This effect was more marked if the high blood pressure was not treated (<LINK REF="REF-Elias-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elias 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilander-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilander 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several of the same data sets also indicated a relationship between mid-life hypertension and the incidence of dementia and AD in late-life (<LINK REF="REF-Launer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Launer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kivipelto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kivipelto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitmer 2005</LINK>). In the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (<LINK REF="REF-Launer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Launer 2000</LINK>), this association was only present in those participants not treated with antihypertensive agents. One Japanese study reported a relationship of mid-life high blood pressure to late-life VaD but not to AD (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The available data regarding late-life blood pressure and cognition or dementia are inconsistent. Some studies showed no relationship between high blood pressure and cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tervo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tervo 2004</LINK>) or dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshitake-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshitake 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brayne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brayne 1998</LINK>). Other studies did find a relationship between late-life high blood pressure and cognitive decline (<LINK REF="REF-Elias-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elias 1993</LINK>) or dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Skoog-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Skoog 1996</LINK>). Low blood pressure in late-life has been more consistently associated with cognitive impairment and dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruitenberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruitenberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verghese-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verghese 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 11:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>Treatment of high blood pressure has been reported in several observational studies to be protective against cognitive impairment and dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-in_x0027_t-Veld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">in't Veld 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khachaturian-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khachaturian 2006</LINK>). Effective agents have included calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Yasar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasar 2005</LINK>) and diuretics (<LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khachaturian-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khachaturian 2006</LINK>). Other studies have reported no benefit of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2002</LINK>). These studies did not find a relationship between high blood pressure and incident dementia.</P>
<P>Evidence of the true effectiveness of treating high blood pressure on preventing cognitive impairment and dementia is needed from randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>Several RCTs which are ineligible for this review have investigated the effect on cognition of blood pressure lowering therapy. The reasons for exclusion of these studies from the current meta-analysis, according to the prespecified criteria in the Methods, may be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> section. The Hypertensive Old People in Edinburgh (HOPE) study showed that treatment of hypertension is not hazardous to cognitive function in older people with pre-existing cognitive impairment and that long-term adequate control of blood pressure may even reverse cognitive impairment associated with pre-existing hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Starr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Starr 1996</LINK>). The Medical Research Council trial (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 1996</LINK>) comparing the treatment of moderate hypertension with either hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride or atenolol found no effect on cognition over 54 months (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 1996a</LINK>). A brief trial comparing the angiotension receptor blocker valsartan and the ACE inhibitor enalapril showed that valsartan was more effective in lowering blood pressure and improving memory function (<LINK REF="REF-Fogari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fogari 2004</LINK>). In people with established cerebrovascular disease (and therefore excluded from the current meta-analysis), treatment with an ACE inhibitor based regime reduced the risk of dementia with recurrent stroke, the overall risk of cognitive decline and the risk of cognitive decline with recurrent stroke but not the overall risk of dementia in secondary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is scant evidence in the literature on the effects on cognition of non-pharmacological interventions which lower blood pressure. Such interventions might include salt restriction, weight reduction, exercise, and reduction in alcohol intake.</P>
<P>Recent hypertension treatment trials (<LINK REF="STD-ALLHAT-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ALLHAT 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASCOT-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ASCOT 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VALUE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">VALUE 2004</LINK>) did not report data on cognition or dementia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-26 12:02:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>The pathological processes through which hypertension might influence cognitive function are numerous. Cerebral ischaemia caused by atherosclerosis of large and small vessels, vascular smooth muscle hyperplasia, infarction, and altered cerebral blood flow are important factors and interact with other factors such as age, genetic predisposition, and smoking. Changes in cerebral white matter, or leukoaraiosis, can also occur as a result of sustained high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Starr-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starr 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-26 11:31:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effects of blood pressure lowering on development of cognitive decline and dementia in patients with hypertension but no history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). The effects of antihypertensive interventions for people with established cerebrovascular disease are the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ratnasabapathy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratnasabapathy 2003</LINK>). Given the burden of both hypertension and dementia, identification of treatments that reduce the rate of cognitive decline or incidence of dementia would be of considerable clinical, public health, and societal benefit.</P>
<P>This update is important to ensure that relevant data published since the first review are included in the meta-analysis, allowing the best possible estimate of the effect of blood pressure lowering on cognitive decline to be obtained.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:41:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>IDENTIFICATION OF STUDIES<BR/>The search and screening of publications was undertaken by two authors (BMcG, supported by ST). For this update, the search and screening of publications was undertaken by two authors (ST, supported by BMcG). The MeSH terms and search strategy used were agreed upon and tested by both reviewers. The other authors (PP and RB) acted as adjudicators and reviewed the process.</P>
<P>Authors independently selected trials for relevance against the defined inclusion criteria. Those trials that did not fulfil the criteria were excluded from further analysis. Excluded studies may be referred to in the discussion section.</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed with particular emphasis on the concealment of treatment allocation. Trials were ranked using the Cochrane approach (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):</P>
<P>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>This is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office, by phone to receive the treatment group allocation;<BR/>(ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy;<BR/>(iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administered sequentially to enrolled participants;<BR/>(iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or<BR/>(v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes;<BR/>(vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>This is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) use of a 'list' or 'table' to allocate assignments;<BR/>(ii) use of 'envelopes' or 'sealed envelopes';<BR/>(iii) stating the study as 'randomized' without further detail.</P>
<P>Grade C: Inadequate concealment<BR/>This is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) alternation;<BR/>(ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week, or any other approach;<BR/>(iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials were included if they conformed to category A and those falling into categories B or C were excluded.</P>
<P>Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow up.</P>
<P>INCLUSION CRITERIA<BR/>Identified trials with the above quality assessment were included. Any disagreement in the independent selection was resolved with discussion.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point was extracted.</P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data was sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data was sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial was sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The analysis would assess the effect of:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>All blood pressure lowering interventions</LI>
<LI>Combined effect of all antihypertensive medications</LI>
</UL>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation (SD)) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results was not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome was the weighted mean difference where the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation, where they used different rating scales or tests.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as dead or alive, development of dementia or no dementia, the odds ratio was used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the treatment effect across trials was calculated. Overall estimates of the treatment difference were presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model was presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic was performed. If there was significant heterogeneity a random effects model was presented.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the robustness of the results to fixed effect versus random effect models and on the inclusion or exclusion of studies of poor quality. If the treatment effect in the sensitivity analysis were of the similar magnitude and precision as that of the main analysis, a definite conclusion about the treatment effectiveness will be made; otherwise no definite conclusion will be made on the effectiveness of the treatment.</P>

</UL>
<P> Of the individual studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> reported significance with results indicating a benefit. There were 21 cases of incident dementia in the placebo group and 11 in the active treatment group. The number of patient years was 2737 and 2885 respectively. Active treatment reduced the rate of dementia by 50% (95% CI 0, 76) from 7.7 to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (p=0.05). However, when the numbers of subjects in the active treatment (1238) and control groups (1180) are considered, consistent with analysis of the other included studies, the benefit with active treatment is no longer significant (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24, 1.03) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> from 2365 patients in the active treatment group 1.6% (37) had a positive diagnosis of dementia and from 2371 patients in the control group 1.9% (44) had a positive diagnosis of dementia. There was no evidence that active treatment reduced the incidence of dementia (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.51, 1.31). In <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed dementia; 62 from 2477 patients in the candesartan arm and 57 from 2460 patients in the control arm (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.75, 1.56). In <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK> no significant difference in the rate of incident dementia was found, with 126 cases in the treatment group (1687 subjects) and 137 in the control group (1649 subjects) (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69, 1.15).</P>
<P> A sensitivity analysis was carried out with <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> removed (due to problems with the placebo group) and there was no difference in the incidence of dementia outcome.</P>
<P> To control for the possible effect of differential drop-out, an analysis was carried out to determine the incidence of dementia in the first year of study treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 12:19:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen Todd">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of blood pressure lowering on development of cognitive decline and dementia on patients with hypertension but no history of stroke or TIAs. There have been numerous RCTs assessing blood pressure lowering treatment but most did not assess cognitive function. There have also been numerous cross-sectional, longitudinal, and observational studies assessing relation of hypertension to subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. These were not included in the review as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are considered the gold standard.</P>
<P>A systematic review that included all population based studies relating to blood pressure and cognitive decline or dementia concluded that the studies provided substantial evidence of a risk effect of mid-life high blood pressure on the development of late-life cognitive decline and dementia, particularly if left untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2005</LINK>). There is no strong evidence from the longitudinal studies, however, to indicate that late-life hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. The authors summarized that the observational studies showed some beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment against cognitive decline and dementia in elderly people but that RCTs were necessary to verify these effects to take into account different antihypertensive agents and the extent of blood pressure reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the four RCTs identified which met the inclusion criteria, there is no convincing evidence that blood pressure lowering in late-life prevents the development of dementia or cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients without apparent prior cerebrovascular disease. <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> reported a benefit from treatment in prevention of dementia but neither <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK> showed a benefit and, when the trials were entered in a meta-analysis, no statistically significant effect was seen.</P>
<P>The secondary objectives of the review were difficult to meet. From the studies identified the optimal blood pressure level for prevention of dementia or cognitive decline could not be determined.<BR/>Nitrendipine, a calcium channel antagonist, was found to be effective in reducing incidence of dementia in <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>. The trialists felt it may have had a neuroprotective effect outside blood pressure lowering but further studies would be required to confirm this hypothesis. Without individual patient data (IPD), it is difficult to assess if there are different effects of treatment according to aspects of baseline risk such as sex, age, or blood pressure level.</P>
<P>Analysis of this data was problematic due to the number of patients lost to follow-up, with differential loss between the assigned groups, and the number of placebo patients who received active medication as their blood pressure exceeded certain pre-set values, thus introducing bias. The bias may be reduced by analysing one year data but true cognitive effects may not be seen over such a short time period. IPD would be required to be certain of outcomes in each study and there may be an advantage in extending length of follow-up to be certain of true incidence of cognitive decline. More detailed discussion addressing quality of the included studies is found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>However, examining the literature from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and observational studies along with the RCTs, there is moderately strong evidence to support the view that hypertension in mid-life, especially if not treated effectively, negatively affects cognition and contributes to the development of dementia and AD in later life (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2005</LINK>). It is proposed that high blood pressure in middle age can cause a long term cumulative effect, which leads to increased severity of atherosclerosis and more vascular comorbidities in later life. There is less evidence from these studies that the same negative effect on cognition is present for hypertension in late-life.</P>
<P>A number of other meta-analyses have been published since our initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birns-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birns 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK> reported a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and active controlled trials of the risks of stroke, stroke recurrence and dementia with blood pressure lowering therapy in participants both with and without evidence of prior cerebrovascular disease. Four trials were included in the prevention of dementia outcome (<LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>). Across the four trials, the pooled odds ratio was not significantly lower in the active treatment group (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.75, 1.04; p=0.15). A sensitivity analysis found a significant difference if only those studies initiating treatment with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or diuretic were considered (<LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> combination therapy subgroup) (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60, 0.94; p=0.01) whereas those studies initiating an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (<LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> perindopril only subgroup) did not have an effect on dementia (OR 1.08; 95%CI 0.84, 1.38; p=0.54). RCTs to determine if specific blood pressure lowering treatments have differing effects on the prevention of dementia were advised (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2005</LINK> included data from <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> as well as <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> in their aggregated data meta-analysis of the effects of blood pressure lowering treatment on dementia and/or cognitive decline in patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease. In <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> 'cardiovascular complications' were present in 29.9% of patients at randomisation. However, only 4.1% and 11.6%, respectively, had a history of stroke and myocardial infarction. <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> reported that at baseline 4.5% in the candesartan group and 4.6% in the control group had previous (longer than 6 months) myocardial infarction; the corresponding figures for previous stroke were 3.9% and 3.9%. In <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>, 4.9% of participants in both active treatment and control groups had history of myocardial infarction. History of stroke was present in 1.5% of the active treatment group and 1.3% of the control group. Thus, the majority of the participants in these three trials did not have cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> was a trial of blood pressure lowering therapy following stroke. Feigin and colleagues combined data on significant cognitive decline and dementia from <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>. Counting the majority of this trial's participants twice in their meta-analysis introduces bias. Feigin et al report a non-significant reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive decline with blood pressure lowering treatment (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63, 1.02) (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Birns and colleagues included RCTs measuring the effect of blood pressure reduction on any measure of cognitive performance (<LINK REF="REF-Birns-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birns 2006</LINK>). Trials were included in their meta-analysis that compared different antihypertensive treatments as well as placebo controlled trials. Additionally, the presence of cerebrovascular disease was not an exclusion criteria, in contrast to this Cochrane review. Analysis of incident dementia was not carried out. Outcomes were reported on measures of: global cognitive function (MMSE); memory (immediate and delayed logical memory); perceptual processing and executive function (digit span, trail-making, digit symbol substitution; and learning capacity (paired associate learning). In an analysis including <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK>, decrease in the MMSE score was 0.19 (95% CI 0.19, 0.19) points less in the active treatment group. <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> had a weight of 99.88% in that analysis. <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> could not be included in any analysis, as the authors note resulting in bias. It was concluded that antihypertensive treatment decreases decline in global cortical function and memory but may not have a similar effect on executive function or learning capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Birns-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birns 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2008</LINK> performed a meta-analysis including their trial (<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK>) along with three other placebo-controlled trials of antihypertensive treatment that assessed dementia incidence (<LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK>). The pooled relative risk was of borderline significance (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76,1.00; p=0.045). The results are similar to those of this updated Cochrane review (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). As previously noted, <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> was excluded from our review as it enrolled subjects with cerebrovascular disease. <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2003</LINK> provided the majority of the weight for the meta-analysis by Peters et al. which used a random effects model. As no significant heterogeneity was found in our analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), a fixed effects model was presented.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK>, with 40% Chinese participants, had more non-Caucasian participation than is reported or may be inferred from the geographic locations of the other included studies. The consistent results across the discussed meta-analyses suggests a common effect across populations.</P>
<P>Based on data provided by authors of included studies (<LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK>), an analysis was performed of incident dementia in the first year of follow up, assuming lower degree of differential dropout between the active treatment and control groups across that time period (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). No significant effect of active treatment was found (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.24, 2.16; p=0.56) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this update the values for <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> were amended to the number of subjects in each group rather than patient-years of follow up which previously had been used. This kept the denominator consistent across the included studies. This did not alter the point estimate of the effect of blood pressure lowering therapy on incidence of dementia.</P>
<P>It is also important to note that cardiovascular outcomes were the primary end-points in all of the included studies in this review. Dementia and cognitive function were secondary outcomes. The trials had to be terminated once the benefits for the primary end-points were shown. It is therefore possible that beneficial effects on cognition are not observed before the cardiovascular benefits become apparent. Following patients in placebo-controlled trials from mid-life would be very informative in terms of cognition but would not be ethical.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> it was speculated that dementia prevention was facilitated by a neuroprotective role of the calcium-channel blocker, nitrendipine. The meta-analysis by Wang and colleagues suggests differential effects between dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics on the one hand and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system on the other (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>). It would be informative to address this class effect further but again there are ethical considerations.</P>

<P>The addition of the <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK> trial to the updated meta-analysis does not alter the conclusions from the initial review, which remain that blood pressure lowering in late-life is not indicated with the aim of prevention of cognitive decline or dementia alone.</P>

<P>Recommendations arising from this review are:</P>
<P>1. Further analysis of the studies using IPD, although this would be time consuming and expensive. This would allow analysis of the data taking into account differential drop-out and may lead to more robust results.</P>
<P>2. Further trials on different classes of drugs. In <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> it was speculated that dementia prevention was facilitated by a neuroprotective role of the calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine. The meta-analysis by Wang and colleagues suggests differential effects between dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics on the one hand and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system on the other (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>). For ethical reasons further trials must be head to head, however, as placebo controlled trials could no longer be justified. Based on the epidemiological data (<LINK REF="REF-Qui-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 2005</LINK>), trials of blood pressure lowering treatment regimens should be designed to include subjects with hypertension in middle age with prolonged follow up and assessment of cognition into older age which are adequately powered to determine, as a primary outcome, whether cognitive impairment and dementia can be prevented.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-05-10 16:27:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analysed in the review: Blood pressure level.</P>
<P>Not analysed in the review: Total mortality; coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality; CHD morbidity and mortality (M&amp;M); cerebrovascular mortality; cerebrovascular M&amp;M; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular M&amp;M.</P>
<P>Dropouts due to side effects (no significant difference between groups): placebo: &lt; 7.3%; treatment: &lt; 7.8%.</P>
<P>Quality of life or functional status outcomes: Across 4 years of follow-up, patients receiving active treatment were more likely to report problems on the Social Interaction scale than placebo treated patients (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02, 1.69). There were no significant differences between active and placebo treatment in the other Sickness Impact Profile dimensions or in the measure of depression.</P>

</B>Large multicentre trial which mostly fits the inclusion criteria (1.4% reported history of stroke). It Included only patients with ISH (systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg, diastolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg) and age older than 60 years. There was no evidence that active treatment reduced the incidence of dementia. One problem identified was open label treatment was given if SBP &gt; 240 mmHg or DBP &gt; 115 mmHg at a single visit. As more people in the placebo group than in the treatment group needed open label treatment the imbalance may have biased the results. Analysing one year data may be more useful.</P>
<P>A follow-up study carried out by <LINK REF="REF-Di-Bari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Bari 2001</LINK> aimed to evaluate whether assessment of cognitive and functional outcomes was biased by differential dropout. Characteristics of subjects who did or did not participate in follow-up cognitive assessments were compared. The relative risk of incident cognitive impairment was assessed in the two groups, with the use of reported findings and under the assumption that the proportion of cognitive impairments among dropouts increased. Assignment to placebo group and the occurrence of cardiovascular events independently predicted missed assessments. When 20-30% of the subjects who missed the assessment were assumed to be cognitively impaired, assignment to active treatment reduced the risk of cognitive impairment. The authors concluded that in <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> the cognitive evaluations were biased toward the null effect by differential dropout. This might have obscured the appraisal of a protective effect of treatment on the incidence of cognitive decline in older hypertensive adults.</P>

<BR/>
</B>Large multicentre trial which mostly fulfilled the inclusion criteria (7.3% had prior cerebrovascular disease and 4.1% had a history of stroke). The trial was stopped early as the primary endpoint of a significant benefit for stroke was reached after the second interim analysis. The vascular dementia project study by intention-to-treat analysis found the incidence of dementia was reduced by 50%. There was difficulty analysing the trial as it was difficult to account for the progression of all people through the trial. It was not clear how many people reached endpoint in each year of follow up nor was it clear how the patients were followed up. More than 50% of the placebo group received active treatment i.e. an antihypertensive. It was difficult to interpret the results of the intention to treat analysis as it was difficult to ascertain who exactly was in each group; this includes results for change in BP, incidence of dementia and cognitive change. The results above should therefore be interpreted with caution because of the element of bias. Individual patient data (IPD) would be required to be certain of outcomes.</P>
<P>Substudy of <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Forette-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forette 2002</LINK>): this was an open-label, active treatment follow-up study in the same population based on the original active study medication. The median follow-up was 3.9 years. 80.5% of control patients ended up on active treatment due to blood pressure level. Throughout follow-up, systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 7.0/3.2 mmHg higher in the 1417 control patients than in the 1485 subjects randomized to active treatment. Compared with the controls, long-term antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of dementia by 55% from 7.4 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years (43 versus 21 cases, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant change in MMSE between control and active treatment groups. Again this follow-up study needs to be interpreted with caution as most of the control patients received antihypertensive medication and it was open label.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Large multicentre trial. The problem with interpreting the results of this trial is that only 16% of the patients in the control group received placebo alone; 84% received active antihypertensive treatment. The SCOPE trial was initiated as a placebo-controlled study. However, because of changes in treatment guidelines and for ethical reasons, it became necessary during the recruitment period to recommend open-label active antihypertensive therapy in both treatment groups for patients whose blood pressure remained high. As a result, the trial actually compared a candesartan-based regimen with a usual treatment regimen not containing candesartan. There was no significant difference found between the groups in terms of significant cognitive decline (reduction in MMSE of 4 points or more at two consecutive visits in comparison to baseline) or incidence of dementia but one would have to assume the control group had been compromised. It was also difficult to interpret values for mean reduction in BP and change in MMSE as it was not clear whether all subjects on open label treatment were included. One year data may be more useful.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was carried out with <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> removed (due to problems with the placebo group) and there was no difference in the incidence of dementia outcome (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68,1.03).</P>
<P>One substudy of <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> assessed outcomes in patients not receiving add-on therapy after randomization (<LINK REF="REF-Lithell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lithell 2004</LINK>). This was a <I>post hoc</I> analysis and so did not meet inclusion criteria for the review. It is, however, worthy of comment as it analysed patients who most closely reflected the original intention of the placebo controlled trial. Out of 4937 patients in <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK>, 2098 did not receive add-on therapy. Of these 1253 received candesartan 8-16 mg daily, and 845 received placebo. When these two groups were directly compared, there was no significant difference between the candesartan and placebo groups with respect to change in MMSE score or development of cognitive impairment or dementia. The study investigators felt the lack of beneficial effect of candesartan on cognitive outcomes may have been explained by the relatively short follow-up (median 3.6 years) and the rather small blood pressure differences between the groups (mean SBP at baseline for candesartan group 164.7 mmHg; placebo group 164.6 mmHg; mean DBP at baseline for candesartan group 90.5 mmHg; placebo group 90.4 mmHg). It was also felt patients in SCOPE had very good cognitive function at baseline and were therefore at low risk for marked impairment. This was also thought to limit the possibility of demonstrating a preventive effect. It may be useful, therefore, to follow patients in this trial over a longer period of time to assess whether there is any significant difference in cognitive impairment over time.</P>
<P>Another substudy of <LINK REF="STD-SCOPE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">SCOPE 2003</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Papademetriou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papademetriou 2004</LINK>) assessed elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) only. The original study looked at patients with essential hypertension. This means results can be compared with SHEP 1991 and Syst Eur 1997 as both these trials only included patients with ISH. A subgroup analysis of outcome results in SCOPE patients with ISH was carried out; this was retrospective so did not fit inclusion criteria for the meta analysis. From 4964 patients, 1518 met criteria for ISH (systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg). Average duration of follow-up was 3.6 years. 754 patients received candesartan and 764 received control medications, although again 82% of control patients received active therapy due to blood pressure level. In both groups SBP and DBP reductions were significant but there was no significant change in MMSE between the candesartan and control groups and no significant difference in incidence of dementia between the two groups. This substudy therefore showed candesartan to be effective in treatment of ISH in elderly patients like <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Syst-Eur-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Syst Eur 1997</LINK>, but showed no benefit in terms of protecting against cognitive decline. Again the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the number of control group patients on active treatment and short follow-up.</P>
<P>A further substudy (<LINK REF="REF-Degl_x0027_Innocenti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degl'Innocenti 2004</LINK>) looked at Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of patients in the SCOPE trial. This showed that HRQL in SCOPE patients was generally good at baseline and well preserved during follow-up in the presence of substantial blood pressure reductions in both groups. The conclusions were that there should be no reason to withhold modern antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients due to concerns for a negative effect on HRQL.</P>
<P>This update identified one further study (<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK>) which fulfilled the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK> was a well-conducted, international, multicentre trial which mostly fulfilled the inclusion criteria (6.7% of the active treatment group and 6.9% of the placebo group had history of stroke at baseline). The lack of definitive data advising on the treatment of hypertension in the included age group (80 years or older) probably reflects the adherence to assigned study treatment, with less than 1% of participants not taking one of the three steps of active treatment or matching placebo. The trial was stopped early, after a median follow up of 1.8 years, due to the finding of a significant reduction in the primary end-point, the rate of any stroke, in the active treatment group at a prespecified interim analysis. A secondary end-point, death from any cause, was also significantly lower in the active treatment group. The majority of subjects (&gt;95%) were recruited from eastern Europe and China.</P>
<P>The HYVET-COG substudy (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2008</LINK>) reported on the 3336 subjects from the total trial population of 3845 who attended for at least one follow-up assessment (1 year). The 509 participants who did not meet inclusion criteria for this substudy were comparable in baseline data to those included. Prevalent dementia or cognitive decline at baseline was not reported, although MMSE scores ranged from 15 to 30. There were 263 incident cases of dementia, which was much greater than for the other included studies and reflective of the older mean age of participants in this trial compared to the other included studies. No significant difference in the rate of incident dementia or incident cognitive decline was found.</P>
