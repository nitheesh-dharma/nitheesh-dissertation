<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the western world. It takes about 20 years to develop and cigarette smoking is a known cause. Most lung cancers are not found early in the development of the disease. Regular screening is offered to those considered to be at high risk of contracting the disease. Trials were made of early detection methods such as the testing of sputum, x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest to see whether they made a difference to the number of people who were treated by surgery and the number of people who died as a result of the disease. This review examined the evidence from nine trials (with a total of 453,965 participants) and found that early screening with chest X-ray or sputum testing does not reduce the number of people who die from lung cancer. Screening with low-dose chest CT was found in one large trial to reduce the number of people who die from lung cancer but this trial only included very high-risk smokers and ex-smokers. CT screening however is associated with a high number of false positive results and there are also some people who have lung cancer detected and treated but in whom this cancer may not have progressed to cause death in their lifetime, even in the absence of treatment (referred to as overdiagnosis). More research is needed about the relative harms and benefits of CT screening in individuals at lower risk for lung cancer.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included nine trials in the review (eight randomised controlled studies and one controlled trial) with a total of 453,965 subjects. In one large study that included both smokers and non-smokers comparing annual chest x-ray screening with usual care there was no reduction in lung cancer mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07). In a meta-analysis of studies comparing different frequencies of chest x-ray screening, frequent screening with chest x-rays was associated with an 11% relative increase in mortality from lung cancer compared with less frequent screening (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23); however several of the trials included in this meta-analysis had potential methodological weaknesses. We observed a non-statistically significant trend to reduced mortality from lung cancer when screening with chest x-ray and sputum cytology was compared with chest x-ray alone (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03). There was one large methodologically rigorous trial in high-risk smokers and ex-smokers (those aged 55 to 74 years with &#8805; 30 pack-years of smoking and who quit &#8804; 15 years prior to entry if ex-smokers) comparing annual low-dose CT screening with annual chest x-ray screening; in this study the relative risk of death from lung cancer was significantly reduced in the low-dose CT group (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.92).</P>

<P>The current evidence does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology. Annual low-dose CT screening is associated with a reduction in lung cancer mortality in high-risk smokers but further data are required on the cost effectiveness of screening and the relative harms and benefits of screening across a range of different risk groups and settings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Lung cancer is the commonest form of cancer and causes the most cancer-related death worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1995</LINK>). Lung cancer currently accounts for approximately 5.9% of all deaths in high-income countries and 2.4% of deaths globally, constituting a major public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). The incidence of lung cancer amongst men in Canada, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweeden, Denmark, Finland and Italy has fallen in the last few decades, but the rates in women have risen in these countries (<LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2008</LINK>). The highest incidence rate remains in the United States of America (USA) where the incidence in men has been falling since the mid-1980s and the epidemic in women reached a peak in the mid-1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Bailar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2008</LINK>). There has been only a minor improvement in five-year survival from lung cancer in the last few decades, despite modern therapeutics. The current five-year survival from lung cancer is 16% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2009</LINK>) and the case fatality rate is around 86% globally (<LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ries-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ries 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overwhelming majority of cases of lung cancer are attributable to cigarette-smoking, and thus primary prevention should continue to be a major focus of public health campaigns. However, such measures are likely to have only a limited impact on mortality in the short term because of a lag phase in the order of 20 years. Most cases of lung cancer present at an advanced stage, and previous studies have therefore investigated the role of screening for the detection of pre-clinical disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kubik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubik 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tockman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilde-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 1989</LINK>). Following a series of lung cancer screening trials conducted in the 1970s, it has generally been felt that early detection of lung cancer does not improve outcome, particularly disease-specific mortality (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 1989</LINK>). In these trials chest x-ray screening was used, with or without sputum cytology, and the majority focused on high-risk smokers only (<LINK REF="REF-Fontana-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontana 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kubik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubik 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>). The risk of lung cancer in smokers is dose-dependent and while it attenuates following cessation of smoking, the risk still remains greater than that of a non-smoker (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 1993</LINK>). In addition, other factors such as age at stopping smoking or coexisting airflow obstruction may affect the risk (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tockman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tockman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>In more recent years low-dose CT scanning has been demonstrated to be a more sensitive tool than chest radiography for the detection of early stage lung cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Henschke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henschke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaneko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaneko 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sone 1998</LINK>). The ability of low-dose CT scanning to detect lung cancer at an early and resectable stage, demonstrated in a large uncontrolled study (<LINK REF="STD-Henschke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Henschke 2006</LINK>), has led many experts to advocate widespread lung cancer screening with this technique. This study of over 30,000 at-risk individuals screened by CT scanning reported that 85% of lung cancers detected from screening were stage 1, and those that underwent surgical resection had an estimated 10-year survival rate of 92%. A number of other uncontrolled studies of low-dose spiral CT scanning have also been published, supporting the sensitivity of CT scanning (<LINK REF="STD-Diederich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Diederich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diederich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diederich 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henschke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Henschke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henschke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Henschke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nawa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sobue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sobue 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sone-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sone 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Swensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiitola-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tiitola 2002</LINK>). However promising these results appear to be, longer survival of a few is not necessarily equivalent to reduced mortality overall. Uncontrolled studies cannot establish the effectiveness of screening tools in improving survival because of screening biases such as lead-time and overdiagnosis, which combine to inflate any assessment of survival, making it an unreliable statistic to evaluate progress against cancer over time (<LINK REF="REF-Welch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2007</LINK>). A true evaluation of the value of screening must also determine the effects of the process on all participants. Overdiagnosis, in particular, a common adverse event of screening, leads to overtreatment, where people are being treated whose 'disease' may pose no threat (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2010</LINK>). The harms associated with overtreatment include morbidity and mortality from lung cancer resection (and, to a small but measurable degree, from the screening process itself) and the anxiety and distress associated with a lung cancer diagnosis. Overdiagnosis is a well-known adverse effect of screening, and was initially reported in early evaluations of the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>. The potential for overdiagnosis in CT scanning may be greater than with chest x-ray, as this screening tool has the ability to detect much smaller tumours than chest x-ray (<LINK REF="REF-Welch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bach-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bach 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to assess the evidence regarding the ability of various screening methods to reduce lung cancer mortality and to evaluate the possible harms and costs associated with screening. Another purpose is to seek consumer participation since consumers may provide a different perspective on those outcomes of importance to them. For example, despite guidelines which do not support regular screening with chest x-rays some consumers would choose to have an annual chest x-ray (<LINK REF="REF-Woo-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 1985</LINK>). The present systematic review is a major update of our original review first published in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 1999</LINK>) and updated in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2004</LINK>) and 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 1999</LINK>). We systematically searched MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012 Issue 5) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2012). The detailed search strategy for the 2012 update is outlined in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other searches</HEADING>
<P>We undertook handsearching of the journal <I>Lung Cancer</I> (1985 to December 2000), including abstracts from international lung cancer meetings. We searched the bibliographies of identified studies and narrative reviews for additional citations. We contacted authors of primary studies and experts in the field of lung cancer screening to determine whether they were aware of any additional relevant unpublished or published studies or works in progress.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>At least two independent authors (RM and either AL or DC) searched the titles and abstracts obtained from the initial electronic search for potentially relevant trials for full review. In the 2012 update the abstracts were searched by RM and AL. Initially we categorised studies into the following groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Included: RCT or CCT that met the described inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>') and those where it was impossible to tell from the abstract, title or MeSH headings; </LI>
<LI>Excluded: non-RCT or CCT, or subject not screening for lung cancer.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Two authors (RM and CS in the original review and RM and AL in the 2012 update) then assessed the full text of the retrieved studies to determine whether the study met the inclusion criteria. We measured agreement using simple consensus and kappa statistics. We resolved disagreement by adjudication of a third party or by consensus.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of Bias</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (RM and LI in the original review and RM and AL in the 2012 update) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>) to assess: allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and other potential sources of bias. Each of these domains was scored separately as low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias (insufficient information to make a judgement) or high risk of bias as outlined below:</P>
<P>(1) Generation of allocation sequence<BR/>For each included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:<BR/>&#8226; Low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>&#8226; High risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>&#8226; Unclear risk, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described or gave insufficient information.</P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment<BR/>For each included study we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>&#8226; Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation: consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>&#8226; High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>&#8226; Unclear risk, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described or gave insufficient information.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding or masking (checking for possible performance bias)<BR/>For each included study we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>&#8226; Low risk, high risk or unclear for participants;<BR/>&#8226; Low risk, high risk or unclear for personnel;<BR/>&#8226; Low risk, high risk or unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations)<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>&#8226; Low risk (any one of the following): No missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically-relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically-relevant impact on observed effect size; missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>&#8226; High risk (any one of the following): reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically-relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically-relevant bias in observed effect size; &#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.<BR/>
<BR/>&#8226; Unclear risk (any one of the following): insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of &#8216;Low risk&#8217; or &#8216;High risk&#8217; (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided); the study did not address this outcome.</P>
<P>(5) Free of other bias (bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table)<BR/>For each included study we described any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias (e.g. baseline imbalance, bias of the presentation data, etc.)<BR/>&#8226; Low risk of bias, the trial appears to be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias;<BR/>&#8226; Unclear risk, the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias;<BR/>&#8226; High risk of bias, there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias, e.g. no sample size calculation made, academic fraud, industry involvement, or extreme baseline imbalance.</P>
<P>We measured inter-author reliability using kappa and weighted kappa statistics. We resolved disagreement by adjudication of a third party or by consensus. Where possible we asked the authors of included studies to verify the assessments of study methodology.</P>
<P>One of the authors (RM) extracted data and entered these into the Review Manager 5 (RevMan) software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We asked authors of included studies to confirm the data extracted. However, authors from only one of the studies have confirmed our data extraction to date (<LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>). Where original data were not available it was necessary to extrapolate from graphs. A second study member (CS) extracted data for the main study results.</P>
<P>We combined outcomes from included trials using Review Manager 5. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We tested homogeneity of effects sizes between studies being pooled using a cut-off level of P &lt; 0.10 for statistical significance. For pooled analyses we also calculated the I² statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies caused by heterogeneity rather than sampling error; less than 25% was considered as low-level heterogeneity; 25% to 50% as moderate-level, and higher than 50% as high-level heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). For those outcomes where there was significant statistical heterogeneity, we reported risk ratios using the random-effects model. For other outcomes we used the fixed-effect model. We analysed data on an intention-to-screen basis.</P>
<P>We assessed the statistical significance of differences in the proportion of participants with particular baseline prognostic factors (between intervention and control groups) using Fisher's Exact test. For many of the studies, data were presented on multiple baseline variables and we used the conservative Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1995</LINK>). This defines significance as occurring when P is less than 0.05 divided by the number of comparisons.</P>
<P>In August 2003, this review was updated (search updated up to January 2003) (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2004</LINK>), with no new eligible studies identified. In May 2008, we updated this review again (search updated to November 2007) (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2010</LINK>), identifying no new trials, but one publication that reported on extended follow-up of the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> (Marcus 2006). In May 2012, we updated this review again (search to May 2012).

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2013-06-17 11:02:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>In the original review we found 1869 citations with the MEDLINE search, of which we selected 119 for full text-review (kappa = 0.54; moderate agreement). Following the full-text review, we selected six studies (all with multiple citations) for inclusion in the review (kappa = 0.9; very good agreement). We selected a further study for inclusion after searching bibliographies of review articles. Searches of EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, handsearching of <I>Lung Cancer</I> and contact with primary authors and experts in the field did not reveal any further relevant studies that had not been identified by the MEDLINE search. Of the 119 citations selected for full-text review, 39 citations were relevant for inclusion, 52 citations described uncontrolled or non-experimental studies, four were case-control studies and 24 were narrative reviews or commentaries. We identified no additional eligible studies by the updated search of MEDLINE in January 2003. We identified one study which published extended follow-up of the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> (16 additional years) in the updated search in 2007 (Marcus 2006), but found no other new randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>For the 2012 update we identified two new trials for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>). An additional three randomised controlled trials of CT screening were excluded at this stage in keeping with our review protocol, because the duration of follow-up was less than five years (<LINK REF="STD-DANTE" TYPE="STUDY">DANTE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DLCST" TYPE="STUDY">DLCST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MILD" TYPE="STUDY">MILD</LINK>). These trials are described in more detail in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table. In the <LINK REF="STD-DANTE" TYPE="STUDY">DANTE</LINK> trial only 6.5% of participants had five years or more of follow-up, while in the <LINK REF="STD-MILD" TYPE="STUDY">MILD</LINK> study the median follow-up was 4.4 years and in the <LINK REF="STD-DLCST" TYPE="STUDY">DLCST</LINK> 4.81 years. A further two randomised controlled trials of CT screening were excluded because they were feasibility studies that did not include mortality as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Depiscan-Group" TYPE="STUDY">Depiscan Group</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2008</LINK>). Three ongoing trials which are yet to publish mortality data were identified and are described in the ongoing trial section (<LINK REF="STD-ITALUNG" TYPE="STUDY">ITALUNG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LUSI" TYPE="STUDY">LUSI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK>). A further publication identified was a combined mortality analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>) that were included in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Doria_x002d_Rose-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doria-Rose 2009</LINK>). Details of the excluded studies are outlined in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>In the original review we identified seven controlled trials of screening strategies for lung cancer. Six of these studies were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK> ). One study was a controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>). In all these studies, participants in the control groups underwent variable degrees of screening. Further details are outlined in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK> all men (aged 40 to 65) in 10 districts of Erfurt County were offered screening with chest x-ray at intervals of one to two years (control group), and the intervention group consisted of all men in four additional districts of Erfurt County who were offered screening with chest x-ray at six-monthly intervals. Screening took place between 1972 and 1977.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, industrial firms (mainly factories) were stratified by type of work and area and randomised into two groups. There were 75 firms in the intervention group and 44 in the control group. Male volunteers (aged 40 years or older) from firms in the intervention group were offered screening with chest x-ray at six-monthly intervals for three years. The control group were offered chest x-ray screening only at the beginning and end of the study. Screening took place between 1960 and 1964. There were no apparent occupational hazards in the industrial firms where the subjects were employed that might be expected to increase the risk of lung cancer, but none of the reports included the details of occupational exposures.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> had an unusual design. Male smokers (aged 40 to 64 years) were selected from the general population and initially all underwent a prevalence screen. Those without evidence of lung cancer at baseline were then randomised into two groups. The intervention group received semi-annual chest x-ray (postero-anterior view only) and sputum cytology for three years, while the control group were only offered screening at the end of the first three years with chest x-ray and sputum cytology. Subsequently, both the control and intervention groups underwent screening with annual chest x-ray (but not cytology) for a further three years (years four to six). The study began in 1976.</P>
<P>In the Kaiser Permanente Multiphasic Evaluation Study (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>), members (men and women aged 35 to 54) of the Kaiser Permanente medical care programme were randomised into two groups. The intervention group were urged to undergo an annual multiphasic health check-up (MHC). Members of the control group were not urged to undergo MHCs, but were free to arrange their own MHCs as part of the care provided by the Kaiser Permanente medical care programme. Spirometry and chest radiography were among the screening tests offered as part of the multiphasic health check-up. The study took place between 1964 and 1980.</P>
<P>Three other studies were carried out by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, 10,933 Mayo Clinic outpatients (male smokers aged 45 years and over) underwent a prevalence screen for lung cancer with chest x-ray and sputum cytology. The chest x-ray was postero-anterior initially, then both postero-anterior and lateral views were undertaken. Individuals who tested negative for lung cancer, with an adequate life expectancy (at least five years) and respiratory reserve, were invited to take part in a randomised study. A total of 9211 men took part in the randomised study. The intervention group were offered screening with chest x-ray and sputum cytology at four-monthly intervals for six years. The control group, on enrolment into the trial, received the Mayo Clinic standard 1970 recommendation to undergo an annual chest x-ray and sputum cytology test, but were not offered active screening or reminded to undergo screening during the study. Recruitment took place between 1971 and 1976. The Johns Hopkins Lung Project (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Study (<LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>) were both designed to assess whether sputum cytology at four-monthly intervals would improve lung cancer mortality when added to screening with annual chest x-ray. Male smokers (aged 45 years and over) were recruited through various publicity techniques and direct mail to health insurance prescribers and motor vehicle license holders. There were approximately 10,000 participants in each study. The intervention and control groups were both offered annual screening with chest x-ray (postero-anterior and lateral views); the intervention group were also offered sputum cytology three times a year.</P>
<P>In all these studies, lung cancer mortality was reported as an outcome. Many of them reported multiple outcomes, including lung cancer survival and resection rates.</P>
<P>In 2012 two more randomised controlled trials were included in the review after we conducted an updated search. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was a large NCI-sponsored randomised controlled trial conducted across ten sites in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>). In this two-arm randomised trial participants were randomised to a screening group which were referred for multiple screening tests for lung and colon cancer and either ovarian or prostate cancer (depending on gender). The control group were not offered screening. The lung cancer screening component consisted of an annual chest x-ray for four years (including the baseline test). There were a total of 154,934 participants, aged 55 to 74 years including both smokers and non-smokers. The National Lung Screening Trial was also funded by the National Cancer Institute in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>). In this multicentre randomised controlled study 53,454 current or former smokers aged 55 to 74 years were randomised to receive three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view postero-anterior chest x-ray.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We assessed risk of bias in all included studies according to the 'Risk of bias' tool described in the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>. 'Risk of bias' tables are provided for each study in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Judgements about the risk of bias are also summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> (risk of bias graph) and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> (risk of bias summary).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was judged as adequate in three out of nine studies, suggesting a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>). Concealment of allocation was inadequate in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>. Allocation concealment was unclear in four of the randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>). However, this is likely to be less important in a cluster-randomised study such as the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>. One study was a non-randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sequence generation was judged as adequate in seven out of nine studies, suggesting a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>). Patient record numbers (with a concealed code) were used to randomise participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>, and this method is generally considered inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). One study was non-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the potential for inadequate concealment of allocation to bias the results of randomised studies, we further examined the comparability of baseline data between randomised groups for each of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In general, these data were poorly reported. In fact, continuous variables such as age, means and standard deviations were not reported (only the proportion of participants within various age strata was reported). The details of smoking history by screening allocation were poorly reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, there were statistically significant differences in some baseline variables in two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>). While these differences may occur due to chance, they are more likely to occur if the randomisation process is inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, the proportion of ex-smokers was greater in the control group (18.8% versus 19.6%, P = 0.02) and the proportion of participants aged 60 to 64 years was greater in the intervention group (8.8% versus 8.2%, P = 0.01). The proportion of people over the age of 70 was also greater in the intervention group (0.5% versus 0.2%, P = 0.0003). Using a significance level of P &lt; 0.005 to allow for the multiple comparisons, the difference in the proportion of those aged 70 or more remains significant. Although these differences would not appear to be clinically significant, they raise the possibility that the randomisation process was inadequate. Differences in baseline variables might be expected to occur more often in cluster-randomised studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK> a chart review of clinical records was undertaken in a large subset of study and control group participants and this highlighted statistically significant differences in multiple baseline variables. For example, the racial composition differed significantly between the groups (29.3% versus 21.7%, P = 0.001), there were more participants in the intervention group with respiratory disease other than pneumonia, acute bronchitis or chronic lung disease (38% versus 33%, P = 0.03) and the proportion of participants with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia was significantly greater in the control group (18.5% versus 24.5%, P = 0.006; 3.8% versus 6.9%, P = 0.01 respectively). Allowing for multiple comparisons and using a P &lt; 0.0025, the differences in racial composition remain significant. These results are consistent with the inadequate randomisation process used in this study. In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> randomisation was stratified by age, smoking status, socioeconomic status, place of residence and occupational exposure. The number of strata used was not specified. However, where a large number of strata are used imbalances for prognostic variables can occur between study groups as a result of incomplete filling of permuted blocks within strata (<LINK REF="REF-Kernan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernan 1999</LINK>). The intervention and control groups appear to have been well matched for the stratified variables at baseline, but details were not provided for all variables in the published reports. For example, average lifetime cigarette consumption was greater in the intervention group than in the control group (266,334 versus 263,046). This difference was apparently not significant, but standard deviations and statistical tests were not reported (<LINK REF="REF-Kubik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubik 1986</LINK>). Of note, all-cause mortality was greater in the intervention group (P = 0.04) and the number of smoking-related deaths was also greater in the intervention group (P = 0.02).</P>
<P>Intervention and control groups were well matched on reported baseline characteristics in the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>.</P>

<P>Withdrawals and drop-outs were adequately described in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> ). In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, however, losses to follow-up were significantly greater in the control group (4.9% versus 3.6%, P = 0.0001); drop-outs were described as people who had moved from the area or refused 'medical control'. Follow-up was poor in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>. In 1980 only 64% of participants were still health plan members and the response rate to follow-up surveys was only 75%. Follow-up was not adequately reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, 1.3% of participants were lost to follow-up, however no further details were provided (<LINK REF="REF-Tockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tockman 1986</LINK>). Prolonged follow-up was reported for the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>. For years 7 to 15 of the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, lung cancer mortality was recorded but the methods and details were not described. The authors did note that eight of the participants diagnosed with lung cancer during the initial six years of the study were lost to follow-up. Losses to follow-up by screening allocation were not described. At the end of 1996 the vital status of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> was assessed. For those in whom it was not known from the Mayo Clinic records, vital status was ascertained by searching the National Death Index. Follow-up was similar in both groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>This was not a prespecified quality criterion. However, in several of the studies the statistical analysis was inappropriate. For example, stratification was not taken into account in the analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK> was not analysed using methods recommended for the analysis of cluster-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kerry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peto-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1976</LINK>). It is unlikely, however, that the findings of these studies would be altered substantially by such analyses.</P>

<P>For the purposes of analysis we grouped the studies into three categories. Firstly, those that compared more intense chest x-ray screening and/or sputum cytology with less intense screening with chest x-ray and/or sputum cytology; secondly, those that compared chest x-ray screening with usual care (no screening); and finally, studies of CT screening.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">More intense chest x-ray screening (and/or sputum cytology) compared with less intense chest x-ray screening (and/or sputum cytology)</HEADING>
<P>There were five studies that effectively compared more frequent chest x-ray screening (plus or minus sputum cytology) with less frequent chest x-ray screening, and four provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. We included the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK> in this category because the majority of participants in the control group underwent some screening during the study period. In the pooled analysis the risk ratio (RR) of death from lung cancer was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.31, fixed-effect model) and there was no significant statistical heterogeneity between the results of the different studies (P = 0.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1). When data from the prolonged follow-up reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> were included in the analysis, mortality from lung cancer was actually significantly greater in the group undergoing more frequent chest x-ray screening compared with the group receiving less frequent screening (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23, P = 0.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1). In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, (which could not be included in the meta-analysis due to insufficient raw data) lung cancer mortality was 0.6% per year in the control group and 0.8% per year in the intervention group during the six years of the study and there was reportedly no statistical difference.</P>
<P>Two studies compared annual chest x-ray screening with annual chest x-ray screening plus four-monthly sputum cytology, and these were pooled separately (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>). In this pooled analysis there was a trend to a reduction in deaths from lung cancer in the intervention group, but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2).</P>
<P>The key findings for this category are further summarised in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We proposed other subgroup analyses prior to undertaking the review. However, there were insufficient studies to examine the influence of age, sex and smoking history on the outcome. We had also planned to undertake sensitivity analyses based on trial quality. However, except for the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, all of the studies included in the original review had potential methodological weaknesses. Using different methods of meta-analysis did not substantially alter the results. For all outcomes the random-effects and fixed-effect models produced results which were not significantly different.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> is the only chest x-ray screening study that included a control group that were not offered any screening. After six years of follow-up the risk ratio of death from lung cancer in the screened group was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.03); after 13 years of follow-up the risk ratio of death from lung cancer in the screened group was 0.99 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.07).

<P>Four out of the five studies that effectively compared more frequent chest x-ray screening (plus or minus sputum cytology) with less frequent chest x-ray screening provided sufficient data for on all-cause mortality for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>) and one study did not report all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>). In the pooled analysis the risk ratio of death from all causes was 1.01 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.08, random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.1). There was significant statistical heterogeneity in the results P = 0.08 (using a threshold value for significance of P &lt; 0.10). Visual inspection of the graph for overlap of the 95% confidence intervals suggests that the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> differ from the other studies and, after removal of this study from the analysis, the risk ratio was 0.97 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.01, fixed-effect model) and there was no significant statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.47, I² drops from 56% to 0%). Of the two studies comparing annual chest x-ray screening plus four-monthly sputum cytology with annual chest x-ray screening alone, the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> did not report all-cause mortality, and in the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study there was no difference in all-cause mortality between the screening groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.15).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Compliance with screening and contamination in the control group</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, compliance with scheduled screening averaged 75% in the intervention group. Of the control group, 73% received chest x-rays during the final two years of the study. In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, both intervention and control groups were screened at the end of the third year. In the intervention group, 63.2% of workers attended for a final chest x-ray and 62.7% in the control group. None of the firms in the control group underwent mass radiography examinations during the three-year period.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, compliance with scheduled screening was not described in detail. In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, both the intervention and control group underwent screening at the end of the third year, with 92% of the intervention group and 95% of the control group attending. The proportion of participants in the control group who underwent screening outside the study was not reported but only one asymptomatic case was detected by a non-study x-ray in the control group.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, participants were considered compliant if they had their last x-ray in 1982, more than five years after enrolment or within one year of death (Melamed 1984). Of the intervention (dual screen) group, 63% were compliant, as were 65% of the control group. There was no comment about the proportion of participants in the control group who underwent screening with sputum cytology. In the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> 19% of participants withdrew from active screening but the proportion by screening group was not described (<LINK REF="REF-Tockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tockman 1986</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK> the mean number of multiphasic health check-ups (MHCs) per person during the study period was 6.8 (maximum 18, median 6) in the intervention group and 2.8 (maximum 17, median 1) in the control group. In the intervention group, 15.7% received no MHCs, compared with 36.2% of the control group.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> adherence to screening across the three rounds was 95% in the low-dose CT group and 93% in the chest x-ray group. Amongst participants in the chest x-ray group the average annual rate of helical CT screening during the screening phase of the trial was estimated to be 4.3%.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> adherence to screening was 86.6% at the baseline screen, falling to 79% by year three, with an overall adherence rate of 83.5%. Ninety-one point two per cent of participants underwent at least one radiographic screening. In the usual care group (not offered screening) the rate of chest radiograph screening was estimated at 11% during the screening phase of the trial. Of those with a positive screen for cancer at baseline, 82% were known to have had diagnostic follow-up, while between 93% and 95% of those who had a positive screening test on subsequent screening rounds were known to have had diagnostic follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number of cases of lung cancer detected</HEADING>
<P>Prevalence and incidence data were not reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, prevalent cases were not included in the study populations. In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, both prevalent and incident cases were included.</P>
<P>In those studies examining chest x-ray screening at different frequencies, there was a tendency for increased incidence of cancer in the intervention group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, the risk ratio of lung cancer was 1.33 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.75) in the intervention group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, the risk ratio was 1.28 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.57). After 16 additional years of follow-up, the risk ratio was similar (1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.30). In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, the risk ratio was 1.16 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.51). In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, the risk ratio was 1.38 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.57). The increased incidence of lung cancer in the intervention group is consistent with overdiagnosis bias, but it might also occur if the groups were not comparable at baseline with respect to important risk factors. It is generally believed that the radiation exposure associated with chest radiography in these studies would be insufficient to substantially increase the incidence of lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Diederich-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diederich 2000b</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, there were no significant differences in the number of cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the intervention and control groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.24; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.14, respectively). In the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> there was no significant difference between the number of cases of lung cancer diagnosed between the intervention and control groups (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.12) after 13 years of follow-up post-randomisation. In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> the number of cases of lung cancer diagnosed was significantly greater in the group offered low-dose CT screening compared with those offered screening with chest x-ray (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23) The results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Survival</HEADING>
<P>We examined survival by comparing the proportion of participants alive five years after diagnosis. There was a trend to improved survival in the intervention group in all the studies apart from the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> (survival for all participants diagnosed with lung cancer during the entire six years of the study). In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, the trend to improved survival did not reach statistical significance but in the remaining studies the differences in survival were statistically significant. In the pooled analysis of studies comparing more frequent chest x-ray screening with less frequent chest x-ray screening the risk ratio was 0.91 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.99, random effects model). There was significant statistical heterogeneity in the results (P=0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 68%). (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Visual inspection of the graph for overlap of the 95% confidence intervals suggests that the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> differs from the other results and, after removal of this study from the analysis, the risk ratio was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, fixed effects model) and there was no significant statistical heterogeneity (P=0.47 and I<SUP>2 </SUP>drops from 68% to 0%). Five-year survival data were presented for the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study as a combined analysis already in the literature (Fleihinger 1994).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stage distribution</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, stage distribution was reported for the resected patients only. Information about stage at diagnosis was not provided in the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>.</P>
<P>Because of the potential for overdiagnosis bias in the screened group, there may be an increase in the number of early stage cancers detected by screening, regardless of the efficacy of the intervention. If a screening programme is effective, then there should also be a corresponding reduction in the number of people presenting with advanced disease in the screened group. During the first three years of the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, 54% of lung cancers in the intervention group were diagnosed stage I or II, compared with 21% of cancers in the control group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, the proportion of early-stage cancers (stages 0, I or II) was greater in the intervention group: 99/206 compared with 51/160 (P = 0.002). However, there was no reduction in the absolute number presenting with advanced disease (stages III and IV): 107 cases in the intervention group and 109 in the control group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, the proportion of early-stage cancers detected was similar in the intervention and control groups: 58/143 versus 68/154; 83/194 versus 93/202 respectively. When assessing the stage distribution it is important to evaluate both the proportion of early- and late-stage cancers.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>, 39.5% (574/1454) of cancers in the intervention group were stage I or II compared with 35% (479/1378) in the control group (P = 0.01). However the absolute number of stage III and IV cancers were similar between the groups with 359 stage III and 514 stage IV in the intervention group and 365 stage III and 530 stage IV in the control group. In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> 57% (593/1040) of cancers were stage I or II in the low-dose CT (intervention) group compared with 39% (363/929) in the plain chest x-ray (control) group (P = 0.0001). In addition there was a significant reduction in the absolute number of cancers presenting as stage III and IV in the low-dose CT group compared with the chest x-ray group (447 vs 566, P = 0.0002; the denominator for this calculation was the total number of participants in each group).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Resection rates</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> (prior to screening at the end of the 3rd year), the resection rate was 25% in the intervention group and 16% in the control group (P = 0.33). By the end of the six years, the resection rates were the same in both groups (23%). In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, the resection rate for all cases diagnosed during the study was 46% in the intervention group and 38% in the control group (P = 0.27). In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, the resection rate was 46% in the intervention group and 32% in the control group (P &lt; 0.01). In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, the resection rate was 28% in the intervention group and 18.7% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, the resection rates were similar in the intervention and control groups: 51% and 53% respectively. In the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, the resection rate was 53% in the intervention group and 44% in the control group (P = 0.12). Resection rates were not reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>.</P>
<P>Of note in the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> was that a number of participants with potentially resectable lung cancer did not undergo surgery because they either declined it or were otherwise medically unfit. In fact, the proportion of participants with potentially resectable cancers who underwent surgery during the first three years of the study was significantly greater in the control group compared with the intervention group; 91% versus 50% (P = 0.04).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>, 60.6% of those diagnosed with cancer in the low-dose CT group underwent surgery (either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) compared with 44.1% in the chest x-ray group. In the low-dose CT group 44.6% of participants diagnosed with cancer were treated with surgery alone, compared with 26.8% in the chest x-ray screening group. In the low-dose CT group there were 12 participants with stage I or II cancer who did not receive any treatment, compared with 13 participants in the chest x-ray group. In the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> 34.3% of participants diagnosed with lung cancer in the chest x-ray screening group underwent surgical resection (with or without chemotherapy) compared with 30.1% in the usual care group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Postoperative deaths and harm associated with screening</HEADING>
<P>In general, harms associated with screening were poorly reported. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, postoperative deaths were reported in the participants diagnosed with lung cancer. There were four such deaths in the intervention group and five in the control group, which were counted as lung cancer deaths (Melamed 1984). In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, there were seven postoperative deaths in the intervention group and six in the control group. These were included in the lung cancer mortality data. In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, postoperative mortality within the first 30 days was three out of 33 resected cases of screen-detected cancer and one out of 11 resected cases of non-screen-detected cancer. In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, the postoperative mortality was 2.9% (three people) in the intervention group and 4.0% (five people) in the control group (P = 0.7). Postoperative deaths were not reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>.</P>
<P>For some of the studies, information was provided on the number of participants with abnormal screen results (refer to section on test performance). For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> of the 10,362 prevalence screens, there were 1574 participants with initially abnormal results. A large proportion of these were resolved by further radiographic evaluation. In general, the proportion of people requiring invasive diagnostic work-ups, including procedures such as bronchoscopy or biopsies, was not systematically reported. Of note, from the prevalence screens in all three National Cancer Institute (NCI) studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK>) of over 20,000 men, there were six postoperative deaths in people with lung cancer and two in people without lung cancer(<LINK REF="REF-Bailar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailar 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> there were a total of 18,146 positive test results in the low-dose CT group over the three annual screening rounds. Complete diagnostic follow-up information was available for 17,702, and amongst this subgroup there were 245 reports of at least one complication and 1075 invasive procedures performed (including 457 for investigation of abnormalities that did not turn out to be lung cancer). There were 84 major complications in individuals who underwent an invasive procedure (including 11 in individuals who did not have lung cancer). Invasive procedures included thoracotomy or thoracoscopy or mediastinoscopy or bronchoscopy or needle biopsy. In the low-dose CT group there were 16 participants who died within 60 days of an invasive procedure (10 of whom had lung cancer); it was not known if the procedures caused the deaths.</P>
<P>In the chest radiography group of the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> there were a total of 5043 positive test results and complete diagnostic information was available for 4953 of these. Amongst this subgroup there were 81 reports of at least one complication and 334 invasive procedures were performed (including 70 for investigation of abnormalities that did not turn out to be lung cancer). There were 24 major complications in individuals who underwent an invasive procedure (including one individual who did not turn out to have lung cancer). There were 10 deaths reported within 60 days of an invasive procedure (all in individuals with lung cancer).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> data on postoperative deaths were not reported and information about diagnostic procedures was not available for the usual care group. In the group offered screening the authors reported a complication rate of 0.4% amongst participants having a diagnostic follow-up procedure (the total number of participants with complications was 54). The most common complications were pneumothorax (29%), atelectasis (15%) and infection (10%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Test performance</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies was able to assess sensitivity and specificity accurately since there is no 'gold standard' which can be applied to all participants at the time of testing.</P>
<P>Some of the studies provided data on the proportion of total lung cancer cases detected by screening. In the <LINK REF="STD-North-London-Study" TYPE="STUDY">North London Study</LINK>, 73% of cancers in the intervention group were detected by screening compared with 38% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> (prior to screening in both groups at the end of the third year) none of the cases in the control group were diagnosed by screening, while 72% of those in the screened group were detected by screening (P &lt; 0.001). By the end of six years, however, the proportion of lung cancers detected by screening was not significantly different; 56% in the intervention group and 46% in the control group (P = 0.17), consistent with the fact that screening took place in both groups during years three to six of the study.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, 75% of cancers in the intervention group were detected by screening, including some non-study x-rays, and 26% of cancers in the control group were detected by non-study x-rays (P &lt; 0.001). By the end of the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, 69% of cancers were detected by screening in the intervention group and 61% by screening in the control group (P = 0.14). In the intervention (dual screen) group, cytology detected 29% of lung cancer cases and x-ray detected 51% of cancers. Both screening methods detected 10%. In the <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> 67% of cancers were detected by screening in the intervention group and 62% by screening in the control group (P = 0.3). Of note, there were significantly more squamous cell carcinomas detected in the intervention group (37% versus 25%, P = 0.026). Sputum cytology was good at detecting squamous cell carcinoma but relatively poor at detecting adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated large-cell carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Erfurt-County-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Erfurt County Study</LINK>, 47% of cancers were detected by screening in the intervention group compared with 27% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). The proportion detected by screening was not presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-Foundation-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser Foundation Study</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data were published on the positive predictive value of prevalence screens only for the three NCI studies and the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>. In the NCI studies chest x-rays were initially classified as negative for cancer, indeterminate, or suspicious for cancer. For x-rays classified as suspicious or indeterminate, the positive predictive values were 16%, 4.4% and 3.8% in the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study respectively. Considering only those classified as suspicious for cancer, the positive predictive values were 41%, 60% and 53% respectively. Sputum cytology results were classified as carcinoma cells, marked atypia, moderate atypia, slight atypia or normal. For cytology results classified as carcinoma cells, marked atypia and moderate atypia, the positive predictive values were 60%, 11% and 34% for the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johns-Hopkins-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Johns Hopkins Study</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study respectively. For cytology results classified as carcinoma cells or marked atypia, the positive predictive values were 75%, 64% and 68% respectively.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK>, from the prevalence screen of 6364 there were 232 abnormal x-rays and 17 cases of lung cancer (positive predictive value = 7.3%). During subsequent screening in the control group there were 166 abnormal chest x-rays and 25 lung cancer cases diagnosed (positive predictive value = 15%) (<LINK REF="REF-Kubik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubik 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>, of the 109 cancers detected (up to 1982) in the dual screen group, 64% were visible on earlier x-rays after retrospective review. Some of these were visible on x-rays taken up to 53 months prior to the diagnosis (Muhm 1983). In a similar review of cases diagnosed during the <LINK REF="STD-Mem-Sloan_x002d_Kettering" TYPE="STUDY">Mem Sloan-Kettering</LINK> study, 23% of interval cases of non-small cell lung cancer were visible in retrospect and 65% of screen-detected cases were also visible on previous x-rays (mean size 1.3 cm for retrospective films).</P>
<P>False positive rates were high in the low-dose CT group in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>, across the three screening rounds False positive rates were 96.4% of the positive results in the low-dose CT group and 94.5% of those in the radiography group. False positives were more common during the first two rounds of screening. Over the three rounds of screening the total number of low-dose CT screenings tests classified as positive was 24.2%, and 23.3% had false positive results. In the radiography group, 6.9% of screening tests were classified as positive (over the three screening rounds) and 6.5% had false positive results.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> lung cancer was diagnosed in 1060 participants in the group offered low-dose CT screening. In 649 participants it was diagnosed after a positive screening test and in 44 it was diagnosed after a negative screening test. In 367 it was diagnosed either after the screening phase had finished or in those who were due for a screening test or were never screened. In the chest radiography screening group of the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> 279 lung cancers were diagnosed after a positive screening test, 137 were diagnosed after a negative screening test and 525 were diagnosed either during the post-screening phase of the trial or in those who were never screened or were due for their next screening test.</P>

<P>Most studies reported that participants were advised to stop smoking but there were no specific smoking cessation strategies employed. In the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> smoking histories recorded during the study period showed no differences in terms of the proportions who stopped smoking or switched to pipes or cigars. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> at the end of one year of follow-up 90% of participants were still smoking or had resumed smoking, but figures were not reported by screening allocation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Consumer perspectives</HEADING>
<P>Those consumers most likely to be affected by the results of the review are healthy current or ex-smokers. Other high-risk groups include those with chronic obstructive airways disease and those who have previously been treated for lung cancer. We asked consumers or consumer advocates to participate in the review process, and consulted a consumer at the time of writing of the review protocol. This consumer was interviewed about the language of the review and the outcomes being considered. He identified some additional outcomes of relevance to consumers, including what the impact of screening would be on smoking behaviour and quality of life, and we incorporated these outcomes into the review. Another consumer (consumer advocate) was asked to evaluate the full review. After reading the review she was interviewed using a semi-structured format to identify issues of concern to consumers. We sought comments on the process of screening, the importance of various outcomes and the language of the review. From the point of view of consumers of screening services, she suggested that it would be important to be able to evaluate the burden of involvement in regular screening. She felt that many consumers "would not want to be living their lives around it". The studies in this review did not comprehensively outline the potential time commitments or inconveniences to consumers, nor did they evaluate the potential psychosocial effects of screening. It is not clear, for example, what proportion of people with abnormal results required more frequent monitoring or invasive procedures. She also suggested that there is likely to be a diversity of attitudes to screening in the community. If the natural history of lung cancer is not altered by screening then some people may think there is still merit in undergoing screening, while others would not want early diagnosis just for the sake of knowing.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-17 11:02:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This is a major update of the systematic review of lung cancer screening first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 1999</LINK>) and updated in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2004</LINK>) and 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Manser-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manser 2010</LINK>). The conclusions of the current review have been changed by the inclusion of two recently published substantial trials (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK>). In the original review, a meta-analysis of chest x-ray screening studies found that overall more frequent chest x-ray screening does not result in reduced lung cancer mortality compared with less frequent screening. In fact, when data from the prolonged periods of follow-up reported for the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Czech-Study" TYPE="STUDY">Czech Study</LINK> were included in the analysis, more frequent chest x-ray screening was associated with an 11% relative increase in lung cancer mortality compared with less frequent screening. Survival as an outcome in screening studies will be influenced by screening biases, including overdiagnosis, lead-time and length-time (for prevalent cases). The finding in this review of a significant increase in survival from lung cancer in association with an increase in disease-specific mortality emphasises the unreliability of survival as an outcome measure in screening trials. Screening which includes four-monthly sputum cytology in addition to an annual chest x-ray was not associated with an improvement in lung cancer mortality compared with annual chest x-ray screening alone. However the 95% confidence intervals are relatively wide and include a range of potentially clinically significant values (for example, the true effect might lie between a 26% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 3% relative increase in lung cancer mortality). The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> included in the present review is the only chest x-ray screening trial that included women and non-smokers in addition to smokers. It is also the only trial that had a control group that was not offered any form of screening. The finding in the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> of a lack of any reduction in mortality from lung cancer associated with chest x-ray screening is consistent with the results of earlier chest x-ray screening trials included in our original review. Importantly however, this was a methodologically rigorous trial and they did not find any increase in mortality associated with chest x-ray screening. We identified methodological weaknesses in most of the trials included in the original review. In particular the adequacy of allocation concealment was unclear in many of the studies. As has been reported by others recently, it is probable that a volunteer effect in the setting of a compromised randomisation process may account for the increased mortality from lung cancer noted in the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK> intervention group (<LINK REF="REF-Dominion-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dominion 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> comparing low-dose CT screening with chest x-ray screening support the finding of earlier uncontrolled CT trials which have consistently demonstrated that CT screening is more sensitive than chest x-ray screening. This methodologically rigorous trial shows that in current and ex-smokers (at least 30 pack-years) who have quit within the last 15 years and are aged between 55 and 74 years, CT screening is associated with a relative reduction of 20% in lung cancer mortality compared with chest x-ray screening. The lack of any harm or benefit from annual chest x-ray screening found in the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO Trial</LINK> suggests that we can be more confident about the relative benefit of CT screening in high-risk smokers compared with current usual care. It is not clear, however, whether the results of the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> will be generalisable to other populations. There are several smaller randomised trials that are currently ongoing in Europe, and these may add to our understanding of the applicability of CT screening in different settings (<LINK REF="STD-DANTE" TYPE="STUDY">DANTE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DLCST" TYPE="STUDY">DLCST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ITALUNG" TYPE="STUDY">ITALUNG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LUSI" TYPE="STUDY">LUSI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MILD" TYPE="STUDY">MILD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK>). Unlike the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> the majority of European studies have a control group that was not offered any screening and have offered a longer duration of screening in the intervention group. In addition they have included participants with a lower total tobacco exposure, and the <LINK REF="STD-LUSI" TYPE="STUDY">LUSI</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK> trials have used population-based methods to recruit participants. These studies are also likely to add to our knowledge of nodule management (<LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK>). Several of the European studies have published preliminary mortality data; however, we have excluded these studies from the present review because the duration of follow-up was not sufficient. We specified in our exclusion criteria that studies with follow-up of less than five years would be excluded, and we have therefore excluded <LINK REF="STD-DANTE" TYPE="STUDY">DANTE</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DLCST" TYPE="STUDY">DLCST</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-MILD" TYPE="STUDY">MILD</LINK>. Our review will be updated in future to include such studies once more follow-up data become available.</P>
<P>Although there is now some evidence to support the effectiveness of low-dose CT screening in individuals at high risk for lung cancer, there are several issues that need to be addressed in deciding the role of low-dose CT screening in current clinical practice and how these findings should influence current public health policy. The false positive rates of CT screening are high (approximately three to four times that seen with chest radiography screening in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>) and while the number of invasive tests performed for investigation of benign lesions was relatively low in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>, the majority of false positives results will lead to more frequent follow-up CT scans and hence additional costs and radiation exposure. The most important radiation-related hazard from low-dose CT screening in the population likely to be screened is radiation-induced lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 2004</LINK>). The estimated risk from a single CT screening examination is relatively small (&lt; 0.06%) but for annual screening in a current male smoker aged 50 to 75 it is estimated that screening could lead to a 1.5% increase in the risk of lung cancer, and for a female smoker it is estimated that screening could lead to a 5% increase in risk if screening were offered between the ages of 50 and 75 (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 2004</LINK>). It is also possible that screening conducted outside the trial setting may be associated with higher rates of invasive testing or complications if conducted by institutions or radiologists and clinicians with less experience in managing pulmonary nodules and lung cancers than those involved in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>. None of the studies included in this review have reported on costs or cost effectiveness to date. The <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> investigators are planning to report on quality of life effects, costs and cost effectiveness of screening in their trial, and to use modelling (in collaboration with the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network) to examine the impact that different variables may have on cost effectiveness and outcomes. Based on previous cost-effectiveness analyses however, even if screening is effective in groups at lower risk for lung cancer than those in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> it is unlikely to be cost-effective in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadevia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadevia 2003</LINK>). Many smokers and ex-smokers at risk for lung cancer are likely to fall into a lower-risk group for lung cancer than those in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>. If public health agencies recommend screening only in heavy smokers then consumers may well perceive this as inequitable. <LINK REF="REF-Ma-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2013</LINK> recently estimated that 8.6 million Americans met the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> criteria for lung cancer screening in 2010 and that if screening were offered to this eligible population then 12,000 deaths could be averted each year; however this represents just 7.6% of the total number of lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. The authors did not comment about the number of former smokers or current smokers who would be ineligible for screening, but in the 2008 to 2010 National Health Interview Survey 15.8% of the population in the United States were daily current smokers, 4.4% were non-daily current smokers and 21% were former smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Schoenborn-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoenborn 2013</LINK>). In a recent report on a surgical cohort of people with lung cancer it was shown that approximately 60% had stopped smoking more than 10 years ago and approximately 39% had stopped more than 20 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Mong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mong 2011</LINK>). Offering screening to lower-risk groups such as those who quit more than 15 years ago or those in a younger age group might be seen as a way to increase the impact of screening at a population level, but as previously indicated this is not likely to be a cost-effective strategy within the current CT screening paradigm (<LINK REF="REF-Mahadevia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahadevia 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Models that examine the cost effectiveness of low-dose CT screening need to take into account the impact of overdiagnosis by screening, but this may be difficult to estimate. The proportion of cancers 'overdiagnosed' by screening can be estimated by examining the difference in incidence between the intervention and control group in screening studies. At the end of screening it is expected that the incidence of cancer will be higher in the screened group as screening advances the time of diagnosis; however, with a period of follow-up after the cessation of screening the magnitude of this difference is likely to fall as some previously undiagnosed but clinically significant cancers are diagnosed in the control group due to the presence of symptoms or signs. If there is a persistent excess of cancers in the intervention group years after screening has ceased this is likely to represent the proportion of overdiagnosed cases. The optimal duration of follow-up post-screening is not clear, but ideally would include the lead-time of the slowest growing tumours, although competing mortality risk is also an important factor (<LINK REF="REF-Welch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2007</LINK>). Some experts have estimated overdiagnosis with chest x-ray screening to be as high as 50% using data from the <LINK REF="STD-Mayo-Lung-Project" TYPE="STUDY">Mayo Lung Project</LINK>. However, given that there are doubts about the adequacy of the randomisation process in that study, this may not be a reliable estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Dominion-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dominion 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2007</LINK>). The only other randomised trial included in this review that showed a statistically significant difference in incidence between intervention and control groups was the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In this trial there was at least five years of follow-up after the end of screening, at which time there had been 1060 lung cancers diagnosed in the CT screening group compared with 941 in the chest x-ray group (an excess of 119 cases). Of note, there were 95 screen-detected cases of bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma in the CT screening group compared with only 13 in the chest x-ray group (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>). The term bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma is no longer recommended and it is likely that most of these tumours would fall into the category of either adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive or lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma according to current pathological criteria (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Travis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2011</LINK>). Adenocarcinoma in situ refers to lesions that are 3 cm in size or less and have a purely lepidic growth pattern. Observational studies have shown that these lesions are associated with 100% disease-free survival after complete resection and therefore could potentially be overdiagnosed by screening (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2011</LINK>). However, these pre-invasive lesions may also progress over time to become invasive and therefore longer periods of follow-up will be needed in randomised controlled trial of screening to determine the magnitude of overdiagnosis and the potential impact of screening on these more indolent tumours. The true rate of overdiagnosis by CT screening may not be accurately assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> because the control group were offered chest x-ray screening which is also likely to overdiagnose some cases of lung cancer, albeit to a lesser extent. Of the randomised controlled trials of low-dose CT scanning currently underway in Europe, the <LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK> trial will provide valuable data about overdiagnosis, as the investigators are planning 10 years of follow-up and the control group have not been offered any screening. Screening studies have provided valuable insights into the clinical, radiological and pathological features of adenocarcinoma in situ and other pre-invasive lesions and these data has been used to develop new recommendations for the management of such lesions that aim to minimise the extent of invasive procedures and may reduce the impact of overdiagnosis in screening trials (<LINK REF="REF-Godoy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godoy 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-17 11:00:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The current evidence suggests that screening with annual plain chest radiography in smokers and non-smokers, and more frequent chest radiography screening in smokers and ex-smokers, is not effective at reducing lung cancer mortality and cannot be recommended for clinical practice. Annual screening with low-dose CT scanning was associated with a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality in one large study of high-risk individuals (aged 55 to 74 years with 30 pack-years or more of smoking, or who quit 15 years or less prior to entry if ex-smokers); however, more data are needed on the cost effectiveness of screening that takes into account the frequency of screening and both the benefits and harms (such as false positives and overdiagnosis) before recommendations can be made for large-scale screening programmes. In the interim, physicians should discuss the relative risks and benefits of screening with people at high risk for lung cancer before recommending screening, and should ensure that any screening and subsequent management of abnormal results takes place in a healthcare setting with adequate experience in managing pulmonary nodules and lung cancer. Further studies are needed before recommendations can be made about screening individuals at lower risk for lung cancer, such as non-smokers or those with less than 30 pack-years of smoking exposure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The current low-dose CT screening trials underway in Europe will provide further data on the generalisability of the results of the <LINK REF="STD-North-American-NLST" TYPE="STUDY">North American NLST</LINK> conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-DANTE" TYPE="STUDY">DANTE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DLCST" TYPE="STUDY">DLCST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ITALUNG" TYPE="STUDY">ITALUNG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LUSI" TYPE="STUDY">LUSI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MILD" TYPE="STUDY">MILD</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NELSON-2003" TYPE="STUDY">NELSON 2003</LINK>). These studies will also provide further insights into factors such as the frequency of screening, nodule management strategies and the rates of overdiagnosis. However, it is likely that the poor specificity of CT screening will remain a major barrier to the implementation of screening in clinical practice and public health screening programmes. Future research should focus on developing strategies to target CT screening at very high-risk populations by taking into account not only smoking status but the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and other clinical factors (<LINK REF="REF-Raji-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raji 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2008</LINK>). Models incorporating age, smoking status, genetic factors and spirometric data are currently being developed (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2012</LINK>). In addition the development of biomarkers may further help to refine populations at highest risk using samples such as blood, exhaled human breath or sputum (<LINK REF="REF-Boshuizen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boshuizen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carpagnano-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpagnano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Machado-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machado 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhong-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhong 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Men (59%) and women aged between 55 and 74, with a history of cigarette-smoking of at least 30 pack-years and if former smokers had quit within the previous 15 years.</P>
<P>Individuals were excluded with a previous diagnosis of lung cancer, or who had undergone CT chest within 18 months before enrolment, or with a history of haemoptysis or unexplained weight loss of more than 6.8 kg in the preceding year.</P>
<P>53,454 persons were enrolled, 26,722 were assigned to screening with low-dose CT and 26,732 to screening with chest radiography.</P>
<P>Participants were recruited by the 33 screening centres. At each screening centre participants were made aware of the trial through direct mailing and use of local radio, newspaper advertisements, outreach including health fairs and presentations to unions an community groups, National Cancer Institute and institutional websites, Internet-based advertising and public service television and radio announcements.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-17 10:58:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The intervention group were offered a total of three screenings with low-dose CT at yearly intervals. The control group were offered a total of three screenings with chest radiography (postero-anterior projection) at yearly intervals.</P>
<P>All low-dose CT scans were acquired using multidetector scanners with a minimum of four channels. The acquisition variables were chosen to reduce exposure to an average effective dose of 1.5 mSv. Low-dose CT scans that revealed any non-calcified nodule measuring at least 4 mm in any diameter and radiographic images that revealed any noncalcified nodule or mass were classified as positive "suspicious for" lung cancer. Other abnormalities such as adenopathy or effusion could also be classified as positive. At the third screening round abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer that were stable across the three rounds could be classified as minor abnormalities rather than positive results. No specific nodule-evaluation approach was mandated by the trial protocol and the recommendations of the interpreting radiologist were reported in writing to the participant and his or her healthcare provider within four weeks of the examination.</P>

<P>The intervention group were offered a single-view posterioranterior chest x-ray at baseline and then annually for three years (a total of four screens including the baseline x-ray). A chest x-ray was considered positive when a radiologist identified a mass (&gt; 3 cm), nodule(&lt; 3 cm), infiltrate, or any other abnormality considered suspicious for cancer. Never-smokers randomised after April 1995 were not offered the final screen. The control group were assigned to usual care (no formalised screening). Participants who received a positive screening result were referred to their primary healthcare provider for further evaluation. The trial protocol did not specify a diagnostic algorithm. Chest radiographic screening in the usual-care group was assessed by surveying a random sample of just more than 1% of participants using biennial and later annual health status questionnaires.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>There were initially 10,933 men interviewed and entered in the prevalence phase of the study. Randomisation for the incidence phase of the study took place on entry to the prevalence study but 16% of men were excluded after randomisation. The exclusions included 91 prevalent lung cancers, six upper respiratory tract cancers, 971 who were ineligible because their life expectancy was less than five years or were thought unable to tolerate lobectomy, and 653 participants who did not complete the prevalence screening. Clinical judgements about eligibility were made by clinicians independent of the study, but the screening group allocation was marked on the participant's record on enrolment and therefore clinicians would have been aware of the allocation at the time of assessing eligibility. Randomisation was undertaken by staff interviewers (not primary investigators) on site, using a random number table, but it is unclear whether or not this was concealed or open (personal communication with Dr Fontana).</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Death certificates were obtained for participants who were known to have died. An end point verification team determined whether the cause of death was lung cancer. Deaths selected for review included those with a notation of lung cancer on the death certificate and those occurring among participants ever diagnosed with lung cancer, as well as deaths within six months of a screen suspicious for lung cancer and deaths within 60 days of certain diagnostic evaluation procedures associated with a screen suspicious for lung cancer or a lung cancer diagnosis. Members of the end point verification team were not aware of group assignments. A distinction was made between a death due to lung cancer and a death that resulted from the diagnostic evaluation for or treatment of lung cancer; however the deaths in the latter category were counted as lung cancer deaths in the primary end point analysis.</P>
