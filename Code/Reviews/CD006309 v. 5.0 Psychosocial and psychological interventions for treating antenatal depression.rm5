<P>Not enough evidence to say if non-drug interventions are effective in treating antenatal depression.</P>
<P>Although for many women pregnancy was once thought of as a time of emotional wellbeing, approximately 12% of women will suffer from antenatal depression. Research suggests that women who are on low-income, lack social support, experience significant stress or negative life events, and have poor relationships may be at higher risk of developing antenatal depression.<BR/>Unfortunately, depression during the pregnancy is related to poor maternal self-care behaviours, which may influence the baby's health, and it places a woman at significant risk of developing postpartum depression. Many women are unwilling to take medication during their pregnancy and are often interested in psychosocial and psychological interventions as a form of treatment. The review found only one trial involving 50 US women evaluating interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of antenatal depression. This trial provided insufficient evidence to determine if psychological therapies are effective treatment for antenatal depression. Further research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although pregnancy was once thought of as a time of emotional wellbeing for many women, conferring 'protection' against psychiatric disorders, a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies suggests the mean prevalence rate for depression across the antenatal period is 10.7%, ranging from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.8% in the second trimester. Due to maternal treatment preferences and potential concerns about fetal and infant health outcomes, non-pharmacological treatment options are needed. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects, on mothers and their families, of psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum care in the treatment of antenatal depression. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-04-08 14:04:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Trials Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) (July 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 3<I>), </I>MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1980 to July 2006) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2006). We also scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field to identify other published or unpublished trials. </P>
<P>We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 31 March 2010 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials of preventive psychosocial or psychological interventions in which the primary or secondary aim is to treat antenatal depression. We excluded quasi-randomised trials (for example, those randomised by delivery date, or odd versus even medical record numbers) from the analysis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All review authors participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction. Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for continuous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One US trial was included in this review, incorporating 38 outpatient antenatal women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV criteria for major depression. Interpersonal psychotherapy, compared to a parenting education program, was associated with a reduction in the risk of depressive symptomatology immediately post-treatment using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (one trial, n = 38; relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.83) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (one trial, n = 38; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03). </P>

<P>The evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of antenatal depression. The one trial included was too small, with a non-generalisable sample, to make any recommendations.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-08 14:16:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Mental illness is a major public health concern. According to the World Health Organization, by the year 2020 depression will be second only to coronary heart disease in disability experienced worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). Two large-scale community-based surveys of psychiatric disorders in the United States have confirmed that the lifetime rate of major depression in women is 1.70 to 2.70 times higher than in men (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1993</LINK>), and it peaks in prevalence during a woman's childbearing years (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1994</LINK>). Although pregnancy is a time of emotional wellbeing for many women, conferring 'protection' against psychiatric disorders, a recent meta-analysis of 21 studies suggests the mean prevalence rate of depression across the antenatal period is 10.70%, ranging from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.80% in the second trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004a</LINK>). These studies were conducted in both developed and developing countries.</P>
<P>More than 20 studies have reported on demographic and psychosocial variables associated with antenatal depression. Although the methodological quality of these studies is variable, some consistent associations have been reported. In particular, lack of social support, both in general and from the partner, has been strongly associated with antenatal depression in numerous studies (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Barnet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pajulo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pajulo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubertsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubertsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seguin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seguin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zayas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zayas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelkowitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelkowitz 2004</LINK>), as have stressful or negative life events (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Barnet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blaney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubertsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubertsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seguin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seguin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zayas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zayas 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, conflict with the partner/infant's father or poor relationship status have been associated with antenatal depression in four studies (<LINK REF="REF-Barnet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelkowitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelkowitz 2004</LINK>). Unlike studies of postpartum depression, which have found very strong associations between depressive symptoms and personal psychiatric history, previous psychiatric history has been associated with antenatal depression in only one study (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2003</LINK>), and not associated with depression in four other studies that have included this variable (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Da_x002d_Silva-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da-Silva 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Honjo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honjo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seguin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seguin 1995</LINK>). Among obstetric variables, past pregnancy complications or caesarean delivery have been associated with antenatal depression in three studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fatoye-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatoye 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubertsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubertsson 2003</LINK>), while complications in the index pregnancy are not consistently associated with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Blaney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Da-Costa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Costa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pajulo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pajulo 2001</LINK>). Of demographic variables, only lower income has been repeatedly associated with antenatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Blaney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pajulo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pajulo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seguin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seguin 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>A depressive episode during pregnancy increases the risk for poor self-care, which may compromise the health of the developing fetus (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara--1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1983</LINK>). Depressed women may also be at increased risk for preterm deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Steer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1992</LINK>). In addition, uncontrolled depression during pregnancy significantly increases the risk for postpartum depression (a well-documented condition that may lead to negative consequences for the mother, child and family). For example, in a UK study of 417 pregnant women, 9.8% experienced depressive symptoms in the third trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Johanson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanson 2000</LINK>). At 12 weeks postpartum, 22.60% of women who were depressed postnatally were also depressed antenatally. In a similar study of 1489 pregnant Swedish women, 17% had depressive symptoms in the third trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Josefsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Josefsson 2001</LINK>). Following women postnatally, 45% of women who experienced postpartum depression were also depressed antenatally.</P>
<P>While depression is amenable to treatment, unique issues arise for those experiencing antenatal depression. One such issue is the use of antidepressant medication. In a US sample of 210 pregnant women who had a history of major depression prior to pregnancy and were currently or recently (less than 12 weeks prior to last menstrual period) receiving antidepressant treatment, 86 (43%) experienced a relapse of major depression during pregnancy. Among the 82 women who maintained their medication throughout their pregnancy, 21 (26%) relapsed compared with 44 (68%) of the 65 women who discontinued medication (<LINK REF="REF-Cohn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohn 2006</LINK>). These results suggest that women who discontinued antidepressant medication relapsed significantly more frequently over the course of their pregnancy compared with women who maintained their medication. However, if pharmacotherapy is considered during pregnancy, the risk to the mother and fetus of antidepressant medication discontinuation and subsequent depression must be carefully weighed against the risk of antidepressant medication use during pregnancy. Although evidence exists that antidepressant medication may be safe for use antenatally (<I>see</I> Motherisk website: www.motherisk.org/index.jsp), many depressed pregnant women are adverse to taking antidepressants, and non-pharmacological treatment options are desired. Among those suggested as effective treatment for general depression are: </P>
<UL>
<LI>psychosocial interventions, such as diverse supportive interactions including support groups; </LI>
<LI>psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (a treatment that assists the individual in identifying and correcting erroneous beliefs and systematic distortions in information processing with the hopes of reducing distress and enhancing coping efforts); and </LI>
<LI>interpersonal psychotherapy (a treatment where the connection between depressive symptomatology onset and interpersonal problems is used as a focus). </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>A Cochrane systematic review evaluating these interventions for the treatment of postpartum depression is available (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2006</LINK>). Based on the preceding risk factors outlined, a variety of psychosocial and psychological interventions have also been suggested for the treatment of antenatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Nonacs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nonacs 2002</LINK>). This review examines the effectiveness of psychosocial and psychological interventions in the treatment of antenatal depression where treatment is defined as any intervention initiated amongst pregnant women who have been identified with depressive symptomatology.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We would have used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. If heterogeneity was found this would have been explored by sensitivity analysis followed by random-effects if required. For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we used the weighted mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We would have used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but use different methods. If there was evidence of skewness, this would have been reported. Trials using different treatment strategies would have been analysed separately and the results combined only if there was no reason to think that they differed in relevant ways. While the primary meta-analysis was based on the occurrence of depression or not (however measured by trialists), we would have incorporated several depression rating scales or cut-off points.</P>

If ICCs from other sources are used, this was be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identified both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we planned to synthesise the relevant information. We would have considered it reasonable to combine the results from both if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely. We would also have acknowledged heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and performed a separate meta-analysis. Therefore the meta-analysis would have been performed in two parts as well.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>It is remarkable that only one psychological or psychosocial trial of antenatal depression was of adequate quality to be included in this review. At least four of the excluded trials tested biologically-oriented interventions. Psychological and psychosocial trials are particularly needed for antenatal depression as a result of potential or perceived concerns associated with the use of antidepressant mediations, and possibly other biological interventions, during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2005</LINK>). Data indicate that a majority of women prefer psychological or psychosocial interventions over antidepressant medications to treat depression during pregnancy or the postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Buist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buist 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chabrol-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chabrol 2004</LINK>). Besides immediate improvement in depressive symptoms, psychological and psychosocial interventions for depression during pregnancy may have additional benefits. In particular, research in the general depressed population suggests that psychotherapy interventions may have longer lasting effects than antidepressant medications (<LINK REF="REF-Hensley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hensley 2004</LINK>). The skills acquired as a result of these therapeutic interventions may be highly applicable in the postpartum period, perhaps resulting in the prevention of depression during the postpartum period or a future time. Also, many psychological and psychosocial interventions involve mobilisation of support resources, such as a partner or other network members. There is ample evidence to indicate that lack of social support is a strong risk factor for depression during both pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Adewuya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adewuya 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2004</LINK>) and the postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2004</LINK>), suggesting that this mobilisation of support resources may be a particularly valuable component of treatment at this time.</P>
<P>Although several trials have been conducted to test the prevention of postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2004</LINK>), it is notable that antenatal depression is common, and perhaps more prevalent than postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004a</LINK>). Furthermore, research indicates that for many women, antenatal depression continues into the postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>), leaving the woman and her child at risk for the negative outcomes associated with both antenatal (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004b</LINK>) and postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 2003</LINK>). As such, it is critically important to develop treatments that are effective during the antenatal period.</P>
<P>The only trial included in this review tested the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for the treatment of depressed pregnant women. This pilot study of 38 predominantly impoverished US women found that 16 45-minute sessions of IPT delivered by a trained therapist were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. IPT has previously been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Klier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klier 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 1995</LINK>). The effectiveness of IPT in perinatal populations makes theoretical sense (<LINK REF="REF-Grigoriadis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigoriadis 2006</LINK>). A course of IPT typically involves one of four foci (<LINK REF="REF-Klerman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerman 1984</LINK>), of which role transition is particularly relevant in the perinatal period due to the many adaptations required by women during this period (<LINK REF="REF-Stuart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials are currently underway which will be relevant to this review. The current trial of IPT by <LINK REF="STD-Spinelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spinelli 2005</LINK> will be important to confirm these preliminary findings, particularly considering the demographic characteristics of the sample in the pilot study, as well as the high attrition rate (<LINK REF="STD-Spinelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spinelli 2003</LINK>). The second trial underway, examining a brief cognitive behavioural therapy-based intervention, will also be of value in order to determine whether other modes of psychotherapy are effective in antenatal depression (<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2006</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-08 14:08:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of antenatal depression. The <LINK REF="STD-Spinelli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spinelli 2003</LINK> trial was too small, with a non-generalisable sample, to make any recommendations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-08 14:08:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The treatment of antenatal depression using psychosocial and psychological interventions is an area that has been neglected, despite the research clearly indicating that antenatal depression is a strong risk factor for postpartum depression. Future trials should include secondary outcomes in addition to maternal depression. These outcomes could include maternal satisfaction with the intervention, quality of life and neonatal outcomes. In addition, future trials should include extended follow-up assessments in order to determine whether the effects of the intervention are maintained into the postpartum period (e.g., assess longer-term outcomes). Active ingredients of the effective interventions also will need to be determined, in order to guide development of additional interventions. For example, IPT could have many potential active ingredients, including increases in level of social support available, improved communication skills and other specific skill sets depending upon the focus chosen (<LINK REF="REF-Weissman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 2000</LINK>). There is theoretical support for the effectiveness of increases in social support in reducing depression, both in perinatal women and in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2004</LINK>). As a result, other interventions that similarly mobilise support resources may be equally effective in treating antenatal depression. The trial currently underway evaluating the effectiveness of a 10-minute cognitive behavioural therapy-based intervention will help to clarify this point. Also needed are interventions to test whether effective interventions must be provided by a trained health professional. Interventions such as the Spinelli trials, in which time-consuming interventions are provided by trained therapists or other health professionals, may not be feasible in many settings.</P>
