<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-27 20:54:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), including oral contraceptive pills, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring, are administered daily for 21 days, followed by a hormone-free week. During the hormone-free week, uterine bleeding occurs. In recent years, other approaches to taking combined hormonal contraceptives have been developed. These include taking the CHCs for longer than 28 consecutive days. Some of the regimens plan occasional breaks in CHC use, while others do not. Delaying or eliminating the break in hormone use has become a popular way for women to avoid monthly bleeding, so we performed this review to compare these newer regimens to traditional CHC dosing regimens. We searched for all randomized controlled trials on this question in any language; we found twelve that met our criteria. The continuous or extended-cycle and traditional regimens appeared similar, as judged by bleeding, discontinuation rates, and reported satisfaction. The studies were too small to address efficacy, rare adverse events, and safety. Extended-cycle (for more than 28 days) or continuous dosing appears to be a reasonable approach to CHC use.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-04 00:33:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The avoidance of menstruation through continuous or extended (greater than 28 days) administration of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) has gained legitimacy through its use in treating endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstruation-associated symptoms. Avoidance of menstruation through extended or continuous use of CHCs for reasons of personal preference may have additional advantages to women, including improved compliance, greater satisfaction, fewer menstrual symptoms, and less menstruation-related absenteeism from work or school.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:22:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the differences between continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (pills, patch, ring) in regimens of greater than 28 days of active hormone compared with traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormones and 4 days of placebo). Our hypothesis was that continuous or extended-cycle CHCs have equivalent efficacy and safety but improved bleeding profiles, amenorrhea rates, adherence, continuation, participant satisfaction, and menstrual symptoms compared with standard cyclic CHCs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:22:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched computerized databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED, EMBASE, POPLINE, LILACS) for trials using continuous or extended CHCs (oral contraceptives, contraceptive ring and patch) during the years 1966 to 2013. We also searched the references in review articles and publications identified for inclusion in the protocol. Investigators were contacted regarding additional references.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomized controlled trials in any language comparing continuous or extended-cycle (greater than 28 days of active hormones) versus traditional cyclic administration (21 days of active hormones and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormones and 4 days of placebo) of CHCs for contraception.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:23:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches were assessed for potential inclusion. Data were extracted onto data collection forms and then entered into RevMan 5. Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all outcomes for dichotomous outcomes. Weighted mean difference was calculated for continuous outcomes. The trials were critically appraised by examining the following factors: study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, loss to follow-up, and early discontinuation. Because the included trials did not have a standard treatment (type of CHC formulation, route of delivery, or time length for continuous dosing), we could not aggregate data into meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:25:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Study findings were similar between 28-day and extended or continuous regimens in regard to contraceptive efficacy (i.e., pregnancy rates) and safety profiles. When compliance was reported, no difference between 28-day and extended or continuous cycles was found. Participants reported high satisfaction with both dosing regimens, but this was not an outcome universally studied. Overall discontinuation and discontinuation for bleeding problems were not uniformly higher in either group. The studies that reported menstrual symptoms found that the extended or continuous group fared better in terms of headaches, genital irritation, tiredness, bloating, and menstrual pain. Eleven out of the twelve studies found that bleeding patterns were either equivalent between groups or improved with extended or continuous cycles over time. Endometrial lining assessments by ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy were done in some participants and were all normal after cyclic or extended CHC use. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-27 20:54:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2014 update yielded four additional trials but unchanged conclusions. Evidence from existing randomized control trials comparing continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (greater than 28 days of active combined hormones) to traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormone and 4 days of placebo) is of good quality. However, the variations in type of hormones and time length for extended-cycle dosing make a formal meta-analysis impossible. Future studies should choose a previously described type of CHC and dosing regimen. More attention needs to be directed towards participant satisfaction, continuation, and menstruation-associated symptoms.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-17 04:45:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-27 21:05:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Is monthly menstruation necessary? In hunter-gatherer times, women had infrequent menstruations because they had closely spaced pregnancies, they breast fed their infants for long intervals (which suppresses ovulation and menstruation), and they died before reaching menopause. Prehistoric women had as few as 50 menstruations per lifetime, whereas the modern woman has approximately 450 bleeding episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional 28-day cycle (21 days of active hormones with 7 days of placebo, which allows a withdrawal bleed) produced by CHCs has no basis in biology. Indeed, the developers of the first combined oral contraceptives (COCs) adopted this regimen to mimic naturally occurring menstrual cycles. This decision was based on cultural and social pressures of the 1950s rather than on biological considerations (<LINK REF="REF-Gladwell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladwell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coutinho-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coutinho 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The avoidance of monthly withdrawal bleeds through the use of extended-cycle CHCs (greater than 28 days of active hormones, followed by a scheduled hormone-free interval) or continuous CHCs (no hormone-free interval) has gained legitimacy through its therapeutic uses. For example, continuous use of CHCs has successfully treated endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstrual-associated symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulak-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sulak 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sulak-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulak 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheewadhanaraks-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cheewadhanaraks 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dmitrovic-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Dmitrovic 2012</LINK>). </P>
<P>CHCs enable women to avoid menstruation for personal reasons as well. Avoidance of menstruation through extended or continuous dosing of CHCs has several potential advantages, including improved adherence to the regimen, less interference with daily activities or special events, decreased expense for feminine hygiene products, and less menstruation-related absenteeism from work or school (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cote-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cote 2002</LINK>). Some women, though, worry about the possibility of menstrual 'build-up,' creation of an 'unnatural' state, and the possibility of pregnancy with every missed period. However, with reassurance regarding safety, most women would prefer to delay or never have a period (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tonkelaar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonkelaar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glasier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 2003</LINK>). The preference for amenorrhea can be found in women from both developed and undeveloped countries (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glasier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weigratz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weigratz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andrist-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrist 2004</LINK>). Two studies have found that women in the military prefer continuous COCs for menstrual suppression, particularly during deployment (<LINK REF="REF-Trego-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trego 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Dunford-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Dunford 2011</LINK>). However, a potential downside to continuous or extended CHC dosing is greater unpredictability of bleeding episodes. </P>
<P>The physiology of CHCs and their impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis support the safety of continuous administration. CHCs inhibit follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, which in turn prevent follicular development, growth of the endometrial lining, and ovulation. The bleeding that occurs during the hormone-free interval is not due to endometrial 'build-up' but to hormone withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 1999</LINK>). Continuous CHC administration maintains a progestin effect resulting in a thin endometrium. In addition to endometrial lining suppression, continuous administration also appears to suppress pituitary and ovarian activity more effectively than cyclic administration does (<LINK REF="STD-Ruchhoft-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ruchhoft 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandever-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vandever 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birtch-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Birtch 2006</LINK>). The long-term health effects have not been documented (<LINK REF="STD-Archer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Archer 2006</LINK>), however one study found that continuous and cyclic regimens had a similar effect on metabolic variables (lipids, carbohydrates, hemostatic parameters, and sex hormone binding globulin) after one year of use (<LINK REF="STD-Rad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rad 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several monophasic and one quadriphasic levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol COCs in continuous or extended (greater than 28-day) cycles in the past 10 years. Most contain 84 days of active hormones followed by 7 days of placebo or a lower dose of ethinyl estradiol (10 mcg) alone instead of placebo. The quadriphasic formulation provides levonorgestrel with three ascending doses of ethinyl estradiol for 84 days, followed by 7 days of 10 mcg ethinyl estradiol alone. One continuous COC is available with no hormone-free interval, with all pills containing the same hormone dose. </P>
<P>Continuous and extended-cycle CHCs eliminate or decrease the frequency of scheduled withdrawal bleeds, but most users will experience occasional unscheduled bleeding or spotting. Prevention and treatment of unscheduled bleeding among women using CHCs is an active area of research. Progestin dose has not been found to affect the frequency of bleeding among women using continuous COCs (<LINK REF="STD-Kaneshiro-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaneshiro 2012</LINK>). Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline has been found to decrease unscheduled bleeding when administered to subjects who are switching from cyclic to continuous COCs (<LINK REF="REF-Kaneshiro-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaneshiro 2012a</LINK>), but does not effectively treat bleeding once continuous COCs have already been initiated (<LINK REF="REF-Kaneshiro-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaneshiro 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>New regimens for CHCs need to be evidence-based. Hence, this review examines the randomized controlled trials comparing extended-cycle (greater than 28 days of active hormones) or continuous regimens versus the traditional cyclic regimen of CHCs. This review does not include trials comparing traditional 28-day COCs (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo) to "extended" 28-day COC regimens with greater than 21 days (but less than 28 days) of active hormone and a shortened hormone-free interval. Several FDA-approved regimens are available containing 24 or 26 days of active hormones, with 4 or 2 days of placebo. Such regimens do not aim to decrease the number of withdrawal bleeds, but rather aim to decrease bleeding duration or quantity, or improve menstrual associated symptoms. One of the trials included in this review compares a cyclic COC containing 24 days of active hormone and 4 days of placebo with an extended regimen (greater than 28 days of active hormone) (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK>). </P>
<P>Researchers are now developing personalized COC regimens that allow women to initiate a hormone-free interval at their discretion, or in response to unscheduled bleeding. Such regimens offer women greater control over their bleeding pattern. Two new studies included in this review compare novel flexible dosing regimens to conventional cyclic regimens. </P>

<P>The primary reviewer evaluated the titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches and assessed relevant articles for potential inclusion. Continuous CHCs were defined as the use of active combined hormonal contraception for greater than 28 days. We contacted known investigators to request information regarding any published, unpublished or ongoing trials not discovered in our search. After extraction by both the primary and second reviewers to ensure accuracy, the data from the eligible trials were entered into RevMan 4.2. For the 2014 update, data was entered into RevMan 5.2. Peto odds ratios (Peto OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcomes. Data in the present review are based on the analytic method (e.g., intention-to-treat, per-protocol) used in the trial report. Results were not combined in meta-analysis since the eligible trials differed in the type of pill used, the time of exposure, definitions of bleeding, and analysis of bleeding. The trials were critically appraised by examining the study design, randomization method, group allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, loss to follow-up, and early discontinuation. Of note, in <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 1995</LINK>, we assumed that the standard deviations were misidentified in the report as standard errors since the latter statistics were improbable.</P>

<U>Endometrial assessment:</U> Assessment of the endometrium by ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy was done by <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>, 14 women in the extended group (n=16) volunteered to undergo endometrial stripe assessments by ultrasound; the mean thickness was 3.3 mm (SD 0.73, range 2 to 4 mm). No participant met criteria for biopsy (stripe &gt; 5 mm). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK> evaluated a volunteer subset of the study (28-day cycles, n = 7; 336-day cycles, n = 9), and two participants in the 336-day cycle group underwent assessments because of prolonged bleeding. All evaluations were performed during cycle nine. All endometrial stripe measurements were less than 5 mm and no evidence of hyperplasia was found on biopsy. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> obtained endometrial stripe measurements at study entry and exit in the majority of subjects. No differences between the 4 study arms or time points was found and measurements were well below the 10 mm safety cutoff [exit measurements: 28-day 3.4 mm (SD 2.3), 49-day 4.0 mm (SD 2.4), 91-day 4.5 mm (SD 2.2), 364-day 3.6 mm (SD 2.0)]. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> also performed endometrial biopsies on 10 volunteer subjects in each of the 4 study arms but no results were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK> assessed endometrial thickness by ultrasound and performed endometrial biopsies in most participants at baseline and study end.

There were no significant differences between groups in distribution of tissue histology. All subjects had atrophic, inactive, inadequate, OCP effect, or secretory histology at study end.</P>
<P>
<U>Bleeding patterns:</U> Bleeding patterns were the main outcomes for eleven studies. The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK> was COC continuation, but bleeding episodes and bleeding quantity were also assessed. Most trials showed either no difference between groups or less bleeding and/or spotting with extended or continuous dosing of COCs. Women in the continuous arm in the <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 1995</LINK> trial reported a mean of 10.7 less total bleeding days (95% CI -11.3 to -10.4) in the first trimester than the cyclic arm. The weighted mean differences for the second to fourth trimesters were similar. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK> found no statistically significant differences in the mean number of bleeding or spotting days for the four trimesters with one exception: the extended group had a mean of 4.5 and 3.9 less bleeding days (95% CI -7.1 to -1.9; 95% CI -6.8 to -1.04) in the first and third trimesters than the cyclic dosing group. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK> evaluated bleeding patterns over the entire 364-day study period, and reported no significant differences between groups for the mean bleeding plus spotting days. However, the extended arm had less bleeding-only days (WMD -14.3; 95% CI -17.7 to -11.0). <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK> found no difference between groups in the mean total bleeding days (bleeding plus spotting) and mean spotting days in either of the study's two (84-day) trimesters, but the extended group had less mean bleeding-only days than the cyclic group for both the first (WMD -7.7; 95% CI -14.0 to -1.5) and the second trimester (WMD -8.9; 95% CI -12.8 to -4.9). No clear picture regarding bleeding patterns emerged for the <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK> trial. The groups did not differ significantly for the mean total bleeding days during the four (84-days) trimesters. While the cyclic group had fewer mean spotting days during the first two trimesters (but not the last two trimesters), women in the extended group had less mean bleeding days for the four trimesters. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> provided bleeding days in mean percentages and medians over 91-day intervals but no information regarding amenorrhea. Direct comparisons between study arms using the median data cannot be made as each of the 91-day intervals had a different number of ring-free days. No significant differences in the percentage of total bleeding days were found between the 28-day group and the 3 extended dosing arms. <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2005</LINK> presented bleeding data only in median days and the percentage of each study arm that achieved amenorrhea (not the number of amenorrhea days) for days 1 to 84 and days 1 to 56. For days 1 to 84, median total bleeding days were no different (extended = 14 days, cyclic = 16 days, p = 0.407) but in the extended group, median bleeding-only days were significantly less (extended = 6 days, cyclic = 14 days, p &lt; 0.001) and percentage achieving amenorrhea were greater (OR 11.04, 95% CI 1.45-84.03). For days 1 to 56, the extended-cycle group had significantly less median total bleeding days (extended = 6, cyclic = 10, p = 0.009), median bleeding-only days (extended = 1, cyclic = 9, p &lt; 0.001), and a greater percentage achieving amenorrhea (OR 30.33, 95% CI 4-224.9). <LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK> analyzed bleeding outcomes differently from the five previous studies in that they analyzed bleeding during the withdrawal week separately. Bleeding associated with the withdrawal week was decreased for the 70-day cycle compared to 28-day cycle, but for mean bleeding and mean spotting days (analyzed over 70 days for the 70-day cycle and 84 days for the 28-day cycle), there were less days for the standard 28-day cycle group (p &lt; 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK> found no significant difference in mean number of bleeding days between groups for the 168-day study period (mean difference 3.7 days, 95% CI -6.2 to 13.6), but reported that the extended-cycle group had fewer moderate/heavy bleeding days (mean difference 5.8 days, 95% CI 1.8 to 9.7 days). Bleeding decreased significantly over time in both groups. 
<LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK> did not present the number of bleeding days for participants, but found that 62.2% (95% CI 46.6 to 77.8) of women in the extended group were amenorrheic during the 6th 28-day cycle, compared to 17.7% (95% CI 4.9 to 30.5) in the cyclic group (p=0.0001). The percentage of subjects reporting spotting was greater among the extended-cycle group only during the 3rd through 6th cycles. In <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK>, the mean number of total bleeding days (bleeding and spotting) was similar between groups in the first reference period, but was significantly less for the continuous (flexible) group in the second (WMD -2.3, 95% CI -4.38 to -0.22), third (WMD -3.4, 95% CI -5.58 to -1.22), and fourth (-4.1, 95% CI -6.26 to -1.94) reference periods. Bleeding days (requiring sanitary protection) were consistently less in the flexible group in all reference periods. Spotting only days were similar in the first and second trimester, but the cyclic group had less in the third and fourth trimesters. 
<LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK> reported bleeding incidence rates rather than mean bleeding days, and found that women in the cyclic group had 1.06 bleeding episodes per month compared to 0.56 in the continuous (tailored) group (p&lt;0.001). The rate of bleeding episodes lasting 3 days or more was significantly less in the tailored group (p&lt;0.001), while the rate of shorter episodes (less than 3 days) was less in the cyclic group (p&lt;0.001). Women in the cyclic arm reported bleeding on 15.9% of all days, compared to 9.6% of all days in the tailored arm (p&lt;0.001).</P>

<U>Menstrual-associated symptoms</U>: Seven studies reported data on menstruation-associated symptoms, which were collected with participant diaries (<LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK>) or by questionnaire at set time points (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK> only collected symptoms as adverse events (see adverse events). <LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK> monitored the increased or decreased frequency of headaches, nervousness, nausea, dizziness, depression, acne, and dysmenorrhea. The extended-cycle arm showed benefit for headache frequency (p &lt; 0.05), but otherwise no important differences in other menstruation-associated symptoms were found. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK> monitored the presence and severity of cramping, tiredness, headache, breast tenderness, and genital irritation. Genital irritation (p = 0.02), headache (p = 0.04), and tiredness (p = 0.05) were less severe in the 49-day cycle group than in the cyclic group but otherwise no differences were found between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK> collected data on headache, nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, premenstrual syndrome, and menstrual pain. No significant difference was found between groups except that women in the extended group were less likely to report bloating (OR -11.0; 95% CI -19.8 to -2.2) and menstrual pain (OR -11.5; 95% CI -18.4 to -4.5) than those in the continuous regimen. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> asked participants at 6 months and at study exit regarding the presence or absence of premenstrual syndrome, headaches, and pain with menses as compared to past contraceptive use. No differences between study groups was found. <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK> had participants complete the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the last study cycle. This questionnaire assesses scales for pain, water retention, autonomic reactions, negative affect, impaired concentration, behavior change, arousal, and control. Subjects in the extended-cycle group reported greater improvements in menstrual pain (p=0.01) and behavior change (p=0.04) compared to the cyclic group at the end the 6-month study period. <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK> evaluated menstrual-related symptoms using participant diaries. Presence and intensity of acne, dysmenorrhea, headache, mastalgia, nausea, irritability, edema, increased appetite, and breast swelling were measured. Only women in the extended-cycle group were found to have significant decreases in dysmenorrhea, headache, nausea, and acne. They also were found to have increased appetite. Edema decreased in both groups, while mastalgia decreased only in the cyclic group. <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK> asked subjects to report side effects at 12 months, including bloating, weight gain, headaches, skin changes, mood changes, abdominal cramps, tiredness, loss of interest in sex, breast tenderness, and aches and pains. No significant difference was found between groups in the intention-to-treat analysis. Loss of interest in sex was reported by a greater percentage of women in the continuous (tailored) arm, when analysis was restricted to women taking the COC as allocated (p=0.04).</P>

<U>Adverse events:</U> No serious adverse events related to the study medication or regimen were reported in ten trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutinho-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coutinho 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK> reported three adverse events likely related to study drug, including a pulmonary embolism (extended cycle), cholecystitis (28-day cycle), and an exacerbation of pre-existing depression (28-day cycle). The adverse event data also showed less headaches in the extended-cycle group than the traditional group (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK> also reported three adverse events likely related to study drug, including cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (49-day cycle), a known leiomyoma who underwent hysterectomy (364-day cycle), and a deep venous thrombosis (91-day cycle, testing positive for protein S deficiency and anticardiolipin antibodies).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:35:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from existing randomized control trials comparing continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (greater than 28 days of active hormones) to traditional monthly-cyclic dosing overall are of good quality. However, the variations in type of hormones, dose, delivery system (pill, ring or patch) and time length for extended dosing make a formal meta-analysis impossible. The trial numbers were too small to compare either contraceptive efficacy or rare adverse events.</P>
<P>Most bleeding outcomes showed either no major difference between groups or less bleeding and/or spotting with extended or continuous-dosing of CHCs. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK>) consistently had higher numbers of bleeding and spotting days for continuous cycles, but the authors did not include any of the withdrawal bleeding/spotting days in these calculations, which would have then demonstrated less bleeding/spotting days for the continuous cycle group. The novel regimens evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK> both demonstrated significantly less bleeding in the experimental arm (flexible or tailored regimen) compared to the standard cyclic arm. However, the decreased bleeding did not translate into higher satisfaction or continuation rates in either study.</P>
<P>Several menstruation-associated symptoms improved with extended dosing in the studies that looked at this outcome, including headaches (<LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK>), genital irritation (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>), tiredness (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>), bloating (<LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>), and menstrual pain (<LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Legro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall discontinuation rates were higher in extended dosing group for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>) but rates were similar between groups for the remaining eleven studies. Discontinuation rates due to bleeding problems were no different for five studies but were higher for the extended dosing groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cachrimanidou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cachrimanidou 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010a</LINK> trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK>, overall discontinuation of COCs was similar between groups, but women in the continuous (tailored) group were more likely to switch to the non-allocated regimen.</P>
<P>Participant satisfaction may be a proxy for adherence. Seven studies examined participant satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kwiecien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwiecien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK>), four of which had adherence outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2005</LINK>). Satisfaction was high in both 28-day and extended cycles for all seven studies. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2013</LINK>) found that satisfaction was significantly lower in the extended (tailored) arm. No important difference in compliance rates were seen between 28-day and extended cycles in any of the studies. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK> showed no substantial difference in compliance rates but did not appropriately compare satisfaction between the two groups. However, measurements of compliance through participant diaries have questionable validity.</P>
<P>Overall, hormonal contraceptives are safe and effective, and continuous or extended use is a reasonable approach to contraceptive use. Continuous administration of hormonal contraception for greater than 28 days (in continuous, extended, flexible, or tailored regimens) enables women to delay menses and may decrease bleeding. In future studies, more attention needs to be directed towards improving participant satisfaction and continuation, minimizing unscheduled bleeding, and decreasing menstruation-associated symptoms.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:30:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CHCs given continuously or in extended regimens (greater than 28 days of active hormone) and traditional cyclic dosing (less than 28 days of active hormone, followed by a hormone-free interval) have similar participant satisfaction, discontinuation rates (overall and for bleeding problems), and participant adherence. Bleeding patterns appear to be improved with continuous administration, with most studies showing a decrease in overall bleeding days. Menstruation-associated symptoms may be improved with extended continuous dosing. Outcomes depend on the specific dose, formulation, delivery system, or regimen. The trials sizes were inadequate to assess differences in safety and contraceptive effectiveness in the general population. Continuous or extended-dosing of CHCs is a reasonable approach for women without contraindications to estrogen-containing contraceptives.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-27 18:35:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More attention needs to be directed towards participant satisfaction, menstruation-associated symptoms, method continuation, and long-term health effects of continuous administration for all CHCs. Randomized controlled trials are not useful for studying potential long-term sequelae, so case-control studies or post-marketing surveillance will be required. Trials should report their methods and results in the manner consistent with CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Bleeding patterns should be reported in a standard fashion; we recommend the guidelines for data collection and analysis developed by the Hormonal Contraceptives Trial Methodology Consensus Conference in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 2007</LINK>), which were adapted from the WHO guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Belsey-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsey 1986</LINK>).</P>
