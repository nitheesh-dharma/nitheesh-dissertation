<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-09 16:27:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Evidence does not support routinely breaking the waters for women in normally progressing spontaneous labour or where labours have become prolonged.</P>
<P>The aim of breaking the waters (also known as artificial rupture of the membranes (ARM), or amniotomy), is to speed up and strengthen contractions, and thus shorten the length of labour. The membranes are punctured with a crochet-like long-handled hook during a vaginal examination, and the amniotic fluid floods out. Rupturing the membranes is thought to release chemicals and hormones that stimulate contractions. Amniotomy has been standard practice in recent years in many countries around the world. In some centres it is advocated and performed routinely in all women, and in many centres it is used for women whose labours have become prolonged. However, there is little evidence that a shorter labour has benefits for the mother or the baby. There are a number of potential important but rare risks associated with amniotomy, including problems with the umbilical cord or the baby's heart rate.</P>
<P>The review of studies assessed the use of amniotomy in all labours that started spontaneously. There were 15 studies identified, involving 5583 women, none of which assessed whether amniotomy increased women's pain in labour. The evidence showed no shortening of the length of first stage of labour and a possible increase in caesarean section. Routine amniotomy is not recommended as part of standard labour management and care.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-09 14:55:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Intentional artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes during labour, sometimes called amniotomy or 'breaking of the waters', is one of the most commonly performed procedures in modern obstetric and midwifery practice. It was introduced in the mid-eighteenth century, first being described in 1756 by an English obstetrician, Thomas Denman (<LINK REF="REF-Calder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 1999</LINK>). Whilst he emphasised reliance on the natural process of labour, he acknowledged that rupture of the membranes might be necessary in order to induce or accelerate labour (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1992</LINK>). Since then, the popularity of amniotomy as a procedure has varied over time (<LINK REF="REF-Busowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busowski 1995</LINK>), more recently becoming common practice in many maternity units throughout the UK and Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-Downe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1993</LINK>) and in parts of the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Camey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chanrachakul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanrachakul 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rana-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rana 2003</LINK>). The primary aim of amniotomy is to speed up contractions and, therefore, shorten the length of labour.</P>
<P>In order to carry out an amniotomy, the caregiver performs a vaginal examination to digitally identify the cervix and the amniotic membranes. The caregiver excludes the presence of blood vessels across the membranes (vasa praevia), and ensures the baby's head fits the pelvis well and is no higher than two stations above the ischial spines. The membranes are then punctured using a crotchet-like, long-handled hook (commonly referred to as an amnihook) and the membranes are torn apart digitally. The mechanism by which amniotomy speeds up labour remains unclear. It is thought that when the membranes are ruptured, the production and release of prostaglandins and oxytocin increases, resulting in stronger contractions and quicker cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Busowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busowski 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 1930s, Eastman suggested that the 'bag of water' surrounding the fetus played the principal role in the cervical dilatation and was therefore indispensable to normal labour (<LINK REF="REF-Busowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busowski 1995</LINK>). Since then this concept of a 'protective bag' around the baby buffering and protecting the infant from the immense forces of uterine contractions, as well as aiding cervical dilatation, has been supported by many (<LINK REF="REF-Caldeyro_x002d_Barcia-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldeyro-Barcia 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2005</LINK> advocated that the bulging membranes at the vaginal introitus serve to pre-stretch the perineum before the head has crowned. Pressure from intact membranes contributes to the ripening and effacement (softening and shortening) and dilatation of the cervix. The pressure exerted by the membranes stimulates oxytocin surges in much the same way as pressure from the fetal presenting part (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The membranes surrounding the fetus are composed of two layers: an inner amnion (nearest to the fetus) and an outer chorion (nearest to the lining of the pregnant womb, which is also known as the decidua). It is believed that softening and shortening of the cervix occurs in response to the prostaglandin PGE2, which is produced by both the amnion during pregnancy and also by the cervix itself at term.</P>
<P>During pregnancy the chorion represents a protective barrier between the amnion and the cervix. The chorion produces an enzyme called prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PDHG), which breaks down PGE2; thus preventing the cervix from ripening, and avoiding an inappropriate and premature labour.</P>
<P>There is a theory that in term pregnancies, the part of the chorion which is in direct contact with the opening of the cervix releases less PDHG. This allows the prostaglandins from the amnion to come into contact with the cervix, causing ripening and effacement (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Meir-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Meir 1997</LINK>). If amniotomy is performed, the influence of these prostaglandins on the cervix is therefore lost. This may explain in part why, if amniotomy is performed too early (that is, when the woman is less than 3 cm dilated), it can be counterproductive and slow the process of labour down.</P>
<P>The converse has also been advocated: amniotomy use as a method of augmenting complicated and long labours (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000b</LINK>). Many caregivers promote amniotomy on the clinical assumption that it increases labour contractions and therefore improves labour progress (<LINK REF="REF-Frigoletto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frigoletto 1995</LINK>), especially in those women with prolonged labour (<LINK REF="REF-Bohra-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohra 2003</LINK>). Prolonged labour can be an important cause of maternal morbidity and contributes significantly to the half a million women who die annually as a result of childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Haemorrhage and infection, which are strongly associated with long labours, are also leading causes of maternal death (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2003</LINK>). For this reason, amniotomy may be of particular importance for women in the developing world, who carry the greatest burden of morbidity and mortality associated with long labours.</P>
<P>As well as employing amniotomy as a method of shortening labour, many caregivers deem it valuable in order to introduce internal fetal monitoring devices, such as fetal scalp electrode or an intrauterine pressure catheter. It also allows visualisation of the amniotic fluid to detect meconium-stained liquor in order to identify factors, which may lead to fetal compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Clements-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clements 2001</LINK>). There is some suggestion that the quality of the amniotic fluid can only provide limited information, as meconium-stained liquor may be seen in up to 20% of normal pregnancies at term (<LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to evaluate the use of amniotomy to accelerate spontaneous labour, it is important to identify what constitutes normal length of labour. Confirmation of the progress of labour is determined by the identification of increasing cervical dilatation and cervical effacement (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2003</LINK>). The definition provided by the World Health Organization for primiparous women is that more than 18 hours in labour is considered prolonged (<LINK REF="REF-Kwast-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwast 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the active management of labour protocol, introduced by O'Driscoll and Meagher over 30 years ago in Dublin, the use of amniotomy has been widely and readily accepted by some clinicians as part of a package ensuring that women are in labour for no longer than 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Driscoll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Driscoll 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study exploring the perceptions of duration of labour of traditional birth attendants in Mexico found that 29% of them thought labour of a primipara normally lasts 13 hours, and 74% of them said the labour of a multiparous woman could last between four and eight hours, but no longer that 10 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Camey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camey 1996</LINK>). Another developing country (Thailand) classified normal labour would not exceed 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Chanrachakul-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanrachakul 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>As the definition of normality appears to be vague, with resulting variation in practice, no consensus has yet been reached amongst midwives and obstetricians to provide a definition of normality. For example, there is little agreement concerning the 'normality' of a labouring primigravida who has made slow but steady progress for 20 hours in the absence of maternal and fetal compromise (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2003</LINK>). Very little is also known about how important length of labour is to most women (<LINK REF="REF-Impey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 1999</LINK>). Reducing length of labour might not be a desired effect for all women. There are arguments that the length and progress of labour should not be based on the premise that all labours are the same, but by the woman and baby's wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Jowitt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jowitt 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1997</LINK>). Prolonged labour can ultimately be associated with delivery by caesarean section and low cord pH in the fetus. Amniotomy is employed with the assumption that shortening the length of labour is beneficial, with little apparent regard for any potential associated adverse effects. There is a lack of evidence to support or refute this assumption.</P>
<P>Although several theoretical hazards exist as a consequence of amniotomy, few studies show any substantial risks. Possible complications include umbilical cord prolapse, cord compression and fetal heart rate decelerations, increased ascending infection rate, bleeding from fetal or placental vessels and discomfort of the actual procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Busowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busowski 1995</LINK>). Data from studies suggest that early amniotomy increases the hourly rate of severe variable fetal heart rate decelerations without evidence of an adverse effect on neonatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 1997</LINK>). In areas of high HIV prevalence, it is considered prudent to leave the membranes intact for as long as possible to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Under normal conditions, the membranes remain intact until full dilatation in 70% of the cases (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>As well as the physical risks associated with amniotomy, psychological effects need to be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Clements-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clements 2001</LINK>). The largest UK consumer-directed research investigating women's attitudes surrounding the procedure of amniotomy identified that some women worried more about removing the protective bag of fluid cushioning the baby's head than the pain or duration of their labours (<LINK REF="REF-NCT-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT 1989</LINK>). Some women complain that amniotomy causes them to lose control in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2000</LINK>). However, others (<LINK REF="REF-Impey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 1999</LINK>) have concluded that women prefer shorter labours and have little bias against the intervention (amniotomy) that helps achieve this.</P>

<P>We included 15 trials (25 publications) in this review, totaling 5583 women. Of the three largest included trials, two were conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Amniotomy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">UK Amniotomy 1994</LINK>; comprising, 940 and 1463 women respectively), and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1993</LINK>, 925 women). Nine trials included both nulliparous and multiparous women, and six trials included nulliparous women only. In 14 trials, only women with a gestational age of at least 36 weeks were eligible for inclusion. The remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garite-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1993</LINK>) used an estimated fetal weight of 2500 to 4000 grams. Thirteen trials compared amniotomy with intention to preserve the membranes (no amniotomy) only. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1982</LINK>) compared amniotomy with intention to preserve the membranes but if membranes were still intact at full dilatation, amniotomy was performed. Some eligibility criteria were notably different between studies, for example, cervical dilatation at randomisation, which ranged from immediate amniotomy regardless of cervical dilatation to amniotomy at full cervical dilatation. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>) included women if their rate of progress in spontaneous labour crossed the action line of the partogram or they had made no progress over the previous two hours. One trial excluded women who did not achieve a spontaneous normal vaginal delivery without the use of oxytocin (<LINK REF="STD-Laros-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Laros 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the outcomes were consistently reported by all trials. The most commonly reported maternal outcomes pertained to mode of delivery (caesarean section and instrumental vaginal delivery), oxytocin use, analgesia use and length of second stage of labour. Maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience was only reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>). The most frequently reported neonatal outcome was Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (five trials). None of the trials reported economic outcomes; however, one author (<LINK REF="STD-Mikki-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mikki 2007</LINK>) provided additional information on length of hospital stay, which was divided into blocks of hours up to 24 hours and then a group of women whose hospital stay was greater than 24 hours. There was no information provided about the number of days in total, and we were unable to calculate the mean length of hospital stay. We therefore felt that we were unable to present these data in a useful way. Studies were predominantly single centre (n = 11), and most were conducted in the UK, USA and Canada.</P>

<P>All studies included in the review were randomised. Methods of sequence generation were clear in eight studies and unclear in seven. Clear randomisation methods included tables of random numbers, random-number generators and randomisation by computer program (including random numbers) (<LINK REF="STD-Ajadi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ajadi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garite-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laros-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Laros 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Amniotomy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">UK Amniotomy 1994</LINK>).

Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garite-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1993</LINK>) used sealed envelopes that were not described as being opaque or sequentially numbered, and <LINK REF="STD-Mikki-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mikki 2007</LINK> described using "simple randomisation with sealed envelopes".

<P>Overall the quality of included studies was variable. Several of the papers reported specific problems with recruitment and randomisation. Additionally, there was overlap of data between some of the included papers.</P>
<P>In two papers, a decision was made to stop the trial, one with only half the women recruited due to slow rate of recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>), and one due to budget constraints (<LINK REF="STD-Mikki-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mikki 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Barrett's paper (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>), a number of randomisation cards were lost due to women being randomised before they were diagnosed as being in established labour. These women were discharged from hospital without their names being recorded and without any note of their allocated intervention being made, and thus on readmission did not receive their randomised treatment. It was impossible to comment on whether this was accidental or intentional. A more rigorous system was introduced, ensuring that a record was kept for each card drawn. As a result, women who were randomised before they were in established labour received their allocated intervention on readmission. The results were analysed after the introduction of this system (120 women), and compared with the results for the whole study population (362 women). Findings noted in the comparison were that in the whole population there was a statistically significant difference between control and amniotomy groups for prevalence of fetal heart rate decelerations and epidural analgesia rate. In the group recruited after introduction of the new system there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for these outcomes, although the trend observed was the same.</P>
<P>The UK amniotomy collaborative trial (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Amniotomy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">UK Amniotomy 1994</LINK>) and primiparous women included in Johnson's paper (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1997</LINK>) are the same trial. Johnson's group, based at St James' in Leeds, also recruited multiparous women. To allow for completeness of data reporting on all the outcomes presented, we extracted data on primiparous women from the Johnson paper, as it was difficult to extract information on some reported outcomes for multiparous women only. In order to prevent doubling up of data, we carefully checked this information against the data presented in the UK amniotomy paper to allow us to accurately derive information from the UK amniotomy paper, excluding the Johnson data.</P>
<P>It was noted in the trial reports <LINK REF="STD-UK-Amniotomy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">UK Amniotomy 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1997</LINK>, that at St James', the computer randomly allocated women to a 4:3 ratio (amniotomy:control). This disparity was due to a computer programming error. It was stated in Johnson's paper that this error would not affect the study conclusions and that the effect on the statistical power was small.</P>
<P>There was no information detailed in any of the other included study reports regarding quality issues.</P>
<P>We assessed the risk of bias for each study, as summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-09 16:32:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this updated review, we examine the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for routinely shortening all labours that start spontaneously, and those labours that have started spontaneously but become prolonged.</P>
<P>A total of 5583 women were recruited into 15 trials comparing amniotomy with intention to preserve the membranes.</P>
<P>There were no differences observed between the two groups in the length of the first stage of labour. However, this outcome may be influenced by the differences between the inclusion criteria pertaining to the cervical dilatation at which women were randomised. For example, there may be a large time interval between women randomised at 3 cm and women randomised at 6 cm, which is not accounted for in the analysis. It is difficult to make recommendations for this reason. It is of interest that only five trials presented this outcome, when a common clinical justification for using amniotomy is in order to reduce the length of the first stage of labour. There was no difference in the length of second stage of labour between the two groups. There was, however, a statistically significant reduction in the length of the second stage of labour in the amniotomy group in primiparous women alone (mean difference (MD) -5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.98 to -0.89). This small difference is unlikely to be of clinical significance and probably does not justify the routine use of amniotomy in primiparous women.</P>
<P>There were several findings which were not statistically significant. The results show a trend towards an increase in the risk of a caesarean section which neared significance, in women who have had an amniotomy. It cannot be stated that there is no difference between the two groups on the basis that this finding nears statistical significance, and there are clinically significant implications and consequences of having a caesarean section. It should be noted that the indication for caesarean section was often unclear in the trial reports. There is a possibility that the method of fetal heart monitoring in labour may be a confounding variable affecting the indication for caesarean section, over and above whether a woman received an amniotomy or not. In a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>) looking at continuous cardiotocography (CTG) in labour, there was a significant increase in caesarean sections associated with continuous cardiotocography (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.13, n = 18,761, 10 trials). It was not clear from many of the trials included in our review whether women received continuous monitoring or not, and we were therefore unable to adjust for this. On these grounds, we would suggest that further research needs to be done looking specifically at this factor and allowing adjustment for potential confounding influences. From the four trials that did report on CTG abnormalities as an outcome, there was evidence nearing statistical significance that CTG abnormalities in the first stage of labour may be increased in those women randomised to the amniotomy group. There was no difference observed between the two groups for CTG abnormalities in the second stage of labour, although only one trial reported on this outcome.</P>
<P>There was a disappointing lack of information from most trials about maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience, especially given that 10 of the 14 trials were published from 1990 onwards. This outcome was reported in two trials involving a total of 123 women. Evidence presented in <LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK> showed a statistically significant improvement in maternal satisfaction in those women randomised to amniotomy. However, this study examined amniotomy for dysfunctional labour. As the authors suggested (<LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>), it could be argued that women's reported satisfaction regarding their allocated treatment may have been influenced by the caregivers' attitudes towards the allocated intervention, and women's own perceptions of dysfunctional labour requiring some sort of intervention such as amniotomy rather than a conservative approach. <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK> reports no significant difference in maternal satisfaction between the two groups.</P>
<P>There was evidence to suggest that there may be reduced risk of a five-minute Apgar score of less than seven in the amniotomy group, in women with normally progressing spontaneous labours. There were no data provided from any of the studies for Apgar scores at one minute. None of the studies reported raw Apgar scores and this may be a useful outcome measurement for future trialists to examine. Interestingly, few of the studies presenting data on Apgar scores provided information on cord pH. There was no evidence, from trials that reported on the risk of a cord pH of less than 7.2, of any difference between the two groups.</P>
<P>Evidence from this review suggests that the use of amniotomy as an intervention may reduce the incidence of dysfunctional labour. It should be borne in mind that this meta-analysis is subject to significant heterogeneity and it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about this outcome as a result. It should be noted that this statistically significant finding is based on only three studies, one of which (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1993</LINK>) did not present data on the length of the first and second stages of labour in their trial reports. The second of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mikki-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mikki 2007</LINK>) presented data on the length of the second stage of labour and did not suggest a significant difference between the two groups. The third of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shobeiri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shobeiri 2007</LINK>) suggested that amniotomy reduces the length of the first and second stage of labour.</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of women requiring oxytocin augmentation in the amniotomy group compared with the control group in women with normally progressing spontaneous labours. There was no information provided on the dosage of oxytocin required in the two groups, and this may be useful to know for drawing clinical conclusions about oxytocin use. It should be noted that some trials excluded women who required oxytocin following randomisation, and this may have influenced the overall result.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the use of pain relief between the two groups. It was not possible to separate those women who had received epidurals from those who had received other forms of analgesia, or those women who had received several different forms of analgesia. It would therefore be difficult to comment, for example, on whether amniotomy has any effect on the requirement for epidural analgesia. There was no information provided in any of the studies about how pain was assessed. This may be worth considering in further trials.</P>
<P>There were no differences between the two groups in terms of maternal mortality. One author (<LINK REF="STD-Mikki-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mikki 2007</LINK>) provided unpublished information on their study group, stating that there was one perinatal death in the amniotomy group due to congenital cardiac disease and lactic acidosis, however, the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>There were no differences found in any other outcomes examined in this review. However, many of the outcomes that fall into this category were only examined in single studies, and it would therefore be difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions.</P>
<P>The results presented above should be interpreted with caution. We noted that in nine out of 15 reports, more than 30% of women randomised to the control group (no amniotomy) received an amniotomy at some stage in their labour. The incidence of this observation ranged from 31% to 60%. One paper stated that the incidence was 20% and the remaining five papers provided no information. The reasons for amniotomy being performed were not always made clear. There are several explanations for why this may have happened. Few papers outlined specific criteria for deviating from the allocated intervention, with the majority of trials allowing clinicians to perform an amniotomy at their own discretion. It is likely that in most cases an amniotomy was performed in a woman allocated to the control group for a clinical reason, such as fetal compromise or in order to assess the amniotic fluid. We cannot comment on whether some women in the control group received amniotomy based on the clinician's personal preference or because amniotomy was contemporary 'recognised practice'. All data in the review were presented by allocated group (intention-to-treat), and not by the intervention actually received. This may have influenced the results, and hence the conclusions drawn.</P>
<P>Due to unclear presentation of data in some published reports, we were unable to extract information for certain outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-20 12:33:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the basis of the findings of this review, we do not recommend that amniotomy be introduced routinely as part of standard management and care for labour. In the current review, data for women with spontaneous labours that have become prolonged (<LINK REF="STD-Blanch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blanch 1998</LINK>) have been examined separately.</P>
<P>We recommend that the evidence presented in this review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made between women and their caregivers. It may be useful to provide information to women as part of their antenatal education.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-09 16:33:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We are unable to make any explicit recommendations regarding the use of amniotomy for the purposes of shortening spontaneous labour, when either progressing normally or becoming prolonged. We have identified that there is a need for large, well-designed multicentre randomised controlled trials with clear allocation concealment to be conducted, which will allow for robust conclusions to be drawn. It is of note that the largest trial included in this review, which was a multicentre trial, involved only 1463 women.</P>
<P>As a result of the findings of this Cochrane review, we make the following suggestions for the design and conduct of future trials investigating the use of amniotomy for shortening labour.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Large multicentre trials are needed, which look at clinically relevant outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Trials need clearly specified inclusion criteria, to allow for direct extrapolation to clinical populations. For example, results from a study looking at women who received amniotomy at 6 cm may not be applicable to a woman who is only 3 cm dilated, as the risks and benefits of amniotomy may be different. This clarity would also allow for more accurate comparability, both clinically, and also between trials for the purposes of systematic review by meta-analysis, allowing for more robust conclusions and recommendations.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There are several outcomes that were analysed that warrant further investigation, or require more detailed information to be collected. They include the length of first stage of labour, specifically looking at the cervical dilatation at the time of intervention and whether this impacts on the outcome measures in any way and allowing for adjustments to be made if this is the case; and the length of second stage of labour to evaluate further whether there are any clinically significant differences between the two groups. Maternal satisfaction is of crucial importance and should be investigated using recognised validated satisfaction scores in order to allow women to make informed choices about their care; cord pH is a less subjective measure than Apgar scoring and where feasible may be a more useful outcome. Caesarean section information should be presented alongside clear information about indications for caesarean section and timing in labour, adjusted for confounding factors such as continuous fetal monitoring; categorical information on the type and doses of analgesia used and pain-scoring methods and scores should be presented to allow for important pain-relief conclusions to be drawn, as outlined in the discussion, in order to allow women to make informed choices about their care; and more detailed information should be given on the need for oxytocin and the doses required in each of the two groups and may be more clinically useful than dichotomous data only.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Data on economic outcomes should be obtained, to allow for allocation of resources and service planning.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>As detailed in the discussion, there was a considerable amount of deviation from allocated intervention, with many women in the control group receiving amniotomy. We were unable to draw any conclusions about why this may have happened and it may have affected the comparability of the included studies and the validity of the results. It may be useful to record detailed information in future studies regarding the reasons for the allocated intervention not being adhered to for completeness, and to allow for comparability.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>It is difficult to blind women and caregivers to their randomised allocation because of the invasive nature of the intervention. It is possible to blind the outcome assessor to treatment allocation, which is strongly recommended. Any blinding should be clearly stated in the trial report.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Trial protocols should be made publicly available in order to allow comparison of the reported outcomes with prespecified outcomes. This will allow outcome reporting bias to be kept to a minimum.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>It is essential to involve consumers in any future trials at all stages, and most significantly during the planning stages, in order to identify those outcomes which are deemed of most relevance and importance.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was no information in any of the included trials regarding long-term outcomes for women and babies. We propose that future trialists should consider instituting some form of long-term follow-up which is feasible and appropriate for the study population in question.</LI>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>This is a lovely review. However it was a pity that the authors decided not to include the randomisation to delivery interval as an outcome variable. This is the only measure of labour duration that can be collected without significant risk of bias, and also the one that is most important to women. </P>
<P>Length of the first and the second stage of labour, measured separately, are both susceptible to bias. The time of onset of the first stage is difficult to determine objectively, and although full dilatation is a relatively objective measure, it requires a vaginal examination to make the diagnosis. The timing of vaginal examinations after early amniotomy might differ compared with women not undergoing amniotomy. </P>
<P>In designing the UK amniotomy trial I was very aware of this problem and put a lot of effort into ensuring that the time of randomisation and time of delivery were both recorded. This allowed us to report cumulative randomisation to delivery intervals, and it was clear that there was a modest reduction in the group allocated to early amniotomy. </P>
<P>I remain no fan of early amniotomy, but in fairness I think there is some evidence that it has a modest effect on shortening the overall randomisation to delivery interval. </P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-06-09 12:03:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The outcome 'randomisation to birth of baby interval' was included in the initial draft of our protocol for this review. Following peer review it was removed however, as the consumer panel commented that women might not find this information helpful, as the outcome has no meaning outside the context of a randomised trial. Also, although we agree that measurement of the duration of the first and second stage of labour is subject to bias and to variation between observers, these measurements are relevant as they are used in everyday midwifery and obstetric practice, and are the basis for clinical decisions.</P>
<P>We will reconsider whether to include 'randomisation to birth of baby interval' as an outcome when the review is updated.</P>

<P>The abstract suggest bias by the review authors. They refer to the 26% increase in the relative risk of Caesarean section associated with amniotomy rather than control as a &#8216;not statistically significant&#8217; difference, but call a 55% reduction in the relative risk of an Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes &#8216;no evidence of any statistical difference&#8217;. Furthermore, for primiparous women the difference in Apgar scores was statistically significant.</P>

<P>We agree the wording of the abstract appears biased.  This was an oversight on our part, and not intentional. The abstract has been revised so that the wording is consistent. </P>
<P>The analysis of Apgar score by parity was not included in the abstract as it was a subgroup, and reporting of results in the abstract is restricted to the main analyses.  These data are however presented in the results text.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (Rebecca Smyth (RS), Sarah K Alldred (SKA)) assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion and joint review of the data in the original article and discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence are described for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively-numbered, sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Attrition bias (loss of participants, for example, withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow-up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. Two review authors (RS, SKA) extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) to double enter all the data.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the weighted mean difference for outcomes measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but use different methods. If there had been evidence of skewness, we would have reported this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, we included all participants with available data in the analysis in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants had not been analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we would have restored them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>For future updates we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials if they are identified. Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta-analysis. Therefore, we will perform the meta-analysis in two parts as well.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We applied tests of heterogeneity between trials, using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), and explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis. We used a random-effects meta-analysis as an overall summary when considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to conduct the following subgroup analyses:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>parity: primigravid women compared with parous women;</LI>
<LI>previous mode of delivery: caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery and no previous delivery;</LI>
<LI>stage of labour: less than 3 cm dilated at time of amniotomy compared with 3 cm or more;</LI>
<LI>fetal surveillance: continuous fetal heart monitoring compared with intermittent;</LI>
<LI>pain relief: pharmacological compared with non-pharmacological;</LI>
<LI>indication for intervention: dysfunctional labour versus routine use or fetal compromise;</LI>
<LI>position in labour: mobile versus restricted movement in women without an epidural.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to conduct the following sensitivity analysis:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>for primary outcomes, excluding trials where more than 30% of women did not receive their allocated treatment;</LI>
<LI>by trial quality, excluding trials with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment (rated C).</LI>
