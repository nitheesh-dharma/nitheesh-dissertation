<P>For women with eclampsia, magnesium sulphate is better than phenytoin for preventing further seizures and other health problems for the women and their babies.</P>
<P>Between two and eight in every 100 pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia (toxaemia), which usually means they have high blood pressure and protein in the urine. A few women with pre-eclampsia will also have a seizure (fit), this is called eclampsia. Eclampsia is rare: in high-income countries two to three in every 10,000 pregnant women have eclampsia, and in low- and middle-income countries 16 to 69 in every 10,000 pregnant women. It is an important condition because women who have eclampsia have a high risk of being seriously ill and dying. Worldwide, more than half a million women die each year due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and 99% of these deaths are women in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, 15% of maternal deaths are associated with eclampsia.</P>
<P>The review of seven trials, involving 972 women, found that magnesium sulphate was substantially better than phenytoin in reducing the risk of maternal death and of having further seizures. It also appears safer for the baby. Other drugs (diazepam and lytic cocktail) have also been compared with magnesium sulphate for women with eclampsia in other reviews; magnesium sulphate was substantially better than these too.</P>

<P>Eclampsia, the occurrence of a seizure in association with pre-eclampsia, remains a rare but serious complication of pregnancy. A number of different anticonvulsants have been used to control eclamptic fits and to prevent further seizures.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We have included data from seven trials, involving 972 women. One large trial (775 women) was of good quality. Magnesium sulphate was associated with a substantial reduction in the recurrence of seizures, when compared to phenytoin (six trials, 972 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.49). The trend in maternal mortality favours magnesium sulphate, but the difference does not reach statistical significance (three trials, 847 women; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.05). There were reductions in the risk of pneumonia (one trial, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.79), ventilation (one trial, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91) and admission to an intensive care unit (one trial, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.89) associated with the use of magnesium sulphate rather than phenytoin.</P>
<P>For the baby, magnesium sulphate was associated with fewer admissions to a special care baby unit (SCBU) (one trial, 518 babies; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91) and fewer babies who died or were in SCBU for more than seven days (one trial, 643 babies; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95) than phenytoin. There was no clear difference in perinatal deaths (two trials, 665 babies; (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-12-01 12:17:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Magnesium sulphate, rather than phenytoin, for women with eclampsia reduces the risk ratio of recurrence of seizures, probably reduces the risk of maternal death, and improves outcome for the baby. Magnesium sulphate is the drug of choice for women with eclampsia. The use of phenytoin should be abandoned.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The aim of this review is to summarise the evidence about the differential effects of magnesium sulphate when compared with phenytoin for the care of women with eclampsia. This review should be viewed in conjunction with Cochrane reviews where magnesium sulphate is compared with diazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003a</LINK>) and with lytic cocktail (usually chlorpromazine, promethazine and pethidine) (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2000</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Pre-eclampsia ('toxaemia') is defined as raised blood pressure (hypertension) accompanied by proteinuria (protein in the urine) (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). Eclampsia is the occurrence of a seizure (fit) in association with pre-eclampsia. When severe, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia can involve the woman's liver, kidneys, clotting system, or brain. Rare but serious complications include stroke, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications are associated with an increased risk of maternal death. As pre-eclampsia and eclampsia can affect the placenta, risks for the baby are also increased. The most common problems are those related to poor intrauterine growth and premature birth, leading to an increase in perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ananth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ananth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). Perinatal mortality is particularly high following eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maternal mortality in parts of Africa and Asia is 100 to 200 times greater than it is in Europe and North America. In Western countries, the average lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes is between one in 4000 to one in 1000, whereas women in low-income countries have a risk between one in 15 and one in 20. There is no other public health statistic for which the disparity between high- and low-income countries is so wide. Eclampsia remains a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Between 10% to 15% of maternal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and 30% of maternal deaths in Africa are associated with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=700999072309501496&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Duley-1992#REF-Duley-1992">Duley 1992</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>), as are 15% of direct obstetric deaths in the (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>) and USA (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2003</LINK>)<I>.</I> In low- and middle-income countries most deaths associated with hypertension during pregnancy are due to eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1992</LINK>). In high-income countries, around half the deaths are associated with eclampsia, and half with pre-eclampsia. In low- and middle-income countries the case fatality is around 4% (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), whilst in high-income countries it appears to lower (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of a spectrum of conditions known as the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: this includes women with pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pre-existing hypertension, and pre-existing hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. The definitions and classification of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are discussed more fully in the generic protocol, 'Interventions for treating pre-eclampsia and its consequences' (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The terminology of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is misleading, as it implies a progression from mild disease to more severe, that pre-eclampsia precedes eclampsia, and that eclampsia is the most severe end of the spectrum. This is not the case, as some women have normal blood pressure at the time of their first fit, and some women become very sick and may even die without developing eclampsia. About one-quarter of cases of eclampsia occur without signs or symptoms suggestive of imminent eclampsia, such as headache and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Andersgaard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersgaard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Igberase-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Igberase 2006</LINK>). Nevertheless, women with severe pre-eclampsia are at particularly high risk of developing eclampsia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia</HEADING>
<P>Pre-eclampsia usually occurs during the second half of pregnancy and complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Eclampsia is rare in Europe, with two to three cases reported per 10,000 births (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kullberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kullberg 2002</LINK>). In low- and middle-income countries, eclampsia is more common, with the incidence estimated as 16 to 69 cases per 10,000 births ( <LINK REF="REF-Frias-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frias 2003</LINK>). An estimated 1.5 million to eight million women develop pre-eclampsia worldwide per year, of whom 150,000 may develop eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eclampsia can occur in pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Where the incidence is high, a greater proportion of women with eclampsia have the onset before the birth. In high-income countries, where incidence of eclampsia is lower, a greater proportion of women have postpartum onset (<LINK REF="REF-Andersgaard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersgaard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Igberase-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Igberase 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onuh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onuh 2004</LINK>). Gestation is also a factor, as women with eclampsia preterm are at least three times more likely to have their first seizure in the antepartum period than women who have eclampsia at term (<LINK REF="REF-Andersgaard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersgaard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>). Postpartum eclampsia is usually close to the time of birth, but may be days or even several weeks later (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology and pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>Despite a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, the underlying cause remains unclear. Factors that appear to have a role include maternal age, parity, obesity, maternal immune response, genetic predisposition, and maternal vascular disease (such as diabetes, chronic hypertension and autoimmune disease) (Duckitt 2005). Diet and nutrition may also have a role. Whether an individual woman will develop pre-eclampsia probably depends on which of these factors she has, and how they interact.  </P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is thought to occur as a result of inadequate blood supply to the placenta, related either to abnormal implantation, or to increased demand from the placenta (for example, in a multiple pregnancy). So, although pre-eclampsia is usually diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy, the antecedents are present much earlier. Current thinking is that inadequate blood supply to the placenta leads to the release of unknown factors or materials into the maternal circulation which activate or injure the endothelial cells, resulting in endothelial dysfunction (abnormal functioning of cells lining blood vessels) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002</LINK>). Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread vasoconstriction and activation of platelets and the coagulation system. Injured endothelial cells allow leakage of fluid out of the blood vessels and into surrounding tissues, causing oedema and a reduction in the circulating blood volume. There is then inadequate blood flow to many of the woman's organs, especially the kidneys, liver, and brain. It is the vasoconstriction, micro clots, and reduced circulating blood volume that result in the clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia. For a more detailed review of the aetiology and pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia <I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>.                           </P>
<P>The aetiology and pathophysiology of eclampsia are also incompletely understood. Although there are similarities between eclampsia and hypertensive crisis, the two conditions are not identical (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 1984</LINK>). Some women (around 6%) develop eclampsia with no apparent disturbance of blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1994</LINK>). Hence, although control of blood pressure is important, it will not necessarily prevent or treat eclampsia. Eclampsia is associated with cerebral oedema and cerebral vasospasm; and women with eclampsia may have cerebral oedema or cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Belfort-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfort 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk factors for eclampsia include a family history, little or no antenatal care, being less than 20 years old, having had four or more previous pregnancies, and two or more signs and symptoms of imminent eclampsia (such as headache, epigastric pain, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances and severe hypertension). In low- and middle-income countries, the majority (around 90%) of women with eclampsia have had limited access to care (<LINK REF="REF-Igberase-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Igberase 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onuh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onuh 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevention of eclampsia</HEADING>
<P>Primary prevention of eclampsia is preventing women from developing pre-eclampsia. Once the woman has pre-eclampsia, prevention is preventing progression to eclampsia. Screening for pre-eclampsia is an important part of antenatal care, and is based on the clinical history and examination (<LINK REF="REF-Milne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milne 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Various diagnostic tests have been advocated to identify women at particularly high risk of developing pre-eclampsia. So far none have proved to be of good predictive value, and so they are not recommended for clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Meads-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meads 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current strategies for prevention of pre-eclampsia can be broadly classified as antenatal surveillance, modification of lifestyle, nutritional supplementation, and pharmacological therapy (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>). Cochrane reviews of strategies for preventing pre-eclampsia include: lifestyle advice, such as altered dietary salt (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2005</LINK>) and exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2006</LINK>); the use of nutritional supplementation, such as calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2007</LINK>), magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2001</LINK>), zinc (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2007</LINK>), marine oils (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2006</LINK>), vitamins C and E (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2008</LINK>); and pharmacologic agents such as antiplatelet agents (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2007</LINK>) and nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Once women have pre-eclampsia, a Cochrane Review now provides robust evidence that magnesium sulphate halves the risk of eclampsia and probably reduces the risk of maternal death (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003a</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The only definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia or eclampsia is to end the pregnancy. The aim of interventions for women with eclampsia is to prevent further seizures, to minimise and treat any complications, and, if not delivered, to optimise the timing of birth for the baby. Other relevant Cochrane Reviews cover drug treatment for very high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2002</LINK>), plasma volume expansion (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1999</LINK>), and the timing of delivery for women before 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, standard care for women with eclampsia is to use an anticonvulsant drug to control the immediate fit, and to continue maintenance treatment to prevent further seizures. This review compares a policy of using magnesium sulphate with a policy of using phenytoin for the care of women with eclampsia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnesium sulphate</HEADING>
<P>Magnesium sulphate was introduced for care of women with eclampsia in the 1920s following reports of its use for control of convulsions due to tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>). Based on publication of several case series, it became standard care in several parts of the world, particularly in North America. Initially, magnesium sulphate was given in very low doses (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>), although it is now administered in relatively high doses. Common regimens are an initial intravenous loading dose of 4 grams (<LINK REF="REF-Dinsdale-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinsdale 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pritchard-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritchard 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zuspan-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuspan 1978</LINK>); followed by maintenance intravenous infusions of 1 gram per hour (<LINK REF="REF-Dinsdale-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinsdale 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zuspan-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuspan 1978</LINK>); or by 10 grams by intramuscular injection and then 5 grams intramuscularly every six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Eastman-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastman 1945</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Phenytoin</HEADING>
<P>Phenytoin was suggested in the 1980s for prevention and treatment of eclampsia because of its proven efficacy in epilepsy and its lack of any sedative effects for the mother or the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Slater-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slater 1987</LINK>). When first introduced for eclampsia, it was proposed that the treatment regimen should be adjusted for the weight of the women; a loading dose of 750 to 1250 mg (depending on weight) was given intravenously followed 12 hours later by a further 500 mg as a single oral dose or an intravenous infusion. As adjusting dose to the woman's weight is not always easy, and may delay treatment or lead to errors, this was quickly simplified. A common regimen was a loading dose of 1000 to 1500 mg as a short intravenous infusion, followed by a maintenance infusion of half the loading dose 12 hours later (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>), or smaller doses every six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Naidu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naidu 1992</LINK>). Other suggestions were to adjust the maintenance dose based on serum levels (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1993</LINK>), or to use a single loading dose (<LINK REF="REF-Coyaji-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyaji 1990</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnesium sulphate</HEADING>
<P>The mode of action for magnesium sulphate in control of eclamptic seizures and prevention of recurrent convulsions is still not clearly understood. Magnesium sulphate is not a traditional anticonvulsant, but nevertheless is better than the traditional anticonvulsant drugs at control of eclamptic seizures. This anticonvulsant activity may be mediated by magnesium's role as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (<LINK REF="REF-Euser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2009</LINK>). Stimulation of NMDA receptors by neurotransmitters such as glutamate may lead to seizures when neuronal networks are over-activated. Magnesium may prevent and control eclamptic seizures by inhibiting NMDA receptors. Other possible mechanisms are that magnesium sulphate may lead to cerebral vasodilatation with subsequent reduction of cerebral ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Belfort-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfort 1992</LINK>), and it may block some of the neuronal damage associated with ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadeh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadeh 1989</LINK>). The pathway for blocking neuronal damage may also be through NMDA inhibition.</P>
<P>Magnesium is also a calcium antagonist, and a smooth muscle relaxant. It may affect the cerebral endothelium which forms the blood brain barrier. Lowering intracellular calcium may limit paracellular transport of vascular contents, such as ions and proteins, effectively decreasing the factors which promote cerebral oedema and seizure activity (<LINK REF="REF-Euser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The calcium antagonist activity of magnesium sulphate has led to the belief that it also lowers systemic blood pressure, but this has not been supported by evidence from randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-MAGPIE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAGPIE 2002</LINK>). Magnesium sulphate does not appear to be an antihypertensive drug (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The adverse effects of magnesium sulphate come largely from its action as a smooth muscle relaxant. The most serious are respiratory depression, and respiratory and cardiac arrest. However, the adverse effects follow a dose response. Deep tendon reflexes are lost at a serum magnesium level of 10 mEq/L, with respiratory depression occurring at 15 mEq/L and cardiac arrest at greater than 15 mEq/L. This dose-response relationship means that clinical monitoring should ensure that toxicity and adverse effects are avoided. Provided deep tendon reflexes are present, toxicity and adverse effects will be avoided. Monitoring of serum magnesium levels is therefore not necessary, and clinical monitoring of tendon reflexes and respiration rate will ensure safe administration. As magnesium is excreted almost exclusively in the urine, women with impaired renal function will quickly have raised serum magnesium levels and be at risk of significant adverse effects if the dose is not reduced. Measuring hourly urine output should therefore be included in the clinical monitoring. If toxicity does develop, calcium gluconate is an effective antidote.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Phenytoin</HEADING>
<P>Phenytoin is widely used outside of pregnancy for acute and long-term control of seizures. The primary mechanism of action is thought to be inhibition of voltage sensitive sodium channels. This has the effect of blocking neurons which are firing too frequently, thereby calming the nervous system. Phenytoin acts as an anticonvulsant without causing sedation (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2006</LINK>). Phenytoin prevents the onset of seizures, but is not useful for aborting or controlling seizures once they occur. When phenytoin is used for women with eclampsia, diazepam is therefore used for control of any acute seizures.</P>
<P>When given as an intravenous infusion, the onset to action for phenytoin is 30 to 60 minutes. The half life depends on plasma concentration, and ranges between seven and 22 hours. Phenytoin is primarily excreted in urine but is metabolised by the liver.</P>
<P>Phenytoin can be administered orally and intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be avoided due to the risk of tissue necrosis. Rapid intravenous administration can lead to hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Toxicity can also lead to nystagmus and ataxia.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-09-06 14:56:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim was to compare the differential effects of magnesium sulphate, given either by the intramuscular or the intravenous route, rather than phenytoin for the care of women with eclampsia. The comparison was in terms of maternal mortality, recurrence of convulsions, other serious morbidity that could lead to death, and use of health service resources. For women who were entered into the trials before delivery, additional outcomes were those related to labour, delivery, and mortality and morbidity of the baby.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-USA-_x002d_-Baltimore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">USA - Baltimore 1993</LINK>) included women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and the two women with eclampsia were both randomised to the same treatment arm, so it was not possible to enter these data in the meta-analysis. The remaining six trials recruited 972 women, with 80% (775/972) in the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>). The other five trials were all small.</P>
<P>In the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), 15% of women were postpartum when randomised. Another study also recruited women who were antepartum or postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-USA-_x002d_-Memphis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">USA - Memphis 1995</LINK>), and a third recruited only women who were antepartum (<LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1990" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1990</LINK>). In the remaining studies, it is not stated whether women were antepartum or postpartum at recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Brazil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brazil 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-India-1999" TYPE="STUDY">India 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1996</LINK>). Overall, about 60% of the women had had an anticonvulsant before trial entry. In one trial, immediate control of fits for women allocated phenytoin was with diazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>). In another study all women received clonazepam before trial entry (<LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1990" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1990</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-India-1999" TYPE="STUDY">India 1999</LINK>), nifedipine was given to all women after recruitment.</P>
<P>Most of the women who received magnesium sulphate in these trials had 4 g as a loading dose, and maintenance therapy was either by an intramuscular regimen or an infusion of 1 g/hour. In three trials, magnesium sulphate maintenance was given by intravenous infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Brazil-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brazil 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1990" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USA-_x002d_-Memphis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">USA - Memphis 1995</LINK>); in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-India-1999" TYPE="STUDY">India 1999</LINK>) maintenance therapy was given by intramuscular injection. In the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), each hospital in the study chose whether they used intravenous or intramuscular maintenance therapy. One study (<LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1996</LINK>) used a loading dose only. For this study, the only outcome included in this review is recurrence of seizures.</P>
<P>For most women, duration of treatment was 24 hours. Women were monitored clinically, using respiratory activity, urine output and tendon reflexes. Magnesium and phenytoin serum monitoring was also used in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-1990" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USA-_x002d_-Baltimore-1993" TYPE="STUDY">USA - Baltimore 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USA-_x002d_-Memphis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">USA - Memphis 1995</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), women randomised to phenytoin also received cardiac monitoring.</P>
<P>For the baby, most of the outcome data in this review come from the single large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Maternal death</HEADING>
<P>Three trials (847 women) reported maternal deaths, but no deaths occurred in the two small studies (72 women).

This was the largest study included in the review. When the analyses were restricted to this study (775 women), the results are consistent with those in the review overall: for recurrence of seizures (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.53), and for maternal death (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.05).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>For women with eclampsia, using magnesium sulphate rather than phenytoin reduces the risk ratio of recurrence of seizures by 66% (95% CI 51% to 76%). Although the reduction in the risk of maternal death does not quite achieve statistical significance, it seems likely that the risk of death is also reduced in favour of magnesium sulphate. The risk of pneumonia is also reduced, and the reduction in need for admission to intensive care and ventilation are consistent with the reduction in pneumonia.</P>
<P>For the baby, there is no clear difference between the groups in the risk ratio of perinatal or neonatal death. Magnesium sulphate is associated with a reduction in admission to a special care baby unit, and in the composite outcome of death or in a special care baby unit for more than seven days.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>All trials in this review reported recurrence of seizures, and three reported maternal deaths. Reporting of other measures of maternal morbidity varied, but missing data were largely from the small trials. Data on outcome for the child is less complete, with only two studies reporting baby deaths and just one study reporting any measures of neonatal morbidity.</P>
<P>Recruitment to trials in this review was primarily from hospitals in low- and middle-income countries, which is where 99% of maternal deaths occur. However, the evidence supporting magnesium sulphate, rather than phenytoin for women with eclampsia, is also applicable to women in high-income countries. The low incidence of eclampsia makes it unlikely that trials of sufficient size could ever be conducted in high-income countries. In addition, the reduction in recurrence of seizures associated with magnesium sulphate, rather than diazepam or phenytoin, is large and consistent across the subgroups, and the settings included in this review. Although the effect size may vary in other settings, it is unlikely to change direction. For example, following publication of the Collaborative Eclampsia Study (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), practice in the UK changed within one year (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most trials reported using clinical monitoring during administration of magnesium sulphate. Three small trials reported using serum monitoring. The evidence of benefit from magnesium sulphate, rather than phenytoin, for women with eclampsia is primarily based on studies where clinical monitoring alone was used. This is important, as magnesium sulphate is a relatively low-cost drug but, if serum magnesium monitoring was necessary, this would make its use expensive. Also, serum monitoring is not available in many of the places where women present with eclampsia. In high-income countries, although 24-hour access to serum magnesium monitoring may be more widely available, it is nevertheless costly.</P>
<P>The Collaborative Eclampsia Trial used sealed treatment packs for recruitment into the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>). These 'eclampsia packs' were designed to make recruitment to the trial easier and quicker than usual clinical practice. Such packs are now widely used in high-income countries, and some low- and middle-income countries. They include the loading dose of magnesium sulphate, maintenance therapy, and calcium gluconate for use in the event of toxicity, plus everything needed to initiate treatment (such as syringe, needle, intravenous canula, swabs, a giving set and a pack of 500 ml 0.9% intravenous saline) and instructions for administration and clinical monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>). Administration and clinical monitoring of magnesium sulphate can be carried out by medical, midwifery or nursing staff, provided they are appropriately trained.</P>
<P>Women with eclampsia may present at primary care level. As these women are at high risk for adverse outcome, they are often transferred to secondary or tertiary care level. None of the trials in this review were conducted at primary care level, and none included evaluation of care during the transfer to a higher level of care.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-07-06 11:35:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lelia Duley">
<P>Although seven trials are included in this review, only six contributed data. As most of these were small, data in the review are largely derived from one high-quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>). This study, the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), contributed two-thirds of the data in the review (775/972). Study quality in the other trials was low to average due to methodological concerns, or unclear (<I>see</I> risk of bias tables).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The search strategy for this review was extensive, with no language restriction. One of the problems in identifying potentially eligible studies for this review is that they are likely to have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries, where eclampsia is more common. If such studies are published in journals not easy to access, or remain unpublished, they may not have been identified by our search strategy. We would welcome information about any additional studies potentially eligible for this review (please send information to: l.duley@leeds.ac.uk).</P>
<P>As one of the review authors was a principal investigator for the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collab-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Collab Trial 1995</LINK>), two other review authors performed data extraction for this study.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>This review should be viewed in conjunction with the Cochrane Reviews comparing magnesium sulphate with diazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003a</LINK>) and with lytic cocktail (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2000</LINK>). Overall, there is now compelling evidence in favour of magnesium sulphate, rather than diazepam, phenytoin or lytic cocktail for the treatment of eclampsia. Magnesium sulphate is the anticonvulsant of choice for women with eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheth 2002</LINK>) and this use is endorsed by national and international guidelines and recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-ANZCA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZCA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Magnesium sulphate is relatively affordable, and should be made available for the care of women with eclampsia, particularly in middle- and low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheth 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) calls for a reduction by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015, in the maternal mortality ratio. Universal implementation of magnesium sulphate for treatment of women with eclampsia would be a substantial step towards achieving this goal (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ensuring more women with eclampsia receive appropriate treatment with magnesium sulphate will require dedicated, focused and co-ordinated action at several levels. There is a need for governments, donors and international agencies concerned with women's health, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) to, as a priority, increase support for effective care for women with eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2007</LINK>). This support should include advocacy and funding to help ensure magnesium sulphate is registered and available for care of women with eclampsia in all middle- and low-income countries. In addition governments, together with national associations of obstetricians and midwives, should ensure appropriate training of all relevant health professionals (including obstetricians, midwives, emergency-room doctors, anaesthetists, nurses, medical officers and pharmacists) in the management of  women with eclampsia and in the use of magnesium sulphate.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The use of phenytoin for women with eclampsia should be abandoned. Magnesium sulphate is relatively cheap and easy to use. It should be made available for treatment of all women with eclampsia.</P>
<P>Magnesium sulphate is the drug of choice for treatment of women with eclampsia, both whilst they have a seizure (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003a</LINK>), and to prevent recurrence of further seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003b</LINK>). Duration of treatment should not normally exceed 24 hours. The intravenous or intramuscular route can be used for maintenance therapy. If the intravenous route is used, the dose should not exceed 1 g/hour. Clinical monitoring of respiration, urine output and tendon reflexes is essential. Serum monitoring is not necessary.</P>
<P>As magnesium sulphate is relatively cheap and easy to produce, it is appropriate for use in low- and middle-income countries. Nevertheless, access to magnesium sulphate remains poor in some low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Aaserud-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaserud 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sevene-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sevene 2005</LINK>). Low-income countries should include magnesium sulphate for management of eclampsia on their national essential drug list. National guidelines for care of women with eclampsia should be available and widely disseminated in each country. Health workers should be trained in the appropriate use of magnesium sulphate. The use of eclampsia packs (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1996</LINK>) would facilitate implementation of magnesium sulphate in all settings which provide care to women with eclampsia.  Given that only an estimated 150,000 women develop eclampsia each year (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2003</LINK>), the provision of these kits would be a relatively modest cost in relation to global health assistance budgets.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether a loading dose of magnesium sulphate should be given to women at primary care level before they are transferred to hospital, but this would seem sensible to consider. Factors in this decision are likely to include how long it will take to get the woman to hospital, and whether support and clinical monitoring will be available during transfer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-06 15:23:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lelia Duley">
<P>Magnesium sulphate is now the gold standard against which any new anticonvulsants for women with eclampsia should be compared in properly designed randomised trials. The trials in this review recruited women in secondary and tertiary level hospitals. Questions which merit further research include: whether a loading dose of magnesium sulphate should be given to women at primary care level before transfer to hospital; the minimum effective dose; and the optimal mode of administration and duration of treatment.</P>
<P>Any future trials should be of adequate size, and report mortality, serious morbidity and use of health service resources for both the women and the child.</P>
<P>Eclampsia can be distinguished from other forms of seizures in that it is better controlled by magnesium sulphate than by either diazepam or phenytoin (both conventional anticonvulsants), which may offer opportunities to explore the pathogenesis of eclampsia.</P>
