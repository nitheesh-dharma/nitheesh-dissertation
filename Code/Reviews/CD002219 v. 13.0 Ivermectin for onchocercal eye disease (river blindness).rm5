<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 19:16:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Onchocerciasis is caused by tiny worms and is transmitted from person to person by a small biting fly. The fly breeds in fast flowing rivers and streams mainly in West Africa. The disease causes severe itching and thickening of the skin and damages structures at the front and back of the eye. It also affects the nerve that connects the eye with the brain.</P>
<P>Four studies based in west Africa were included in the review; two small studies in Ghana and Liberia and two larger community-based ones in Nigeria and Sierra-Leone. In the smaller studies, people with onchocercal infection were given one dose of ivermectin or placebo and followed up for one year. In the larger studies all individuals in selected communities were treated every six or 12 months with ivermectin or placebo, whether or not they were infected, and followed for two to three years. This review found that ivermectin can prevent damage to the front of the eye but its effectiveness in preventing blindness remains uncertain.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 17:21:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>It is believed that ivermectin (a microfilaricide) could prevent blindness due to onchocerciasis. However, when given to everyone in communities where onchocerciasis is common, the effects of ivermectin on lesions affecting the eye are uncertain and data on whether the drug prevents visual loss are unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-21 13:52:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing visual impairment and visual field loss in onchocercal eye disease. The secondary aim was to assess the effects of ivermectin on lesions affecting the eye in onchocerciasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:00:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY=" Iris Gordon">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1950 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 April 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-06-16 13:28:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials with at least one year of follow-up comparing ivermectin with placebo or no treatment. Participants in the trials were people normally resident in endemic onchocercal communities with or without one or more characteristic signs of ocular onchocerciasis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:00:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information. As trials varied in design and setting, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-14 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The review included four trials: two small studies (n = 398) in which people with onchocercal infection were given one dose of ivermectin or placebo and followed up for one year; and two larger community-based studies (n = 4941) whereby all individuals in selected communities were treated every six or 12 months with ivermectin or placebo, whether or not they were infected, and followed for two to three years. The studies provide evidence that treating people who have onchocerciasis with ivermectin reduces the number of microfilariae in their skin and eye(s) and reduces the number of punctate opacities. There was weaker evidence that ivermectin reduced the risk of chorioretinitis. The studies were too small and of too short a duration to provide evidence for an effect on sclerosing keratitis, iridocyclitis, optic nerve disease or visual loss. One community-based study in communities mesoendemic for the savannah strain of <I>O.volvulus </I>provided evidence that annual mass treatment with ivermectin reduces the risk of new cases of optic nerve disease and visual field loss. The other community-based study of mass biannual treatment of ivermectin in communities affected by the forest strain of <I>O.volvulus</I> demonstrated reductions in microfilarial load, punctate keratitis and iridocyclitis but not sclerosing keratitis, chorioretinitis, optic atrophy or visual impairment. The study was underpowered to estimate the effect of ivermectin on visual impairment and other less frequent clinical signs. The studies included in this review reported some adverse effects, in particular an increased risk of postural hypotension in people treated with ivermectin.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-14 17:32:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The lack of evidence for prevention of visual impairment and blindness should not be interpreted to mean that ivermectin is not effective, however, clearly this is a key question that remains unanswered. The main evidence for a protective effect of mass treatment with ivermectin on visual field loss and optic nerve disease comes from communities mesoendemic for the savannah strain of <I>O.volvulus. </I>Whether these findings can be applied to communities with different endemicity and affected by the forest strain is unclear. Serious adverse effects were rarely reported. None of the studies, however, were conducted in areas where people are infected with <I>Loa loa</I> (loiasis).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:07:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:06:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Onchocerciasis is an insect-borne disease caused by the filaria nematode (<I>Onchocerca volvulus</I>). It is transmitted from person to person by black-flies (<I>Simulium</I> species). Onchocerciasis is also called river blindness because the black-fly vector breeds in fast-flowing rivers and transmission is generally limited to people who live or work near such rivers.</P>
<P>The infective worms enter the human body through the black-fly bite and develop into mature adult worms (macrofilariae). The adult worms mate and the adult female produces millions of baby worms (microfilariae) which migrate throughout the skin. The actual route of entry of microfilariae into the eye is not known but proposed routes include the sheaths of the posterior ciliary arteries and nerves (arteries and nerves supplying the eye), the blood circulation, the cerebrospinal fluid and along the orbital septum and the cheek ligaments. Microfilariae may be seen in the cornea (the transparent outer wall of the eye) or the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and the iris) by the slit lamp (an optical microscope used for examining the eye). While alive, the microfilariae cause little or no inflammation or immune response. Onchocercal eye disease generally develops after a long exposure to onchocercal infection, although eye lesions may occur rapidly when the intensity of infection is high. Generally, eye lesions tend to appear in individuals between the age of 30 and 45 years and are usually more commonly seen in males who work outdoors.</P>
<P>The main pathological changes seen in the back of the eye appear to be related to the local invasion and death of the microfilariae within the retinal tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Burnham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnham 1998</LINK>). It is believed that the dead microfilariae precipitate a severe inflammatory reaction which leads to the characteristic lesions affecting the back of the eye associated with ocular morbidity and blindness (<LINK REF="REF-Winthrop-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winthrop 2011</LINK>). Additional research has identified <I>Wolbachia</I>, a bacteria which lives symbiotically within the mature adults worms (<LINK REF="REF-Saint--Andre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint Andre 2002</LINK>). The presence of the <I>Wolbachia </I>or microfilariae may be responsible for the inflammatory immune response in front of the eye which is associated with punctate keratitis (inflammatory changes seen in the cornea that appear as fluffy white opacities); sclerosing keratitis (severe inflammatory changes seen in the cornea associated with corneal scarring); and iridocyclitis (inflammatory changes seen in the iris) (<LINK REF="REF-Hise-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hise 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saint--Andre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint Andre 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of the lesions affecting the back of the eye: chorioretinitis (inflammation of the choroid and the retina); and optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve) with subsequent optic atrophy (loss of nerve fibres in the optic nerve) is less clear and somewhat controversial. An autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed based on the observation of the structural similarity between an <I>onchocerca volvulus</I> antigen (Ov39) and a human retinal antigen (hr44) (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1996</LINK>). This similarity may initiate the development of an autoimmune disease that has the potential to progress even in the absence of the organism. In other words, the chorioretinal pathology is initiated by the presence of local microfilariae, whereas the extension of the lesions does not require their presence (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1997</LINK>). This would explain why the decrease in ocular microfilarial loads following ivermectin treatment reported in some trials does not interrupt the pathological process in the retina which probably was initiated early in life (i.e. before the age of 15 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Chippaux-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chippaux 1999</LINK>). This raises the question of whether treatment with ivermectin can be expected to prevent progressive posterior segment disease or indeed long-term blindness from this cause. The main pathways to blindness due to onchocerciasis are sclerosing keratitis, chorioretinitis and optic nerve disease, although blindness can result from lesions that affect different parts of the eye i.e. iridocyclitis leading to secondary cataract (opacity of the lens within the eye) or secondary glaucoma (increase in pressure within the eye).</P>
<P>Onchocerciasis is endemic in 34 countries; 26 in the African region, six in the region of the Americas and two in the Eastern Mediterranean (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1998</LINK>). As a public health problem the disease is most closely associated with Africa, where it constitutes a serious obstacle to socio-economic development. Recent estimates indicate that about 18 million people globally are infected of whom 99% are in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). A further 120 million people world-wide are at risk of developing the disease, 96% of whom are in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Onchocerciasis causes severe skin disease but the main public health importance of the disease is blindness. Of the 18 million people infected with the disease an estimated 270,000 are blind and 500,000 severely visually disabled (<LINK REF="REF-Rolland-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland 1974</LINK>). The overall consequences of onchocerciasis can only be fully appreciated when uni-ocular blindness, visual impairment and constriction of the peripheral visual field are taken into consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Abiose-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abiose 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murdoch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murdoch 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-16 13:37:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Ivermectin (marketed as Mectizan), a microfilaricide, has been used for the treatment of parasites of domestic animals for many years. In 1982 ivermectin was tested in patients with onchocerciasis and was found to reduce significantly the microfilarial counts in skin snips of infected individuals for a period of six months to one year (<LINK REF="REF-Aziz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 1982</LINK>). It has been suggested from dose-finding trials that 150 micrograms/kg body weight represents an optimal dose of ivermectin (<LINK REF="REF-White-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1987</LINK>). The exclusion criteria for ivermectin use include children less than five years; pregnant women; women breastfeeding within one month of giving birth and individuals with disorders of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy).</P>
<P>Clinical trials and subsequent field experience have shown that ivermectin is a rapidly effective, well-tolerated, single dose, microfilaricide which causes little or no Mazzotti reaction (severe inflammatory response) and is suitable for use in mass campaigns (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1998</LINK>). Commonly reported adverse effects after ivermectin use are skin reactions including itching; musculoskeletal pains; fever; swelling of the face, joints and limbs; headaches and dizziness; lymphadenopathy; eye reactions and nodule pain. These are usually mild and self-limiting. Some individuals may develop a severe symptomatic postural hypotension (a sudden fall in blood pressure) which may require emergency facilities for resuscitation.</P>
<P>Concerns have been expressed recently over the potential for ivermectin to cause unconsciousness in treated individuals who have concomitant <I>Loa loa</I> infection (another kind of filarial worm infestation), with very high microfilaraemia. <LINK REF="REF-Gardon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardon 1997</LINK> reported two cases of probable <I>Loa</I> encephalopathy after mass treatment of about 17,877 persons with ivermectin in the Lekie area of Cameroon, where onchocerciasis and loiasis are both endemic. Consequently it has been proposed that, before launching mass ivermectin distribution programs, communities in which the intensity of concomitant <I>Loa loa</I> microfilaraemia are highly in need of being identified and monitoring strategies instituted before treatment begins (<LINK REF="REF-Boussinesq-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boussinesq 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from its use in controlling onchocerciasis, it has been reported that ivermectin has a secondary effect of reducing intestinal helminths in humans. <LINK REF="REF-Whitworth-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitworth 1991b</LINK> showed that ivermectin had a significant effect on <I>Ascaris</I> (round worm) infection, reducing prevalence and intensity for at least three months. In a qualitative study in north-east Nigeria on community-perceived benefits of ivermectin treatment, worm expulsion was the most frequently stated benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Akogun-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akogun 2000</LINK>). Other perceived benefits were an increase in vitality, sexual drive and performance.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:07:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the exact pharmacological action of ivermectin is not well known, it is believed to exert its anti-parasitic action on microfilariae either by acting directly as a Gaba-amino-butyric-acid (GABA) agonist or by causing an increase in tonic GABA release. It may therefore interfere with neural transmission causing paralysis of parasites (<LINK REF="REF-Aziz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 1982</LINK>). Apart from its microfilaricidal effects, ivermectin has also been observed to inhibit the release of microfilariae from the adult worm's uterus. The end result of these actions is a reduction in microfilarial loads in the body and eyes, prevention of progression of onchocercal lesions in the eye and skin and possibly prevention of blindness in the long term.</P>
<P>The control of onchocerciasis as a public health problem was achieved with the introduction of treatment with ivermectin annually or every six-months in endemic communities. However, there is some debate regarding the potential role of annual mass treatment with ivermectin in reducing transmission in endemic communities in order to achieve elimination to the extent at which treatment may be stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Abiose-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abiose 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2000</LINK>). It has been shown that distribution of ivermectin to 60% of the population results in a 70% to 75% post-treatment reduction in infected flies (<LINK REF="REF-Remme-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remme 1990</LINK>). Similarly, mass treatment with ivermectin has been shown to be associated with a 94% reduction in the number of flies with developing infective larvae (<LINK REF="REF-Trpis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trpis 1990</LINK>). Repeated annual treatment with ivermectin in Liberia was shown to reduce the incidence of new infections in untreated children by about 40% in the second year (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1990</LINK>). Based on longitudinal research treatment over 15 to 17 years can interrupt transmission and reduce the expected number of new infections below levels postulated to achieve elimination (<LINK REF="REF-Diawara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diawara 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekle 2012</LINK>). Even after treatment was stopped no new infections or transmission was detected after two years of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Diawara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diawara 2009</LINK>). It is now believed that new infections and interruption of transmission can be achieved with treatment alone in endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Diawara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diawara 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tekle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekle 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-25 16:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The control of onchocerciasis has been based at various times on large-scale nodulectomy, vector control or large-scale chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic agents used prior to 1987 were suramin and diethylcarbamazine. While suramin was a good macrofilaricide (efficacious in killing the adult worms), it requires intravenous injection and was found to be toxic to the kidneys. Diethylcarbamazine, a microfilaricide (efficacious in killing the baby worms), was associated with the development of the Mazzotti reaction, in which massive destruction and death of the baby worms stimulated a severe inflammatory response. This was shown to precipitate and accelerate the progression of optic nerve disease in individuals with a heavy onchocercal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a new global strategy for controlling onchocerciasis that is based on yearly administration of single doses of ivermectin to affected populations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Ivermectin is currently employed by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) and the Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme for the Americas (OEPA) for mass treatment in hyper and mesoendemic communities. In 1987, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. pledged to provide, at no cost, all the drugs necessary for as long as needed to overcome onchocerciasis as a public health problem. Between 1987 and the end of 1996, more than 65 million doses of ivermectin had been donated for distribution (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blindness remains the single most important public health problem posed by onchocerciasis. Although ivermectin has been shown to be an excellent microfilaricide, it is unclear how this translates to real benefits in terms of blindness prevention for those who suffer the disease. The microfilaricidal activity of ivermectin, no matter how great, is of only academic interest if a villager at risk of blindness from onchocerciasis cannot be told in clear terms how taking the drug reduces that risk. So far, evaluation of the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing blindness has been based on surrogate measures such as the reduction of skin and ocular microfilarial loads, as well as possible improvement in anterior segment lesions (lesions affecting the front of the eye) such as punctate keratitis, sclerosing keratitis or iridocyclitis or some of the posterior segment lesions (lesions affecting the back of the eye) such as chorioretinitis or optic nerve disease. However, there are conflicting reports concerning the effects of ivermectin on these lesions as well as uncertainties about its effectiveness in preventing progressive visual loss especially from lesions affecting the back of the eye. This review, therefore, aimed to summarise systematically all the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relating to the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing progressive visual loss as well as its effects on onchocercal eye lesions in order to provide current best evidence on which to base decisions for practice and further research.</P>

<P>Two review authors extracted data using a form developed by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group and entered data into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>). We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We combined data on the proportion of participants with early and advanced stages of the following lesions - keratitis, iridocyclitis, chorioretinitis and optic nerve disease. i.e. data on early and late keratitis were combined to give data on keratitis as an outcome. We combined data for the number of participants with a microfilariae count between one and four and those with a microfilariae count above four into the proportion of participants with a microfilariae count of more than one.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:12:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>For the first version of this review, we assessed trial quality according to methods set out in Section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Four parameters were considered: allocation concealment; masking of participants and providers; masking of outcome assessment; and completeness of follow-up. Each parameter for trial quality was graded: A (adequate); B (unclear); C (inadequate). The a priori criterion for exclusion was that trials scoring C on allocation concealment were excluded. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and disagreement was resolved by discussion. Review authors were not masked to the report authors and trial details during the assessment.</P>
<P>For the update in 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration's recommended tool for assessing risk of bias was used. This is a domain-based evaluation of allocation, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. The 'Risk of bias' tables were completed by one review author (JE) and checked by another author (HE). For the 2012 update, the review authors' judgements within the 'Risk of bias' tabes were labelled as: high; low; or unclear risk of bias as described in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 19:02:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We calculated risk ratios for outcome measures reported as dichotomous data. We did not calculate summary measures for outcome measures reported as continuous data as neither standard deviations nor confidence intervals were reported.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 19:02:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We had anticipated that there would be cluster randomised trials available for this review, however, none were identified. All trials reported outcomes per person, not per eye.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:12:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Our main analyses assume that missing data are missing at random. However, to see how reasonable this assumption might be we also performed sensitivity analyses with different assumptions about the missing data using methods as set out by White et al (<LINK REF="REF-White-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2008</LINK>). The "informative missingness odds ratio" (IMOR) refers to the ratio of the odds of the outcome among participants for whom data were missing and the odds of the outcome among participants who were observed. These IMORs can be assumed to be equal or different in the two trial arms. We performed four sensitivity analyses for selected outcomes. Firstly, we assumed the IMOR was 2 in treatment and control groups i.e. that people who were not seen were twice as likely to have the outcome. Secondly, we assumed that the IMOR was <SUP>1</SUP>/<SUB>2</SUB> in both treatment and control groups i.e. that people who were not seen were half as likely to have the outcome. For the third and fourth sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the IMOR was opposite in treatment and control groups - i.e. 2 or <SUP>1</SUP>/<SUB>2</SUB>.</P>
<P>We carried out all analyses using the <I>metamiss</I> command in Stata (version 10.1, StataCorp LP, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, TX 77845 USA).</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-05 11:11:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We planned to investigate publication bias by carrying out a scatter plot of the effect estimates from the individual studies against their standard error. An asymmetric graph may indicate that smaller studies that are not statistically significant have not been published, although it also may indicate that the effects of treatment are different in small studies. Currently not enough trials are included in the analyses to assess publication bias.</P>
<P>We investigated selective outcome reporting by carrying out an "outcome matrix" and classifying missing outcomes according to the following classification (adapted from a list provided by Paula Williamson at a Cochrane training workshop on selective outcome reporting bias, Edinburgh March 2009).</P>
<P>A: States outcome analysed but only reported the P value &gt; 0.05 i.e. NS<BR/>B: States outcome analysed but only reported that P value &lt; 0.05<BR/>C: Clear that outcome was analysed but insufficient data presented to be included in meta-analysis or full tabulation<BR/>D: Clear that outcome was analysed but no results reported<BR/>E: Clear that outcome was measured (for example, includes structurally related outcomes) but not necessarily analysed<BR/>F: States that outcome was not measured<BR/>G: Not mentioned but clinical judgement says likely to have been measured<BR/>H: Not mentioned but clinical judgement says unlikely to have been measured<BR/>I: Other give details</P>

<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> summarises the characteristics of the included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Setting and participants</HEADING>
<P>All four studies took place in west Africa: Liberia (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>), northern Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Abiose-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Abiose 1993</LINK>), northern Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK>) and southern Sierra-Leone (<LINK REF="STD-Whitworth-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Whitworth 1991a</LINK>). All the studies recruited participants normally resident in endemic onchocercal communities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In all trials ivermectin was compared with placebo. The usual dose was 150 µg/kg body weight, however, <LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK> had three treatment groups of 100,150 and 200 µg/kg. As the results of these groups were similar they have been pooled for the purposes of this review. Ivermectin was given as a single dose in <LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK>. In the community-based studies four annual (<LINK REF="STD-Abiose-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Abiose 1993</LINK>) or biannual (<LINK REF="STD-Whitworth-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Whitworth 1991a</LINK>) doses were given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Assessment of outcome measures was by ocular or systemic examination. This included skin snip tests and visual field examination in some cases. The assessments were undertaken by specialist doctors or specially trained eye nurses. Outcome measures were assessed and reported differently in the studies. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Abiose-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Abiose 1993</LINK> visual field was assessed using the Friedmann Mark 1 Visual Field Analyser and visual field deterioration was defined as an absolute loss of at least 19 illuminated spots. In <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK> visual field was assessed using the clear dome perimeter with a 2 mm fibre-optic target, and visual field classified as either full, showing peripheral loss, loss to 20° of fixation, loss to 10° or loss to 5°. We have presented a descriptive report of the analyses of data from each of the four included trials.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-16 14:08:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This review includes the results of two different types of studies: two small studies in which people with onchocercal infection were given one dose of ivermectin or placebo and followed up for one year; and two larger community-based studies whereby all individuals in selected communities were treated every six or 12 months with ivermectin or placebo, whether or not they were infected, and followed for two to three years.</P>
<P>As the two types of studies are addressing two different questions we will consider them separately.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Ivermectin to prevent and treat onchocercal eye disease and its consequences in people infected with <I>O.volvulus</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>See '<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>'.</P>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1988</LINK> provide evidence that treating people who have onchocerciasis with ivermectin reduces the number of microfilariae in their skin and eye (not shown in the 'Summary of findings' table) and reduces the number of punctate opacities. There was weaker evidence that ivermectin reduced the risk of chorioretinitis. There was no evidence for a protective effect for sclerosing keratitis, iridocyclitis, optic nerve disease or visual loss. However, the studies were too small and of too short a duration to provide evidence on these less frequent consequences of onchocercal infection.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Ivermectin to prevent and treat onchocercal eye disease in people living in communities affected by <I>O.volvulus</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>See '<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>'.</P>
<P>The results of one community-based study provides evidence that annual mass treatment with ivermectin reduces the risk of new cases of optic nerve disease and visual field loss in communities mesoendemic for the savannah strain of <I>O.volvulus</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Abiose-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Abiose 1993</LINK>). The other community-based study, with mass biannual treatment of ivermectin in communities affected by the forest strain, demonstrated reductions in microfilarial load (not shown in the 'Summary of findings' table), punctate keratitis and iridocyclitis but not sclerosing keratitis, chorioretinitis, optic atrophy or visual impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Whitworth-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Whitworth 1991a</LINK>). However, this study was underpowered to estimate the effect of ivermectin on visual impairment and other less frequent clinical signs. Only a small number of new cases of visual impairment developed over two years (11 cases in total, not all of which could be attributed to onchocerciasis).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Whitworth-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Whitworth 1991a</LINK>, ivermectin was associated with a higher prevalence of adverse drug reactions compared with placebo, however, this was not statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK> showed a nine-fold increased risk of severe symptomatic postural hypotension in the ivermectin group but this was not statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-16 14:21:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>With only four trials included in this review, the evidence for ivermectin in the treatment of onchocercal disease is incomplete. We can say with confidence that ivermectin reduces the microfilarial load and number of punctate opacities. However, the evidence for its effect on other signs of onchocercal eye disease, such as sclerosing keratitis, chorioretinitis and optic nerve disease is less certain. Most importantly, the effect of ivermectin in preventing visual loss, which is an outcome of primary importance to people suffering from river blindness, is unclear. The trials included in this systematic review were not primarily designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ivermectin in preventing onchocercal blindness and this outcome was not commonly reported. The lack of evidence for prevention of visual impairment and blindness should not be interpreted to mean that ivermectin does not have these effects, however, clearly this is a key question that remains unanswered.</P>
<P>Only two community-based trials are included in this review, one conducted in communities mesoendemic for the savannah strain in northern Nigeria and one in communities affected by the forest strain in Sierra-Leone. The Nigerian study demonstrated a protective effect of mass treatment with ivermectin on the incidence of optic nerve disease and visual field loss. However, it is unclear whether this finding applies to other communities with higher or lower infection rates and to communities affected by other strains of <I>O.volvulus. </I>Several reports suggest that onchocercal blindness is less common in forested areas compared with savannah areas, where blindness rates can reach 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Burnham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pond-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pond 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>). It is believed that the savannah strain is more aggressive than the forest strain. These factors could influence the overall response of participants to the treatment being evaluated.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review reported some adverse effects, in particular an increased risk of postural hypotension in people treated with ivermectin. Unlike diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin does not rapidly eliminate microfilariae. This means that the Mazzotti reaction, which results from a massive overkill of numerous macrofilariae all at once, is unlikely to be serious with ivermectin. However, none of the studies have been conducted in areas where people are infected with <I>Loa loa </I>(loiasis). Some studies have suggested that serious neurological adverse effects can occur when ivermectin is given to people with heavy infections of <I>Loa loa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gardon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardon 1997</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-06 09:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>All the trials included in this review used a placebo-controlled group and therefore outcome assessment was graded as low risk of bias. The use of a placebo probably meant that sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate as well but this was less well reported. Information on follow-up was less well reported and there may well be bias due to incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>A limitation of this review is the fact that all four trials included are published trials. It is possible that there are unpublished trials we did not identify. If trials with negative findings are more likely to remain unpublished (publication bias), the efficacy of ivermectin may be overestimated in this review. Visual examination of a funnel plot might have helped in determining the role of publication bias in this review. Multiple trials, which have reported a common outcome from which estimates of effects can be calculated, are needed in order to carry out a funnel plot. None of the reported outcomes in the four trials included in this review was uniformly reported in all the trials. Furthermore, the primary outcome measure for this review was explicitly reported in only one trial. Extensive efforts were made to contact pharmaceutical companies, trial authors and acknowledged experts in the area of onchocerciasis for unpublished trials of ivermectin for onchocerciasis in order to reduce the risk of publication bias. None was identified.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 22:23:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer R Evans">
<P>The review methods were revised for the update in 2009. This could have introduced bias if the choice of methods was influenced by knowledge of the results of the included trials. However, we think this is unlikely as the methods used are fairly standard. The conclusions of the review have not changed. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-16 14:11:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The lack of convincing evidence for the effectiveness of ivermectin in the prevention of onchocercal blindness was also noted by Abiose in a narrative overview of onchocercal ocular disease and the impact of ivermectin treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Abiose-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abiose 1998</LINK>). Abiose noted that 'in none of the studies was there any evidence of a reduction in the prevalence of blindness and a few new cases due to [onchocercal ocular disease] were observed. It may take a long time for the effect of Mectizan on the incidence of blindness to become apparent'.</P>
<P>Adverse effects have been noted in observational studies. In a review of eight uncontrolled community trials to determine the safety of ivermectin during large-scale treatment, <LINK REF="REF-De_x002d_Sole-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">De-Sole 1989</LINK> reported 49 cases of severe symptomatic postural hypotension among 50,929 persons treated from eight countries. This represents an incidence of approximately 0.1% over 72 hours. <LINK REF="REF-Chijioke-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chijioke 1992</LINK> reported two cases of severe symptomatic postural hypotension among 7556 people treated with ivermectin in south-east Nigeria. With the exception of rare serious reactions such as severe systematic postural hypotension, ivermectin is generally well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Goa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goa 1991</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:59:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-16 14:11:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Some of the trials included in this review demonstrate that ivermectin may be effective in reducing punctate keratitis and iridocyclitis. However, its effectiveness in reducing chorioretinal lesions and preventing visual acuity loss in onchocercal eye disease remains unclear. The evidence for the effectiveness of ivermectin in the reduction of the incidence of onchocercal visual field loss and optic nerve disease reported in one trial with the savannah type strain should be applied with caution to hyperendemic onchocercal communities in which the forest type strain predominates.</P>
<P>As the benefits and harms of mass treatment with ivermectin are not well established, treatment programmes should monitor the effects of their programmes carefully.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:59:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The single most important public health problem posed by onchocerciasis is blindness and visual impairment. Future trials should not only focus on the microfilaricidal properties of ivermectin, but also consider its effects on posterior segment lesions, particularly chorioretinitis and its effectiveness in preventing visual acuity loss.</P>
<P>Given the widely held belief that ivermectin is the drug of choice for preventing and controlling blindness due to onchocerciasis, the present lack of suitable alternatives and ethical considerations may make it difficult for placebo-controlled randomised trials of ivermectin to be undertaken in the future. Scientists have intensified efforts on finding appropriate drugs which can kill the adult worms of onchocerciasis. Recently some eight anti-cancer compounds with potential macrofilaricidal properties have been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Kinnanom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinnanom 2000</LINK>). In addition, Dr Mark Taylor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has reported potential macrofilaricidal property of antibiotics of the tetracycline group. Certain species of bacteria (<I>Wolbachia</I>) are known to infect filarial worms; these probably play an important role in their fertility and contribute to the pathogenesis of filarial disease. Tetracyline antibiotics 'cure' the worms of their bacteria and in doing so affect the viability of the worms (<LINK REF="REF-Hoerauf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoerauf 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>). Current studies are underway which are investigating the effects of moxidectin (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00790998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00790998</LINK>) and doxycyline (<LINK REF="REF-ISRCTN95189962" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISRCTN95189962</LINK>) relative to ivermectin. </P>
<P>Future trials should have appropriate sample sizes allowing sufficient power to detect important treatment differences with respect to preventing visual loss in onchocerciasis. The duration of these trials should be sufficiently long to be able to detect meaningful changes in visual acuity. Anticipating that these trials would be in rural communities, simple visual acuity tests such as the illiterate E chart could be used and outcome measures could be reported as 'proportion of participants in each treatment group becoming visually impaired or blind during follow-up' using the WHO definition. However, the visual acuity or visual field in the worse eye rather than the better eye should define an individual with visual impairment or blindness. This is to ensure that the real impact of onchocerciasis on blindness and visual impairment is not underestimated.</P>

<P>After consulting with the Cochrane Eyes and Vision editorial base, the review authors have decided to no longer update this review. The basis for this decision is in part due to ivermectin as the current standard of care which prohibits future placebo-controlled trials. Additional advances in the treatment and elimination of onchocerciasis now include combination treatments with a single dose of ivermectin plus daily doxycycline. Future Cochrane systematic reviews addressing additional therapies such as combination therapies for the treatment and elimination of onchocerciasis will add to the current evidence summarised here.</P>

<P>"At registration a master card was completed for each individual. It carried identification information, including a photograph, a unique pre-printed identification number, and a pre-printed sequential treatment group number between 1 and 30. Merck, Sharp and Dohme donated 30 identical containers, numbered 1-30, to which ivermectin (6 mg per tablet) or a visually indistinguishable placebo tablet had been randomly allocated.

<P>"The doses of ivermectin or placebo were formulated as identical capsules and presented in pre-packed, precoded envelopes, each containing five capsules, and labelled with weight ranges and allocation numbers. On admission into hospital, the patients were given the allocation numbers sequentially and the contents of the envelopes with three weight ranges into which their body weights fitted. This procedure generated four groups of patients: the first with 49 patients who took 100 mcg/kg; the second with 50 patients who had 150 mcg/kg, the third with 50 patients who received 200 mcg/kg body weight of ivermectin and fourth with 49 patients who were given placebo consisting of 185 mg corn starch (STA-RX L500)."<LINK REF="STD-Dadzie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dadzie 1989</LINK>

<P>Communities endemic for onchocerciasis were treated i.e. everyone aged 5 years and above received ivermectin or placebo. However, as very few people aged less than 15 years will experience significant onchocercal eye disease children under the age of 15 years were not examined at follow-up. Although this means that not everyone treated was examined, as this was an a priori decision at study design stage, and intervention/control groups were treated the same it is unlikely to have lead to any bias in estimating the effect of the intervention.</P>
