<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-06 10:33:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravascular brachytherapy (radiation treatment) inside arteries after angioplasty, stent insertion, or bypass grafts may prevent narrowing of the arteries or grafts. Narrowed and blocked arteries can be treated by bypassing the blockage using a graft, angioplasty (widening the artery by inserting a balloon), or inserting a stent (thin metal sleeve) to hold the artery open. However, restenosis (return of the narrowing or obstruction) often occurs within a year. Intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) aims to prevent restenosis by the application of radiation to the affected part of the artery after the angioplasty or stent insertion.</P>
<P>This review included eight studies with a total of 1090 participants. All eight included studies used the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries. All trials compared angioplasty with or without stenting plus IVBT with angioplasty with or without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to newer technologies such as drug eluting stents, balloons, or cryoplasty. Intravascular brachytherapy resulted in increased cumulative patency, reduced restenosis, and fewer occlusions on short-term follow-ups. However, results from the eight included trials were not consistent and long-term outcomes need to be fully assessed. Therefore, more research is needed especially regarding the long-term outcomes and complications of this treatment, and the health economics and cost-effectiveness data.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-30 06:38:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventional treatment of arteries that are narrowed and obstructed by atherosclerosis involves either bypassing the blockage using a graft; widening the artery from the inside with a balloon, a procedure known as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA); or providing a strut to hold the vessel open, known as a stent. All of these treatments are, however, limited by the high numbers that fail within a year. Intravascular brachytherapy is the application of radiation directly to the site of vessel narrowing. It is known to inhibit the processes that lead to restenosis (narrowing) of vessels and grafts after treatment. This is an update of a review first published in 2002.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-06 10:33:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials with a combined total of 1090 participants were included in this review. All included studies used the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries. All studies compared PTA with or without stenting plus IVBT versus PTA with or without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to technologies such as drug eluting stents or balloons, or cryoplasty. Follow-up ranged from six months to five years. The quality of the included trials was moderate with our concerns relating to the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the procedures and the small sample sizes for some studies. Primary outcomes (patency or restenosis and need for re-intervention) were reported in the majority of the trials, but reporting at various time points and the use of multiple definitions of the outcomes by the included studies meant that not all data were available for pooling. The secondary outcomes were not reported in many of the included studies.</P>
<P>For brachytherapy, cumulative patency was higher at 24 months (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.10, n = 222, P = 0.002). A statistically significant difference was found for restenosis at six months (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.66, n = 562, P = 0.004), 12 months (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, n = 375, P = 0.0002) and 24 months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78, n = 164, P = 0.007) in favour of IVBT. No difference was found after five years as measured in one study. The need for re-interventions was reported in six studies. Target lesion revascularisation was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with IVBT compared with angioplasty alone (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97, P = 0.04) at six months after the interventions. No statistically significant difference was found between the procedures on the need for re-intervention at 12 and 24 months after the procedures.</P>
<P>A statistically significant lower number of occlusions was found in the control group at more than three months (OR 11.46, 95% CI 1.44 to 90.96, n = 363, P = 0.02) but no differences were found at less than one month nor at 12 months after the procedures making the clinical significance uncertain. Ankle brachial index was statistically significantly better for IVBT at the 12 month follow-up (mean difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, n = 100, P = 0.02) but no statistically significant differences were found at 24 hours and at six months.</P>
<P>Quality of life, complications, limb loss, cardiovascular deaths, death from all causes, pain free walking distance and maximum walking distance on a treadmill were similar for the two arms of the trials with no statistically significant difference found between the treatment groups.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-29 05:24:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for using peripheral artery brachytherapy as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to maintain patency and for the prevention of restenosis in people with peripheral vascular disease is limited, mainly due to the inconsistency of assessment and reporting of clinically relevant outcomes. More data are needed on clinically relevant outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQOL) or limb salvage and longer-term outcomes, together with comparisons with other techniques such as drug eluting balloons and stents. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials, health economics and cost-effectiveness data are required before the procedure could be recommended for widespread use.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-06 10:39:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>In the UK and US, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occurs in 4.5% to 7% of people over the age of 55 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dewhurst-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewhurst 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvin 2004</LINK>). In 25% of these patients, the condition will deteriorate and require treatment but fewer than 5% will go on to develop limb threatening critical limb ischaemia (CLI) (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1991</LINK>). CLI is diagnosed only in 1% to 2% of all patients with PAD at the initial presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2006</LINK>). More than 50% of those who require treatment will be suitable candidates for endovascular methods of intervention (<LINK REF="REF-London-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">London 1995</LINK>) and patients with CLI have a 50% risk of major amputation if they do not undergo revascularisation (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2006</LINK>). Patients with PAD have a shorter life expectancy due to the coexistence of other cardiovascular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Stansby-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stansby 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane review of trials (which included only 98 participants in total) suggested that although angioplasty may be of short-term benefit, this may not be sustained in the long-term (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2006</LINK>). Narrowing of the artery following angioplasty (restenosis) is the major cause of long-term failure. Restenosis is caused by three processes, immediate elastic recoil of the vessel, myointimal hyperplasia (enlargement of the inner muscular layer of vessels), and late vascular remodelling (changes in the vessel, produced in response to physical stresses on the vessel wall, which affect the shape and volume of the vessel). The addition of acute thrombosis can lead to complete occlusion (obstruction or complete blockage) of a restenosed vessel.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-31 02:58:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Percutaneous balloon angioplasty is a technique for restoring blood flow through an artery that has become narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis. A small balloon is inserted into the artery and inflated, thus rupturing the atheromatous plaque, stretching the smooth muscle cells within the middle of the vessel and widening the arterial lumen. Angioplasty is particularly effective in the iliac vessels, but the technique is also successful for treating femoropopliteal arteries. Two year patency rates for femoropopliteal disease is around 80% (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2013</LINK>). Five year patency rates for iliac and femoropopliteal angioplasty are 50% to 60% and 52% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Adar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adar 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Long-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 1995</LINK>). More recent studies suggest a five year patency rate in the iliac artery of around 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Leville-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leville 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Park-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important cause of failure after angioplasty is myointimal hyperplasia, which is the unrestricted migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells into the vessel lumen leading to narrowing of the vessel and restriction of blood flow. The stimulus for this cellular migration is unclear and therapeutic approaches are being sought to regulate this process (<LINK REF="REF-Clowes-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clowes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dilley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dilley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mintz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sottiurai-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sottiurai 1983</LINK>). Myofibroblasts of the adventitia also contribute to the process of vascular lesion formation (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) is a technique that is intended to suppress cellular proliferation and migration by directing radiation at the site of the vascular intervention. IVBT is based on the concept that proliferating smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts are more sensitive to the effects of low doses of radiation than non-proliferating cells (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 1996</LINK>). It allows a localised delivery of radiation to inhibit the proliferative response seen after angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-31 03:11:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although two forms of radiation are commonly used for IVBT (gamma and beta), both have limitations when used in peripheral vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 1997</LINK>). Beta sources produce high-energy particle radiation which rapidly loses activity over short distances of the vessel wall. This limited penetration means that in order to guarantee that the entire arterial wall receives an equal dose, particularly with larger peripheral vessels, it is essential that the radiation source be centred in the lumen of the vessel. By comparison, electromagnetic gamma-radiation penetrates well beyond the vessel wall, thus removing the degree of precision that is required with beta-radiation. However, this increased penetration increases the risk of potential damage to surrounding tissues and, therefore, increases the oncogenic (cancer causing) potential of the intervention. Gamma-radiation also requires more elaborate and costly radiation protection measures for the operators. Both types of radiation can be delivered by either intravascular insertion of a catheter containing the radiation source in a balloon (beads, gel, liquid) or a wire source where the tip of the wire is radioactive. These sources are placed in the target vessel for a calculated period of time to deliver the required dose (<LINK REF="REF-Nath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nath 1999</LINK>). Alternative methods for delivering the radiation involve the insertion of a permanent low-activity radioactive stent with a radioactive half-life tailored to the purpose, for example phosphorus-32, with vanadium-48 and yttrium-90 considered as alternatives (<LINK REF="REF-Feres-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feres 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanefeld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanefeld 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rorat-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rorat 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Extensive work on animals has confirmed the inhibition of acute and late restenosis by IVBT and, more importantly, reported a low incidence of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hehrlein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hehrlein 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiedermann-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedermann 1994</LINK>) thereby providing the impetus for human trials. Much of our understanding of IVBT has been gathered from studies of radiotherapy in coronary arteries. Published trials in coronary arteries have been uniformly optimistic. The first published trial of coronary artery IVBT was by Condado et al (<LINK REF="REF-Condado-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condado 1995</LINK>) in Venezuela who treated 21 participants with gamma-irradiation after balloon angioplasty. Although two participants had immediate failures, none of the 19 remaining participants showed evidence of late occlusion at the two year angiographic follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Condado-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condado 1999</LINK>). The Coronary Radiation to Inhibit Proliferation Post Stenting (SCRIPPS) study showed similarly impressive results (<LINK REF="REF-Teirstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teirstein 1997</LINK>). At three years, restenosis was nearly twice as common in the control group as in the brachytherapy group (64% versus 33%) (<LINK REF="REF-Teirsten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teirsten 2000</LINK>), a trend reproduced by several subsequent trials (<LINK REF="REF-King-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mintz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 2000a</LINK>). IVBT has also been shown to have a profound effect on vascular remodelling in coronary arteries. Studies have demonstrated increases in initial luminal volume of almost 50% in arteries treated with gamma or beta-radiation (<LINK REF="REF-Condado-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condado 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabate 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the initial benefits of IVBT appear to be very promising, the long-term consequences remain unknown. For example, the longest running trial has published results that follow-up participants for only eight years (<LINK REF="STD-Liermann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liermann 1998</LINK>). No evidence of clinical nerve damage or local malignancy has been observed. However, early trials in coronary IVBT exposed a high incidence of late thrombosis, approaching 6.2% to 6.6%, in participants treated with IVBT (control participants showed an incidence of 0.7% to 0.8%) and this was significantly higher in participants who underwent simultaneous stent insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teirsten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teirsten 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 2000b</LINK>). Treatment with radioactivity delays re-endothelisation of inserted stents and may induce endothelial dysfunction causing arterial spasm (<LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virmani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virmani 1999</LINK>). High dose radiation is also known to induce thrombosis, perhaps by increasing platelet activation whilst inhibiting mechanisms involved in resolution (the physiological process by which the body repairs itself to become as close to the normal state as possible) (<LINK REF="REF-Salame-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salame 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vodovotz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vodovotz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waksman-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waksman 1999b</LINK>). The US Federal Drug Agency (FDA) reviewed data from several trials in relation to this complication (<LINK REF="REF-Sapirstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapirstein 2001</LINK>) and concluded that the high incidence in early studies was caused by premature cessation of antiplatelet therapy. Sapirstein et al recommended the avoidance of IVBT with simultaneous stent insertion and suggested the maintenance of antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of six months after IVBT and for one year if a new stent was implanted simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Sapirstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapirstein 2001</LINK>). In general, all patients with PAD should be permanently on antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-Mannava-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannava 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fibrosis of irradiated vessels may weaken vessel walls, while initially favourable adaptive remodelling could lead to late aneurysm formation (<LINK REF="REF-Condado-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Condado 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabate 1999</LINK>). The combined effect of these processes could be exacerbated by asymmetric centring of the radiation source during IVBT, which could lead to some areas of the wall receiving a much higher dose of radiation than others.</P>
<P>There is also evidence that low dose radiation could stimulate myointimal hyperplasia (proliferation of cells into the innermost layer of vessels, particularly at the edges of stents. This leads to a characteristic luminal narrowing phenomenon known as the 'candy-wrapper' or edge effect (<LINK REF="REF-Albiero-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albiero 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eising-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eising 2001</LINK>). The luminal narrowing phenomenon can be reduced in coronary arteries by using a longer brachytherapy source (<LINK REF="REF-Bagga-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagga 2005</LINK>). In vitro experiments showed that beta-radiation treatment can alter the reactivity of certain proteins of the vessel wall extracellular matrix and the vessel wall becomes less prone to platelet adhesion resulting in a decrease of thrombus formation (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PAB" TYPE="STUDY">PAB</LINK> (Probucol And Brachytherapy) trial in Switzerland recruited 335 participants in a 2 x 2 factorial design into four groups: PTA alone, PTA + 14 Gy non-centred Ir-192, PTA + probucol, and PTA + probucol + 14 Gy non-centred Ir-192. Stenting was allowed and only claudicants with de novo femoropopliteal stenoses and occlusions were recruited. All participants received aspirin 100 mg daily and those in whom stents were placed received clopidogrel 75 mg daily. The primary endpoint was restenosis at six month follow-up. Twenty participants from the trial were used in an analysis of the effect of IVBT on vascular lumen dimensions as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at three and 24 months (<LINK REF="REF-Wyttenbach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyttenbach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyttenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyttenbach 2007</LINK>).

<P>The only US based RCT was the Peripheral Artery Radiation Investigational Study (<LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK>), which was completed in 2002. Two hundred and three participants were enrolled to undergo PTA alone or PTA with 14 Gy from a centred Ir-192 source. Although the trial group published their initial feasibility study results (<LINK REF="STD-PARIS-I" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS I</LINK>), disappointingly they have not published the results from the completed RCT. Preliminary results from follow-up of 75 of the participants were presented at the 2003 Annual Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK> trial recruited 100 participants with recurrent stenoses or occlusions of the femoropopliteal vessels resulting in claudication or CLI. The participants were randomised to PTA with or without stenting and with or without 12 Gy from a non-centred Ir-192 source. Information on antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy was not provided. The primary endpoint was restenosis at 12 months follow-up.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK> (VAscular RAdiation) trial from the Netherlands was a multicentre (eight centres) RCT initiated in 1998 where participants with de novo stenoses or occlusions were randomised prior to undergoing initial PTA to receiving IVBT or not. Because of the protocol, 17 participants were excluded immediately leaving 60 participants, 33 controls treated with PTA with and without stenting and 27 treated with additional 14 Gy centred Ir-192. Participants with both claudication and CLI were included. All participants were treated with aspirin 100 mg daily long-term. The primary endpoint was restenosis rate at 12 months follow-up. <LINK REF="REF-Hagenaars-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagenaars 2002</LINK> analysed a subgroup of 24 trial participants to assess vascular lumen dimensions as measured by duplex ultrasound.</P>
<P>After successfully conducting an initial feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of IVBT, in 10 participants with long segment restenosis who underwent non-centred 12 Gy IVBT without complications (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-1" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 1</LINK>), the Vienna group started recruiting in 1996 for the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK> trial in which 113 participants were randomised after PTA to receiving IVBT 12 Gy by a non-centred Ir source or not. Included were de novo and recurrent lesions, both stenoses &gt; 5 cm and occlusions. Participants with claudication and CLI were allowed. All participants received aspirin 100 mg/day (from at least two weeks prior to the procedure and continued indefinitely post-procedure) and heparin therapy for 24 hours peri-procedure. The primary endpoint was angiographic patency at six months. Secondary outcomes included restenosis rates, revascularisation rates, ABI and peak velocity ratios (ratio of peak systolic velocity within the stenosis to peak systolic velocity just prior to the stenosis) as determined by duplex measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>). The group have published an update of the trial with 102 participants completing five year follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfram-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfram 2006a</LINK>). Using a subgroup of 34 participants from this study, <LINK REF="REF-Pokrajac-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokrajac 2002a</LINK> looked at the potential effect of using a non-centred source on restenosis. Trials run by this group following <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK> used a centred source. A very small randomised single centre study performed in 2000 in Salzburg (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann 2002</LINK>) (part of <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>) randomised nine participants with de novo or recurrent lesions of the femoropopliteal vessels to 18 Gy centred Ir-192, or not, post-PTA (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann 2002</LINK>). All participants were treated with aspirin 100 mg daily and heparin peri-procedure. The focus of the publication was on thrombotic sequelae of the procedure. This was an analysis of a subset of participants from a single centre participating in a multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK> multicentre trial in 1998, 134 participants with de novo or recurrent stenoses or occlusions of the femoropopliteal vessels were randomised to receiving PTA with or without 18 Gy via a centred Ir-192 source. Participants requiring stenting were excluded but both claudicants and participants with CLI were included. All participants were treated with aspirin 100 mg daily and heparin. The primary endpoint of the study was arterial patency at 12 months follow-up. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess de novo versus recurrent lesions from participants enrolled in the Vienna 2 and 3 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfram 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Vienna 4 trial was a non-randomised feasibility study of 33 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-4" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 4</LINK>), which was performed prior to enrolment started for the double-blind multicentre <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-5" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 5</LINK> trial. Ninety-four participants were enrolled with de novo or recurrent stenoses or occlusions of the femoropopliteal vessels. All participants underwent PTA and stenting with Wallstent or nitinol stents prior to randomisation to receiving additional 14 Gy from a centred Ir-192 source or not (control). The primary endpoint was restenosis at six months follow-up. All participants were treated with dual aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily therapy and peri-procedural heparin treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Schillinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schillinger 2004</LINK> assessed the effect of IVBT and stenting on acute phase proteins in a small subset of participants from the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-5" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 5</LINK> trials.</P>

None of these pilot or feasibility studies used a control group and they had very small numbers of participants (10 to 45 participants).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bottcher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bottcher 1994</LINK> published his findings on the use of a non-centred Ir-192 gamma source to deliver 12 Gy IVBT to restenoses or reocclusions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) of 13 participants. All participants were stented and the IVBT was performed without incident. They reported that all treated vessels remained patent at three to 27 months follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Liermann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liermann 1998</LINK> reported the outcomes of 40 participants (a previous publication reported on 28 of these participants (<LINK REF="STD-Schopohl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schopohl 1996</LINK>)) treated with 12 Gy from a non-centred Ir-192 source for recurrent stenoses or occlusions of the previously treated SFA segments, with a follow-up period of four months to 7.5 years. They reported freedom from restenosis in 33 of the 40 participants; one participant developed acute thrombosis at three months and another developed restenosis at 12 months. Pichler's group (<LINK REF="STD-Pichler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pichler 1999</LINK>) successfully treated 24 de novo and recurrent lesions in the SFA segment with 14 Gy non-centred Ir-192. At 15 months they reported cumulative patency rates of 60%, with no major adverse events. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Boselli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boselli 2002</LINK> treated the stented SFA segments of 45 participants with non-centred Ir-192. They reported immediate patency rates of 95%, with a 12 month patency of 80%.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kruger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 2002</LINK> performed non-centred IVBT using a Ir-192 source to deliver 12 Gy in six participants with de novo SFA stenoses and gave one participant centred IVBT. They reported restenosis in only one of the seven participants, with follow-up out to four years. Walichiewicz also reported the results of their pilot study, in 2002 (<LINK REF="STD-Walichiewicz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Walichiewicz 2002</LINK>). They treated 20 limbs of 19 participants with 15 Gy Ir-192 applied to de novo stenoses or occlusions of the SFA, with follow-up of one to 14 months. All participants underwent angiographic assessment at follow-up. At six months the trialists observed four (20%) acute thrombotic occlusions and no restenoses, and recommended six months of aggressive antiplatelet therapy with ticlopidine in participants who had stents in situ.</P>
<P>Waksman (<LINK REF="STD-PARIS-I" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS I</LINK>) reported the results of their feasibility pilot study, called PARIS 1, in 2001. They recruited 40 participants with claudication to undergo PTA to their SFA followed by 14 Gy delivered by a centred, specially designed afterloader, with follow-up at six months. The procedure was unsuccessful in five (12.5%) of their cases; two participants dropped out due to complications of PTA and in three the catheter kinked and would not allow passage of the radiation source. Two participants died and four refused angiographic follow-up before the initial assessment at six months. At six month angiographic follow-up the restenosis rate was 17.2% (6/35 participants) and three required revascularisation. At 12 months follow-up the clinical restenosis rate was 13.3% (in 30 participants).</P>
<P>The Vienna group published their initial feasibility study, Vienna 1, looking at 10 participants treated with PTA followed by 12 Gy IVBT from a non-centred Ir-192 source to de novo long SFA restenoses (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-1" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 1</LINK>). The procedure was performed with complications in all participants. At 12 months follow-up they reported a restenosis rate of 40%, with no reocclusions. <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-4" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 4</LINK> reported the results of their second pilot study, Vienna 4, which was designed specifically to include PTA + stenting of the femoropopliteal segment with IVBT using a centred catheter to deliver 14 Gy. Thirty-three participants were successfully treated with no initial adverse events. Restenosis at six months occurred in 30%, with seven participants developing late thrombotic occlusions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pokrajac-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pokrajac 2009</LINK> published a case series using a beta source, strontium-90, for performing IVBT with a CO<SUB>2</SUB>-filling centring balloon to treat 28 participants with either recurrent SFA stenoses or in-stent restenoses, providing 14 to 18 Gy. There were no adverse events and all procedures were successful, with two participants requiring stenting. Reported restenosis rates were 9% at one year, 28% at two years and 40% at three years, with target vessel revascularisation performed in 25%.</P>
<P>In the only reported study of IVBT to the iliac arteries, <LINK REF="STD-Walichiewicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walichiewicz 2003</LINK> reported on 14 participants (15 arteries) treated with PTA with or without stenting and 15 Gy from a centred Ir-192 source. All participants received six months of antiplatelet therapy (ticlopidine) post-procedure. All procedures were successful and at six months the study authors reported one (6.7%) angiographically proven restenosis and one participant with transient limb ischaemia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Werner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 2012</LINK> reported on a non-randomised study evaluating 90 consecutive participants undergoing angioplasty and subsequent endovascular brachytherapy using a dose of 13 Gy at a depth of 2 mm into the vessel wall. Follow-up data continued for up to two years. All procedures were successful in all participants, with one early stent thrombosis but no other complications related to the irradiation. Primary patency was 95.2% and 79.8% at six and 12 months, respectively. The clinical status improved in 67.0% and 62.2% of the participants after six and 12 months, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-LIMBER" TYPE="STUDY">LIMBER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MOBILE" TYPE="STUDY">MOBILE</LINK> were excluded because they were halted and the results never published. <LINK REF="STD-LIMBER" TYPE="STUDY">LIMBER</LINK> aimed to recruit 25 participants who would undergo PTA + IVBT with a 32P beta source applied to femoropopliteal segment lesions, whilst <LINK REF="STD-MOBILE" TYPE="STUDY">MOBILE</LINK> aimed to perform a RCT of 400 participants from the US and Europe with in-stent restenosis of the femoropopliteal segment, with a lesion length of 4 to 30 cm, comparing PTA + stent versus PTA + stent + IVBT using a 32P beta source.</P>

<P>Intravascular brachytherapy presents significant logistical hurdles, making bias difficult to prevent. In order to attempt at least one level of blinding, interpretation of results data ideally should be carried out by members of the team not involved in performing the interventional procedures. However, even this is open to bias as the participants would be aware of which treatment arm they were in.</P>
<P>A sham brachytherapy procedure was performed in several trials in order to blind the participants to the therapy they were undergoing. The sham procedure was performed by placing a dummy wire intravascularly in place of the radioactive source. The following studies used a sham procedure: <LINK REF="STD-Krueger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krueger 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-5" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 5</LINK>.

In <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK> blinding was unclear as the study was not published and was only reported in a meeting.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK>) were at unclear risk of detection bias because details of outcome assessment were not reported.

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-PAB" TYPE="STUDY">PAB</LINK> study there was high risk of bias due to selective reporting as the study authors did not report their secondary outcome of class change according to the Rutherford scale, but instead reported on absence of claudication. Due to the lack of publication of the results of the <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK> study it was unclear if there was any reporting bias.

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PAB" TYPE="STUDY">PAB</LINK> trial used a 2 x 2 factorial design looking at IVBT and probucol. This introduced a potentially high risk of bias as it was not possible to independently compare the main effects of each of the four treatment arms.

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK> study reported the per protocol analysis rather than an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with seven participants crossing from brachytherapy to the control group, which introduced a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK> trial introduced a high risk of bias with an inadequate number to give the study sufficient power, according to the trial report.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Krueger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krueger 2004</LINK> reported that one participant undergoing IVBT developed a thromboembolic occlusion of a lower limb vessel during the procedure, which was immediately treated successfully with thrombolysis. In the <LINK REF="STD-PAB" TYPE="STUDY">PAB</LINK> trial, the standard balloon angioplasty was successful in 89% to 91% of participants in each of the four participant groups, with 24 angioplasty failures (nine occlusions were not crossed; 15 participants failed the angiographic criteria for successful angioplasty) and two cases of an incorrectly placed applicator catheter. The initial phase of the <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK> trial had a procedural success of 35 out of 40 interventions, but no further information was provided for the main trial. In the <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK> trial all initial PTA interventions were successful, but in the IVBT group they had seven technical failures: five due to a missed segment and two due to failure to advance the catheter.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-31 09:24:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen H Welch">
<P>A total of 1090 participants were included in the eight trials.</P>
<P>In this review, patency or restenosis were reported in seven studies. Overall, a statistically significant benefit for IVBT was found for cumulative patency at 24 months (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.10, n = 222). Clinical patency after six and 12 months was not statistically significantly different between the procedures as reported in one study. A statistically significant difference for IVBT was found for restenosis at six months (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.50, n = 562), 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.65; n = 375) and 24 months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78; n = 164). No difference was found after 60 months as measured in one study.</P>
<P>The need for re-interventions was reported in six studies. Target lesion revascularisation was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with IVBT compared with angioplasty alone (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97, P = 0.04) at six months after the interventions. No statistically significant difference between the procedures was found for need for re-intervention at 12 and 24 months after the procedures.</P>
<P>Occlusions were statistically significantly fewer in the control group at more than three months (OR 11.46, 95% CI 1.44 to 90.96, n = 363), but no differences were found after less than one month or 12 months after the procedures.</P>
<P>Limb loss was reported in one trial and showed no statistically significant difference between procedures.</P>
<P>The number of cardiovascular deaths was reported in three studies and showed no statistically significant difference between procedures.</P>
<P>Death from all causes was reported by seven trials at six different time intervals, ranging from six to 60 months, with no statistically significant difference found between interventions.</P>
<P>Complications were reported by seven trials with no statistically significant difference between the interventions.</P>
<P>ABI was reported in two studies and was statistically significant for IVBT only at the 12 month follow-up (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, n = 100). No differences were found between the treatments at the 24 hour and six month intervals.</P>
<P>Pain free walking distance, maximum walking distance on a treadmill and quality of life were similar for the two arms of the trials with no statistically significant difference found between the procedures.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness was not assessed in any of the included studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-31 09:37:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Overall, the benefits of brachytherapy following angioplasty over conventional angioplasty are limited. Use of brachytherapy may be recommended for a medium-term one year reduction in restenosis rate. As the included studies have a variety of outcomes, and time intervals for the outcomes, potentially the data do not represent the whole picture for using brachytherapy for PAD.</P>
<P>The literature search identified only RCTs using the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify RCTs using the iliac arteries, therefore the available evidence cannot be interpreted for arteries other than the femoropopliteal artery.</P>
<P>All included studies compared PTA with and without stenting plus IVBT with PTA with and without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to newer technologies such as drug eluting stents, balloons, or cryoplasty.</P>
<P>The very long-term outcomes (more than 10 years) remain unknown as no data beyond 60 months was identified. However, this may in some respects not be so relevant because of the low survival rate after five years as shown in <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>As well as clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and quality of life will need to be evaluated before brachytherapy can be recommended for widespread use. Limited or no information is available for these outcomes.</P>
<P>Since the publication of the first version of this review, and indeed the publication of many of the included studies, the outcome measures deemed relevant to the success of peripheral vascular interventions have evolved from patency and stenosis to number of re-interventions and quality of life. We have reordered the outcomes of this review update to reflect the importance of the outcomes and current practice. However, we are unable to change the outcomes as reported by the published studies. It is possible that this change in importance of outcome measures over time has affected the findings of this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-31 09:47:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>The quality of the included trials was moderate, with our concerns relating to the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the procedures and the small sample sizes for some studies. Primary outcomes (patency or restenosis and need for re-intervention) were reported in the majority of the trials, but reporting at various time points and the use of multiple definitions of the outcomes by the included studies meant that not all data were available for pooling. The secondary outcomes were not reported in many of the included studies.</P>
<P>The review included trials where brachytherapy was an adjunct to the treatment of participants with PAD or stenosed bypass grafts versus procedures without brachytherapy. The eight included studies involved a total of 1090 participants with PAD who required vascular intervention that could be appropriately managed by IVBT and who were deemed fit to undergo such an intervention. Some of the included studies incorporated small samples and this should be considered when interpreting the findings. The effect estimates for the primary outcomes (primary patency or restenosis, or need for re-intervention at various time points) produced narrow 95% confidence intervals. Together with the absence of heterogeneity between trials these suggest that the findings are robust. However, for the outcomes restenosis at six months, binary restenosis, peak velocity at six months and vessel wall area at 24 hours, where the heterogeneity was more than 50%, the findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>The methods used to conduct the review are described in detail in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Particular strengths are the independent application of the review eligibility criteria, independent data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. Two authors (AA, MS) independently extracted the data. We attempted to identify all relevant studies. Further data and information were obtained for specific outcomes of this review. The studies used individual participants as the unit of analysis.</P>

<P>A review of the Vienna (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-1" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-4" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-5" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 5</LINK>), Frankfurt (<LINK REF="STD-Liermann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liermann 1998</LINK>), PARIS (<LINK REF="STD-PARIS-I" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK>) and Bern (<LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK>) studies concluded that brachytherapy is feasible and effective but could not give brachytherapy a definite role in the prophylaxis of restenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Pokrajac-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokrajac 2002b</LINK>), a result that was similar to our review for long-term restenosis rates.</P>
<P>The use of peripheral artery brachytherapy as an adjunct to PTA for the prevention of restenosis in the femoropopliteal system did provide improved health outcomes in a review of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Krueger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krueger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>) but the study authors did not have enough evidence for the role of brachytherapy for the prevention of restenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Technology-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Technology 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gorenoi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorenoi 2009</LINK> reviewed intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) in people with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and found that the use of brachytherapy after successful balloon dilatation showed a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis at six and 12 months (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84) and a significant delay in the time to recurrence of restenosis (17.5 versus 7.4 months, P &lt; 0.01). The low restenosis result is similar to the low restenosis at six and 12 months in this systematic review. <LINK REF="REF-Gorenoi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorenoi 2009</LINK> also showed an estimated additional cost of approximately EUR 1700 for brachytherapy to be used as an adjuvant to other treatments such as balloon dilatation, PTA with an optional stent, or after stenting.</P>
<P>A systematic review and meta-analysis of endovascular brachytherapy looked at restenosis following lower limb angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2012</LINK>). The review included six trials, three of which (<LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK>) were included in our current systematic review with the same name while two other trials were included under different names (Cologne: <LINK REF="STD-Krueger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krueger 2004</LINK>; Bern: <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK>) and one was an update on a trial (Paris: <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-I" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PARIS-II" TYPE="STUDY">PARIS II</LINK>). The authors concluded that endovascular brachytherapy cannot be recommended for routine clinical use because it has an increased risk of new lesions and it lacks a reduction in medium to long-term risk of restenosis. Our review determined that at 60 months there was no benefit when using brachytherapy in term of restenosis rate.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the use brachytherapy may increase in the future if beta-emitting sources become more widely available (<LINK REF="REF-Minar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minar 2012</LINK>). Using beta-emitting sources would improve logistics and have technical advantages. An open, non-randomised Limb Ischaemia Treatment and Monitoring post Vascular Brachytherapy to Prevent Restenosis (<LINK REF="STD-LIMBER" TYPE="STUDY">LIMBER</LINK>) trial was halted after recruiting 25 participants, with no results published. The <LINK REF="STD-MOBILE" TYPE="STUDY">MOBILE</LINK> (More Patency with Beta for In-stent Restenosis in the Lower Extremity) trial, the only RCT for femoropopliteal brachytherapy using a beta source, was also halted by the company running it (Novoste) for financial reasons. The low penetration of beta-radiation would require exact centring of the source within the lumen, however the radiation dose to the vessel wall could be more accurately determined. The Vienna group have published an initial feasibility study using the beta source strontium-90 in a CO<SUB>2</SUB>-filled centring catheter to deliver 14 to 18 Gy to recurrent stenoses or in-stent stenoses of the SFA with some success (<LINK REF="REF-Pokrajac-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pokrajac 2009a</LINK>). They reported 100% success for the procedure with no major adverse events and restenosis rates at one, two and three years of 9%, 28% and 40%. A RCT is urgently needed to explore this initial success further.</P>
<P>A systematic review and meta-analysis of additional technologies to enhance angioplasty for infrainguinal PAD looked at restenosis and the need for intervention as outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2013</LINK>). This review included four studies which looked at brachytherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Diehm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK>) as an additional technology to angioplasty. Of these four studies, <LINK REF="REF-Diehm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 2005</LINK> was a pooled subanalysis from the <LINK REF="STD-PAB" TYPE="STUDY">PAB</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Swiss" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss</LINK> trials. When compared with PTA alone, IVBT had a significant effect with low restenosis rates at 12 months as shown by three studies (<LINK REF="REF-Diehm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-3" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 3</LINK>), but no significant effect at six months when two studies were considered (<LINK REF="STD-VARA" TYPE="STUDY">VARA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-2" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna 2</LINK>).<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-31 10:06:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>The evidence for using peripheral artery brachytherapy as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in maintaining patency and for the prevention of restenosis and other clinically relevant outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQOL) and limb salvage in people with peripheral vascular disease is limited, mainly due to the inconsistencies of assessment and reporting of clinically relevant outcomes. In particular, more data on long-term outcomes and comparisons with other techniques such as drug eluting balloons and stents, together with health economics and cost-effectiveness data, are required before the procedure could be recommended for widespread use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-31 10:10:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Longer-term follow-up in currently running and future trials is essential if the potential short and long-term complications and durability of this adjuvant therapy are to be properly evaluated. Future studies should aim to apply standardised outcomes and have complete reporting of findings. Angioplasty with adjuvant brachytherapy can be extended to other sites such as renal or carotid arteries. Brachytherapy should be studied with other technologies such as drug eluting balloons and drug eluting stents. HRQOL should be included and it will allow more detailed cost-effectiveness analyses to be done.</P>

<P>The primary and secondary outcomes have been reordered to reflect the clinical importance of the outcomes and current practice in PAD. Two outcomes listed in previous versions of this review have been removed (grading of patency and time to restenosis) because they were deemed no longer relevant, the outcome bleeding has been added.</P>
