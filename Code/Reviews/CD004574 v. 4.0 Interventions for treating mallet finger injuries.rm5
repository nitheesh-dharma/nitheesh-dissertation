<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury. Typically the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of a finger tendon or a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone. Treatment commonly involves immobilising the finger-end in a splint for six or more weeks. Surgery may be used for more severe injuries.</P>
<P>Four randomised trials were included in the review. These involved a total of 278, mainly adult, participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. The methods of all four trials were flawed leading to concerns about bias. There was no pooling of data.</P>
<P>Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found less treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom-made splint. A second trial found there were fewer complications in participants treated with a padded aluminium-alloy malleable finger splint. However, the incidence of treatment failure was similar in the two treatment groups of this trial. The third trial evaluated the Abouna splint and found a similar incidence of treatment failure in the two groups. However, the Abouna splint often needed replacing due to disintegration of its rubber cover and rusting of the exposed wires and was also less popular with participants.</P>
<P>The fourth trial in the review found no significant differences between participants whose mallet finger was treated with Kirschner wire fixation and those with a Pryor and Howard splint. Similar numbers had complications in the two groups.</P>
<P>The review concluded that there was not enough evidence to show which is the best way to treat mallet finger injury. It noted, however, that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury of the extensor tendon mechanism. Treatment commonly involves splintage of the finger for six or more weeks. Less frequently, surgical fixation is used to correct the deformity.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different, either custom-made or off-the-shelf, finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-07 15:54:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The terminal bone of each finger, the distal phalanx, can be moved downwards (flexed) towards the palm via a flexor tendon or upwards (extended) via an extensor tendon. A sudden forced flexion of the extended finger, for instance when the fingertip is struck by a ball, can result in the disruption of this extensor tendon mechanism. In some cases, the extensor tendon ruptures or tears at or near its insertion on the distal phalanx ('soft-tissue mallet' injury). In other cases, an avulsion (pull-off) fracture occurs at the insertion of the extensor tendon on the distal phalanx ('bony mallet' injury). As a result of these injuries, the fingertip cannot be actively straightened out. Hyperextension of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal or PIP joint) of the finger may also occur. The resulting deformity (extension lag) or droop occurring at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is commonly called mallet finger. Other terms such as 'baseball finger' and 'drop finger' are also in use. Mallet finger injury is also referred to as a zone I injury in terms of the morphology (structure) of the extensor tendon mechanism.</P>
<P>Though the injury can be caused by a ball, including a baseball, the majority of mallet finger injuries result from other non-sports activities at work and at home. For example, stubbing a finger during bed-making in pre-duvet Scotland was highlighted as an important cause by <LINK REF="REF-Robb-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 1959</LINK>. The underlying forces or mechanisms causing the trauma are also varied and may be quite mild or 'trivial', such as those incurred in pulling on socks, in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK>). The presentation of mallet finger is also variable. For instance, finger deformity occurring several days after crushing injuries was reported by <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK>.</P>
<P>The sex, age and affected finger distribution of mallet finger seems to vary with the population under study (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1999</LINK>). Generally, however, it is more common in males. The injury tends to result from significant trauma in males, particularly in younger adults, and more minor trauma in older females (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK> found the middle finger was most often involved, followed by the little finger. The little and ring fingers were most frequently involved in <LINK REF="REF-Robb-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 1959</LINK> and the little finger in <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1988</LINK>. Involvement of the index finger is less common; that of the thumb is rarer still. Around two thirds of the injuries occur in the dominant hand (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of mallet finger injuries are 'closed' in that the overlying skin remains intact; injuries with superficial grazing usually come into this category also. Open injuries resulting in mallet deformity involve high energy trauma or more direct injury, such as laceration, over or near the DIP joint. Following the classification given by <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1999</LINK>, our main focus in this review is on the most common type (type I) of mallet finger injuries, which are those resulting from closed or blunt trauma where the tendon is damaged with either no fractures or with a small avulsion fracture. Types II, involving rupture of the tendon near or at the DIP joint, and III, involving deep abrasion of the tissues, are open injuries. Type IV injuries cover trans-epiphyseal (growth plate) fracture in children and fractures involving a large (20% and above) part of the joint surface in adults.</P>
<P>Treatment of mallet finger injury is generally non-surgical or conservative, and usually involves splinting of the DIP joint in hyper (excess) extension for around six to eight weeks. This positioning of the finger joints acts to relax the tendon and bring the torn ends or fracture fragments closer together thus promoting healing. This is usually followed by overnight splintage for around a month. The materials (plaster, plastic, aluminium) and design of the splints vary; developments often aiming to enhance convenience of application and use, comfort and tolerability, and to avoid complications. Surgical treatment is usually reserved for open or more severe injuries. It can involve the direct repair of the tendon and fracture reduction and fixation (after clean up of the wound for open injuries) or, after reducing the deformity, transfixing the DIP joint with a K-wire (Kirschner wires - smooth pins) to counteract the deforming force of the flexor tendon that bends the DIP joint, or a combination of both methods. Fracture fixation is usually via either mini screws, K-wire augmented by a suture or tension band wiring using stainless steel wire. Arthrodesis (surgical fusion) of the DIP joint in full extension may be done as a last measure.</P>
<P>The main factors potentially influencing the choice of treatment, and outcome, are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>patient characteristics such as skeletal maturity, occupation and which digit is injured;</LI>
<LI>type of injury: open versus closed; size of fracture fragment; partial or complete tear of tendon; epiphyseal injury;</LI>
<LI>time since injury: acute (within 10 days); delayed presentation (one to two months); or chronic or recurrent, or both;</LI>
<LI>degree of loss of extension;</LI>
<LI>degree of functional disability, pain and inconvenience;</LI>
<LI>previous treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Complications of conservative treatment are mostly skin related, such as dorsal ulceration of skin over the DIP joint, and are generally transient (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1988</LINK>). Treatment failure, as well as an untreated mallet finger, can result in persistent extension lag (loss of voluntary full extension) and swan neck deformity (severe flexion deformity of DIP joint plus a secondary hyperextension deformity of the PIP joint resulting from an imbalance in the extensor mechanism). Complications of surgical treatment are common and more serious. These include infection, injury to the nail bed resulting in nail deformity, joint incongruity, skin necrosis and limitation of flexion of the DIP joint.</P>
<P>In 1998, Geyman et al published a systematic review on conservative versus surgical treatment of mallet finger (<LINK REF="REF-Geyman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geyman 1998</LINK>). Our review, which is confined to treatment comparisons conducted within randomised trials, also evaluates both conservative and surgical interventions.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aimed to determine the most appropriate treatment for mallet finger injuries. Our prime focus was the typical mallet finger injury: namely, acute closed soft-tissue or bony mallet finger injury in skeletally mature persons. Where possible, we planned to conduct separate analyses for closed soft-tissue bony mallet injuries, closed bony mallet injuries, open injuries, injuries (usually involving epiphyseal fractures) in children, fractures involving over 20% of the joint (articular) surface and injuries with delayed, including chronic, presentation. </P>
<P>We set out to test the following broad hypotheses both for the overall group and, where possible, for comparable injury groups.</P>
<P>There are no differences in outcome between different methods of conservative treatment, including no treatment.</P>
<P>There are no differences in outcome between surgical and conservative treatment.</P>
<P>There are no differences in outcome between different methods of surgical treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Any randomised or quasi-randomised (for example, allocation by date of birth or alternation) controlled trials which compare interventions, including no intervention, for the treatment of mallet finger injuries.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients of any age with mallet finger injury or deformity as described in the 'Background'. The potential for misdiagnosis, such as a missed bony mallet, was considered in trials in which the method of diagnosis was unspecified or based on physical examination alone (and thus not X-rayed). We planned to exclude trials focusing on the treatment of similar deformities resulting from disease, primarily rheumatoid arthritis.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Conservative and surgical interventions, as presented in the 'Background', used in the treatment of mallet finger injuries. Though plaster casts have generally been replaced by various types of splints, some of which are commercially available such as the Stack splint (<LINK REF="REF-Stack-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stack 1986</LINK>), trials evaluating plaster casting would have been included if these had been identified.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We sought the following outcome measures:<BR/>(1) recovery defined as return to pre-injury level of pain-free function of the finger, and time to recovery;<BR/>(2) persistent extension lag, including subsequent remedial surgery;<BR/>(3) persistent pain;<BR/>(4) persistent finger stiffness;<BR/>(5) inconvenience and complications of treatment;<BR/>(6) long-term complications such as osteoarthritis and swan neck deformity;<BR/>(7) range of finger motion;<BR/>(8) patient adherence to treatment;<BR/>(9) costs.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 1 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008 week 11), CINAHL (1982 to March week 1 2008), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (1985 to March 2008), PEDro - physiotherapy evidence database (http://www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au/index.html accessed 18 March 2008) and OTseeker - The Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence Database (http://www.otseeker.com accessed 18 March 2008). The search term 'mallet' was used for both PEDro and OTseeker. Additionally, both databases were searched using the search term 'finger', respectively limited to body part 'hand or wrist' in PEDro and diagnosis/ subdiscipline 'hand or upper limb condition / injury / procedure' in OTseeker. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
<P>In MEDLINE (OVID WEB) the subject specific search strategy was combined with all three stages of the optimal trial search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). The full search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE are shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; and strategies for <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Wiley InterScience), CINAHL and AMED are included in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>We also searched Current Controlled Trials at http://www.controlled-trials.com (accessed March 2008) and the archive of the UK National Research Register at https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/NRRArchiveSearch.aspx (database based on records up to September 2007) for ongoing and recently completed trials.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-02 10:59:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both review authors assessed potentially eligible trials for inclusion. We sought further information from trialists of incompletely published or unpublished trials to ascertain their status. Titles of journals, names of authors or supporting institutions were not masked at any stage. Both authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies and extracted the data. All disagreements and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.<BR/> <BR/>Attempts were made to contact trialists of the included trials for additional details of key items of trial methodology or data.</P>
<P>A modification of the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group quality assessment tool was used in the evaluation of the included studies. The scoring scheme for 12 aspects of trial validity, plus brief coding guidelines for selected items, is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. From the first update (Issue 4, 2005) of the review, the scores of the individual items were no longer summed.</P>

<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Where available and appropriate, we presented quantitative data for outcomes listed in the inclusion criteria graphically. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. No data pooling was possible.</P>
<P>Typically, mallet finger injury occurs to one finger of a patient but, as anticipated in the review protocol, two or more mallet fingers did occur in the same person in some of the trials. We were thus mindful of the potential for unit of analysis problems where such trials presented analyses by fingers rather than by participants (<LINK REF="REF-Sauerland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauerland 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity and subgroup analyses</B>
<BR/>There were insufficient data to perform our planned sensitivity analyses investigating the effects of allocation concealment, assessor blinding and loss to follow up. Similarly, we were unable to carry out our planned separate outcome analyses of: (a) patients with closed soft-tissue versus bony mallet injuries; (b) patients with closed versus open injuries; (c) patients with acute versus delayed or chronic injury; (d) children; and (e) patients with large articular fractures.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No new studies were identified from the extension of the search from June 2005 to March 2008.</P>
<P>In all, we located six eligible studies, four of which are included and the other two are excluded for reasons given in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>All four included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>) were fully reported in medical journals. Further information was received from the trial investigators of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>). All four trial reports were identified from the specialised register of the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group; three trials were originally found via MEDLINE and the other through bibliographic checking. All the trials were reported in English.</P>
<P>The publication dates of the trial reports span 12 years, from 1982 to 1993. Only <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> gave details of the period of trial recruitment: August 1978 to October 1979. All trials took place in the UK; patients presented to accident and emergency departments in hospitals in four separate UK cities.</P>
<P>The four included studies involved a total of 278 participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. There were no mallet thumb injuries included. The percentage of males ranged from 62% to 71%. The mean ages were between 41 and 46 years in three trials; no age information was provided for <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>. The youngest recorded participant was nine years old (<LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>) and the oldest was 82 (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>); the majority of participants were skeletally mature.</P>
<P>All four trials included both soft-tissue and bony mallet injuries; two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>) gave specific mention of using X-rays for diagnosis purposes.

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-02 10:59:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All four trials were methodologically flawed and generally failed to achieve top scores on most of the individual items of the methodological quality scoring scheme (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the description of items and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for the scores). In particular, there was insufficient information to judge whether allocation was concealed (item A) in <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>, though this trial used numbered sealed envelopes, or in <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>, where no details were given. Allocation was not concealed in <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>, where allocation was based on odd and even hospital numbers. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>, where it is likely that no participants were lost to follow up, there was insufficient information in the journal reports to confirm that intention-to-treat analysis had been carried out (item B). In particular, the numbers of participants in the two intervention groups at randomisation were not provided in the journal reports of the other three trials. Further problems resulted from unit of analysis problems in <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>, who presented analyses by fingers rather than by participants. However, intention-to-treat analysis was confirmed on the subsequent provision of baseline information for <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was no blinding of outcome assessors (item C), participants or care providers (items E and F). Aside from <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>, baseline characteristics (item D), split by intervention group, of all randomised participants were not presented in the published reports of the other three trials. However, further information received for <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK> led to an increased score for this item.</P>
<P>Additional information provided for <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> indicated comparability of care programmes (item G). There was insufficient information to judge this in the other three trials. Only <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK> gave an adequate description of the intended trial population (item H). None of the trials provided clear descriptions of their interventions (item I) in their trial reports; further information received for <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> led to an increased score for this item.</P>
<P>Though the outcome measures used (item J) were well defined in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>), the quality of outcome measurement in terms of the appropriateness of the measures used (item K) was unsatisfactory in all four trials. This was particularly so in <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>, which, for example, did not mention how finger deformity was measured. Active surveillance (item L) clearly took place in <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>, but the duration of follow up was inadequate in both these trials (9 and 10 weeks respectively). Follow up was over one year for all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> and the majority of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>. However, since active surveillance could not be confirmed in either trial, both scored zero for this item.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The outcomes reported for the included trials are listed in the 'Characteristics of included studies'. As indicated above the quality of outcome measurement was poor in all four trials. Additionally, the results were incomplete for many outcomes and we have been unable to obtain clarification on the results of <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>, who presented their results according to affected fingers rather than individual participants. While quantitative data are presented graphically for some outcomes, this is for illustrative purposes only. No sensitivity or subgroup analysis was possible. In particular, best and worse scenario analyses to test the possible effects on the results of the inclusion of participants lost to follow up was prevented by the lack of baseline numbers in two (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>) of the three trials reporting losses to follow up. Although <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> provided results split by time of presentation since injury, the numbers in each group (up to one week; over one week) were too few to explore this here. </P>
<P>The disparity in comparisons of the four included trials precluded pooling of data.</P>
<P>
<B>Different methods of conservative treatment</B>
<BR/>Although the standard Stack splint was the 'control' group in all three trials comparing different types of splint, there are distinct differences in the characteristics of the 'intervention' splints under test. Thus, each trial is reviewed separately.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Perforated custom-made splint versus Stack splint </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK>)<BR/>There were significantly fewer cases of treatment failure, defined as need to change splint type and/or excessive lag deformity, in the perforated splint group (2/27 versus 9/27). There was one change of splint type (from the perforated splint to Stack splint) in the perforated splint group due to skin irritation. In contrast, six participants in the Stack splint group changed to using the perforated splint. All six participants had had difficulty removing and reapplying their splint for hygiene purposes. Two of these participants had dorsal ulcers and two had skin maceration. Overall, there were more complications reported in the Stack splint group (1/27 versus 4/27). There was no mention of the use of a goniometer in the trial report, neither were the criteria for grading "lag" deformity made explicit nor when the measurements took place. If excessive lag deformity is taken as greater than or equal to 25 degrees, then there was one case reported in the perforated splint group and four in the Stack splint group. The ability of participants to change their splint was assessed and reported as percentages (84% versus 79%); <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK> failed to provide the actual numbers of participants in the two groups and thus we could not determine the actual numbers who were unable to change their splint satisfactorily.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Padded aluminium-alloy malleable finger splint versus Stack splint </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>)<BR/>At nine-weeks follow up, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the treatment failure defined according to Abouna and Brown criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Abouna-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abouna 1968</LINK>): extension loss greater than 15 degrees; finger stiffness or impaired flexion, or both. Similar numbers of participants in the two groups were reported as having stiffness of either the distal or proximal phalangeal joints. There was no mention of how finger stiffness was assessed. Significantly fewer participants in the custom-made splint group had skin complications (2/30 versus 10/30). These comprised one case of dorsal ulcer and one of skin maceration in the test splint group and three cases of dorsal ulcer, six of skin maceration and one tape allergy in the Stack splint group. There was no indication of whether any of these led to the premature splint removal or other treatment. One quarter of each group was reported as having taken time off work but there was no information on how many worked.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Abouna splint versus Stack splint </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK>)<BR/>Unlike the two custom-made splints tested above, the Abouna splint was supplied externally and its development predated the Stack splint. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the treatment failure at 10 weeks, defined according to Abouna and Brown criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Abouna-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abouna 1968</LINK>). However, twice as many participants in the Abouna group expressed dissatisfaction with their splint (21/49 versus 10/57). This probably reflected the tendency for the rubber coating of the Abouna splint to perish allowing the bare wire to rust and mark clothes. In three participants, the bare wire caused skin laceration and there was a need for at least one replacement of the original splint during treatment in 20 of the participants allocated the Abouna splint. No person allocated a Stack splint had skin laceration or required a new splint.</P>

<B>
<I>Kirschner wire fixation versus Pryor and Howard splint </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>)<BR/>Treatment failure, measured between 14 and 18 months follow up and defined according to the Stark (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1962</LINK>) criteria (based on pain and deformity), was less frequent in the surgical fixation group (1/19 versus 4/22). The same results were obtained for participants with "unchanged" range of active movement at the distal phalangeal joints. No participants had restriction of movement at the proximal phalangeal or metacarpo-phalangeal joints. In the splint group, one person was dissatisfied with the result of their treatment and two indicated they had restricted function of their finger. There were similar numbers of participants with complications in the two groups: two surgical group participants had infected fingers, in one case the wire was removed after two weeks; three splint group participants had severe local skin irritation, all recovered after removal of their splint. No participant had tenderness or deformity of the terminal nail or pulp. Auchincloss recalled that all participants were compliant. At late follow up, one surgical group participant and three splint group participants expressed dissatisfaction with their method of treatment.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 15:58:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Despite a comprehensive search for trials, we identified only five published trials and one registered trial. It is possible that we failed to identify other studies; such as unpublished studies, perhaps reported only in conference proceedings. We suggest that even if this is the case, it is unlikely that their quality and size would have been markedly different from the four included trials. These four trials were small, heterogeneous, inadequately described and reported by today's standards, and had methodological flaws. Ultimately, they provide very little reliable evidence on which to base clinical decisions. It is worth examining some of the underlying reasons for this conclusion, particularly as it could inform future trials.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A key underlying problem is that these were all small trials and losses to follow up further reduced their capacity for producing definitive answers. In general, small numbers of trial participants result in a greater potential for random error or chance findings and, in particular, any apparent comparability of results of interventions tested within such trials should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect or no difference.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>As described in the 'Background', mallet finger injury covers a broad spectrum of injury and there are many factors that could potentially influence outcome. This was recognised in the trials, but only to some extent. For example, in the exclusion of patients presenting with open injuries or three days from their injury in <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK>. The variation in participant and injury characteristics of the trial populations points to the need for much larger sample sizes and for effective randomisation methods to balance potential and actual confounders (factors other than the trial interventions that could influence the trial results). Failure to describe the intended and actual trial populations is also unhelpful when interpreting trial findings.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Lack of allocation concealment and assessor blinding, and failure to perform intention-to-treat analyses are all recognised as serious faults in RCTs that could seriously bias their findings. Unit of analysis problems in trials randomising by participants, some of whom had two or more mallet finger injuries, but presenting analyses by fingers can also distort trial findings. The conduct and quality of reporting of these trials in some regards reflects their vintage. The design of any future trial should include measures to avoid these sources of systematic bias. Similarly, reporting should conform to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Doing this would have avoided the lack of information on the method of randomisation and the incomplete information on the participant flow (particularly, baseline numbers) in the included trials.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Trials should provide a clear description of the interventions and care programmes. We suggest that any such description should include brief details on the advice and instruction provided on skin hygiene and splint removal. Such details aid interpretation of the validity and applicability of trial results. This applies likewise to outcome assessment through active surveillance, ideally of six months or longer, using validated outcome measures. Future trials can take advantage of the advances in outcome measurement for hand disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Bindra-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bindra 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heras_x002d_Palou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heras-Palou 2003</LINK>). We suggest that outcome assessment should also include patient adherence and use of resources (including clinician time).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Questions of validity aside, there remains the question of how applicable the trial comparisons and settings are to current practice. In particular, we are not sure if the Abouna splint is still produced, though we have located one "spring" mallet splint in a supplier list. The design of the basic Stack splint may differ slightly between different suppliers, different trials, and then and now. Lastly, all four trials were conducted in accident and emergency settings in the UK.</P>
<P>
<B>Different methods of conservative treatment</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Perforated custom-made splint versus Stack splint</B>
</I>
<BR/>The rationale behind the development of the perforated splint in <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK> was the avoidance of the need for splint removal for skin hygiene purposes. <LINK REF="STD-Kinninmonth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinninmonth 1986</LINK> found around one fifth of the participants were unable to remove and reapply their splints properly; this included the four participants in the Stack splint group with skin maceration or ulceration. The inadequate description of trial methods and results for this trial prevent us drawing any conclusions on the relative effectiveness of the two splints in resolving mallet finger. Given the inherent problem of losing the benefit of splintage if one flexes the finger during cleaning, proper instruction and advice for the correct procedure is necessary for patients. We do not know how much of a problem is patients' lack of comprehension and non-adherence to these instructions and to keeping on the splint for six or more weeks; this was not mentioned in the other trial reports, though Auchincloss (<LINK REF="REF-Auchincloss-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auchincloss 2003</LINK>) recalled no problems with compliance in his trial (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>). Clearly, treatment would have to be adapted for patients unable to understand instructions or to perform their own hygiene.</P>

<I>
<B>Padded aluminium-alloy malleable finger splint versus Stack splint</B>
</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK> attempted to get a better fit and avoid skin maceration with their padded aluminium-alloy malleable finger splint. Though the results for correcting the mallet finger deformity were reported as similar, there are insufficient data and an inadequate follow up of just nine weeks to conclude that the two splints were of equal effectiveness. Significantly fewer participants in the custom-made splint group had skin complications. However the proportion of skin complications in the Stack splint group of <LINK REF="STD-Maitra-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maitra 1993</LINK> was higher than in the other two trials using the Stack splint (33% versus 15% versus 0%). There was also no mention of the skin hygiene regimen used.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Abouna splint versus Stack splint<BR/>
</B>
</I>In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Warren-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warren 1988</LINK> tested another off-the-shelf splint, the Abouna splint. Nearly half the participants of each treatment group were assessed as treatment failures. Whether the similarity in these results is a true result cannot be answered here. However the greater unpopularity of the Abouna splint, probably reflecting its suboptimal performance during usage, is an important finding. The perishable rubber and rusting of the exposed wires and the frequent need for replacement splints reveal that the Abouna splint, in the form available to the trialists, is an inferior design to the Stack splint.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical versus conservative treatment</B>
<BR/>There were no statistically significant differences between participants whose mallet finger was treated with Kirschner wire fixation and those using the Pryor and Howard splint in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK>). In the absence of baseline data, we were unable to perform sensitivity analyses to examine the possible effects of the loss of nine participants (18%) from follow up. Subgroup analysis based on time from injury was also inappropriate, even though separate data were provided in <LINK REF="STD-Auchincloss-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Auchincloss 1982</LINK> for those presenting within and after one week of injury. Though, essentially, all the injuries were acute, there was a wide spectrum of injuries included in the trial. It is possible that surgical fixation is preferable for some types of mallet finger injury but, in the absence of information on when surgery is indicated and given the risk of serious complications resulting from surgery, it seems prudent to opt for primary conservative treatment for a typical mallet finger injury.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different, either custom-made or off-the-shelf, finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury, or indeed, whether the end result of splintage is better than no treatment at all. Similarly, there was insufficient evidence to determine when surgery is indicated.</P>
<P>Until there is reliable evidence to the contrary, the continued use of the off-the-shelf but suitably fitted Stack mallet splint, or equivalent, for the majority of patients (i.e. those with acute closed soft-tissue or bony mallet finger injury) seems appropriate. Patients must be properly instructed on the safe removal and reapplication of the finger splint for skin hygiene purposes. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-07 15:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>While there is considerable scope for good-quality sufficiently-sized and well-reported randomised trials in this area, we suggest such research would be informed by the following.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A fuller description of the epidemiology, including type of injury and current treatment, of this 'common' condition.</LI>
<LI>A clearer idea of outcome of typical treatment for typical (the majority) mallet finger injury. In particular, the extent and nature of treatment failure (assessed in terms of: serious complications resulting in the abandonment of splintage, of failure to sufficiently correct the impairment to enable pain-free return to previous activities and function, of persistent unchanged extension lag, serious longer-term deformity such as swan-neck deformity and functional deterioration of finger, and need for secondary treatment for a chronic mallet finger).</LI>
<LI>A clearer idea of patient satisfaction, preferences and adherence to the treatment protocol.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These should help to show the extent of the problems of, and need for change to, current practice and help to identify the important issues that need addressing. New designs of splints, provided these are shown to be robust enough for everyday use, should always be compared within a randomised trial with the current standard splint. Some guide to the design, conduct and reporting of such trials is provided in the 'Discussion' of this review.</P>
