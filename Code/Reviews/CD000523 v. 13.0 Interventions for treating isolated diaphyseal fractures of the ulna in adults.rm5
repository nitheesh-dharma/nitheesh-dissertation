<TITLE>Interventions for treating adults with an isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-03-23 07:35:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ulna is one of the two bones of the forearm. Isolated fractures of the shaft of the ulna, without other fractures, often result when the forearm is raised to fend off a blow. Such fractures are fairly rare, but can result in significant disability. Most people are treated in outpatients with plaster casts or arm braces. Some are treated surgically. Surgery generally involves the re-alignment and fixation of the broken ends of the bone.</P>
<P>Four trials, involving a total of 237 participants, were included in the review. These trials had methodological weaknesses that could have resulted in serious bias. One trial compared 'short arm' (splintage stopping below the elbow) pre-fabricated functional braces with 'long arm' (splintage includes the elbow) plaster casts. It found no clear difference between the two groups in the time taken for the fracture to heal. However, significantly more people in the brace group were satisfied with their treatment and significantly more returned to work during their treatment. One trial compared Ace Wrap elastic bandage, short arm plaster cast and long arm plaster cast. The large loss to follow-up in this trial makes any findings tentative. However, the need for replacement of the Ace wrap by other methods due to pain does indicate the potential for a serious problem with this intervention. The third trial, which compared immediate mobilisation versus short arm plaster cast versus long arm plaster cast for minimally displaced fractures, found no clear differences in outcome between these three interventions. The fourth trial found no significant differences in functional or anatomical outcomes nor complications between the two types of plates used for surgical fixation of the fracture.</P>
<P>Overall, there was not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to show which methods of treatment are better for these injuries.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-26 12:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-04-26 12:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Isolated fractures of the shaft of the ulna are often sustained when the forearm is raised to shield against a blow. The energy is then absorbed by the subcutaneous ulna resulting in the characteristic 'nightstick' type fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Atkin-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkin 1995a</LINK>). (A nightstick is an American policeman's truncheon.) This type of fracture frequently occurs in young males involved in violent activities (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Toit-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Toit 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epidemiological data on the incidence of this injury is difficult to locate, probably as most of these fractures are treated on an outpatient basis. Initially in the absence of accessible general information, one of us (Pearce) examined his local hospital database at the time and found that the Friarage Hospital, Northallerton, a small District General Hospital in rural Northern England which serves a population of 122,000, had a total of 26 cases of isolated fracture of the ulna in 1997. Most of these injuries were a result of direct violent or high energy impact and many involved incidents with cattle or horses. This figure gives a local incidence rate of 0.2 per 1000 population. This agrees with the general impression of low incidence but it is not known how this figure compares nationally or internationally. Subsequently, we located a report of an epidemiological study of people over 14 years of age with fractures of the radius and ulna presenting to the Orthopaedic Trauma Unit of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, UK, over a three year period starting January 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-McQueen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQueen 2000</LINK>). This unit, which serves a population of around 650,000 meeting the above age criterion, treated a total of 72 cases of isolated fractures of the ulna over the three year period. This gives an annual incidence of approximately 0.04 per 1,000 population, which is a fifth of the rate in Northallerton. Nonetheless, we still anticipate that the incidence is likely to be higher in bigger cities and other areas where violence is more common. <LINK REF="REF-McQueen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQueen 2000</LINK> reported that 38% of the injuries resulted from a direct blow, 31% from a simple fall and 14% from pedestrian road traffic accidents; the mechanism of injury was not stated for the other 17% but none involved sport. Nearly two thirds of the study population was male (63%). The mean age of patients was 43 years; range 18 to 94 years. There was a bimodal distribution of annual age and sex specific incidence; the incidence in males was highest in the youngest age group and tapered off with age, whereas that in females increased gradually for the first few decades and then, reflecting underlying osteoporosis, more dramatically in the elderly.</P>
<P>Although not common, the fracture appears to have a high complication rate, principally non-union, malunion, reduction in the range of wrist and elbow movements, pain and deformity. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1980</LINK> reported a fracture non-union rate of 14%. In a brief review of the results of seven studies of people treated for ulna fracture, <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1983</LINK> reported non-union rates ranging from 1% to 12%, impairment of forearm rotation between 18% to 32% of patients and, for four studies, significant reductions in elbow flexion and extension. A similar picture was conveyed in a review of 33 "series" by <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK>. Such complications may have an effect upon a person's ability to perform their activities of daily living and can prevent them from returning to their previous employment (<LINK REF="REF-Atkin-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkin 1995a</LINK>).</P>

<P>The most suitable method of management of this injury has not been established.

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-04-26 12:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Though isolated ulnar shaft fractures are comparatively rare, there remains a need to establish the best methods to manage these fractures which are often associated with a high rate of complications and, for some, serious limitations in function.

<P>Methodological quality and risk of bias was independently assessed, without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports, by both review authors. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. For our last update (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2009</LINK>), we had continued to use our subject-specific modification of the former generic evaluation tool developed by the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group. We had modified this by replacing the scores 2, 1, 0 respectively by Y (yes, criterion satisfied), ? (unclear or criterion partially satisfied), and N (no, criterion not satisfied). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the grading scheme based on 11 aspects of trial validity, plus brief notes of coding guidelines including the specific scores for items 9, 10 and 11 for the outcome of fracture non-union. Additionally, we independently assessed risk of bias using the tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered patient-rated and clinician-rated outcomes separately in our assessment of blinding and completeness of outcome data. We assessed two additional sources of bias: selection bias resulting from imbalances in key baseline characteristics (age, sex, fracture location, pattern and displacement, and associated soft tissue); and performance bias resulting from lack of comparability in the experience of care providers and provision of treatment interventions such as advice on activity, exercises undertaken, timing of intervention.</P>

<P>Twenty-nine out of the 93 people with forearm fractures recruited into <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2003</LINK> had isolated fracture of the ulna. The two surgeons performing the operations, both of whom were experienced in using both implants, reported similar amounts of ease or difficulty with both implants. The mean operating time was lower in the PC-Fix group (64 versus 78 minutes); this parallels the results for all forearm fractures (78 versus 92 minutes): the latter difference was reported not to be statistically significant. All fractures united but one person in the PC-Fix group and two people in the LC-DCP group had delayed union; all three had had closed fractures (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Precise anatomical reduction of fracture fragments was not achieved in 10 PC-Fix group participants and five LC-DCP group participants (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Two people in the PC-Fix group had pain at follow-up. All participants had "full" range of motion; defined as less than 10% loss of dorsiflexion-palmar flexion of the wrist and less than 25% loss of pronation-supination. Three participants had complications: a deep infection occurred in one person in the LC-DCP group (implant removal was not required); one person in the PC-Fix group had a superficial infection; and one person in the LC-DCP group developed compartment syndrome (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).

<P>Although the absence of strictly comparable interventions and fracture types precluded pooling of data, we found no evidence that cast immobilisation of the elbow offers a short-term advantage in respect of pain relief or fracture union compared with the use of casts or braces which immobilise only the forearm. Participants allocated to a functional forearm brace in <LINK REF="STD-Gebuhr-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gebuhr 1992</LINK> returned to work significantly sooner than those wearing an above elbow cast. The efficacy of an elastic forearm wrap rather than forearm cast immobilisation remains unclear. We found no completed randomised trial comparing surgical versus conservative treatment. Where surgical fixation is considered appropriate, there is no evidence to support any particular implant type.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-26 13:15:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The most common mechanism for these fractures is a direct hit on the forearm and these fractures are often sustained when the forearm is raised to fend off blows or when trying to protect the head. Forty-six per cent of the injuries in <LINK REF="STD-Gebuhr-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gebuhr 1992</LINK> were attributed to violence and the large loss to follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Atkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atkin 1995</LINK> was considered to be a function of the often violent cause of this injury. However, an osteoporotic basis for those fractures that result from a simple fall in older females is also indicated in <LINK REF="REF-McQueen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQueen 2000</LINK>. The majority of fractures in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leemput-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leemput 2007</LINK> were reported as resulting from low trauma, the latter trial attributing all fractures as resulting from a direct hit on the forearm. Despite the differences in location and clear variation in the populations of the included trials, their results are likely to apply more generally.</P>
<P>However, in all three conservative treatment trials, interventions were poorly defined and the absence of strictly comparable interventions and fracture types precluded pooling of data. Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Atkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atkin 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leemput-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leemput 2007</LINK>, reported pain outcomes when comparing a forearm elastic wrap (or compression bandage) with a cast, and came to different conclusions. In <LINK REF="STD-Atkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atkin 1995</LINK>, the majority of participants allocated to an Ace wrap requested a change to another treatment because of pain. In <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leemput-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leemput 2007</LINK>, pain scores showed no significant difference between groups. It is unclear why this should be, but it may reflect the impact of differences in the context in which each study was conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Hawe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawe 2004</LINK>). More data on this comparison would be useful.</P>
<P>While we have not found any randomised trial comparing surgical versus conservative treatment, and thus are unable to define when surgical intervention is indicated, we were able to include a trial comparing two types of plate fixation. <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2003</LINK>, however, was underpowered and the results of both the main trial and those of the subgroup of isolated ulnar shaft fractures, presented in this review, do not reveal statistically significant differences between the two implants. The two plates, both made of titanium, under comparison in this trial are manufactured by the same company and represent interim stages in a sequence of technological developments by the associated AO Research Institute (<LINK REF="REF-Perren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perren 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perren-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perren 2003</LINK>). Further developments in plating technology may preclude the use of these two specific plates in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>), a point discussed in subsequent correspondence on this trial (<LINK REF="REF-Rajasekhar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajasekhar 2004</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-05-06 14:41:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>All four trials included in this review had methodological weaknesses that makes them highly susceptible to bias. Three were quasi-randomised, and there was no assurance of allocation concealment for the only trial that had adequate sequence generation. There was no blinding of outcome assessment, and in <LINK REF="STD-Atkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Atkin 1995</LINK>, almost half the participants were lost to follow-up. The absence of information on loss to follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Van-Leemput-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Leemput 2007</LINK> is a concern.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-03-23 15:26:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>We think that it is unlikely that the review process itself has introduced bias. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, and have reported the potential biases associated with the studies themselves. We believe that publication bias is unlikely; the search was comprehensive, and included the bibliography of a large narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-05-06 14:41:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We found two relevant reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK> provided an useful compilation of the literature and summary of the treatment methods used in studies from the 1950s onwards, and included data from 33 mainly retrospective case reporting the outcomes from 1876 people. Methods used in <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK> for combining the results of groups of people who were given the same treatment were not optimal; for instance, confidence limits were not provided for estimated effects. In addition, although study design and some aspects of study methodology were noted in their appraisal of individual studies, the potential for systematic bias arising from flawed study methodology was not explored or discussed. A formal critique of <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK> may be found in DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) (<LINK REF="REF-DARE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">DARE 2006</LINK>). The quantitative results of <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2000</LINK> should be viewed with caution and should not be taken as the basis for comparisons of effectiveness of the various treatments covered in the review.</P>
<P>A more recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>), which reviewed evidence from randomised studies only, found the same three randomised trials published before 2004 as included in the concurrent version of this review, and reached similar conclusions.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-04-26 15:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-03-24 16:50:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Overall, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for the treatment of isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft in adults. There is, however, weak evidence that in people with minimally displaced isolated fracture of the ulna, cast immobilisation of the elbow may offer no short-term advantage in respect of pain relief or fracture union, and may be associated with longer delay in return to work, when compared with the use of a cast or brace that immobilises only the forearm.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-26 15:18:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Though isolated ulnar shaft fractures are comparatively uncommon there remains a need to establish the best methods to manage these fractures, which are often associated with a high rate of complications and, for some people, significant life changes. The limited information on incidence, and choice, cost, and outcome of treatment, hampers an appraisal of what priority needs to be given to research in this area. However, given that most fractures are treated conservatively and the availability of only weak evidence, the use of splintage and the inclusion or not of the elbow in splintage for minimally displaced fractures appear to be suitable candidates for future randomised trials. All future research should meet robust contemporary standards of design conduct, and reporting, including the use of randomisation methods involving stratification, to ensure baseline equivalence between treatment groups in respect of fracture pattern, location of the fracture, and bone quality.</P>

<P>Author confirmed that some of the 125 people with forearm bone compound fractures resulting from missile injuries had isolated ulnar shaft fractures.

<P>"The specific MEDLINE search, run from 1976 to 1997, in conjunction with the first two levels of the optimal RCT specific search (see 'Search strategy for identification of studies') produced 32 reports of which 13 focused on the management of isolated ulnar fractures, and only two of which were controlled studies and put forward for inclusion. The EMBASE search run from 1981 to 1997 produced 26 studies, of which seven focused on the management of isolated fractures of the ulna, but as none of these were controlled, none were put forward for inclusion. A further two comparative studies (Labbe 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Skinner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skinner 1989</LINK>), both published as abstracts, were identified but were excluded since they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). In their recent response stating that Labbe 1996 was a retrospective study, the trialists added that they were working on an randomised controlled trial investigating the same comparison (percutaneous intramedullary nailing versus plate fixation). A request for further details of this trial will be sent."</P>

<P>"There was no response from Dr Labbe to our request sent September 1998 for further details on the randomised controlled trial which he mentioned in his first response. Neither were there details given in the full report of Labbe 1996 published in 1998 (see Footnote). Correspondence in October 1998 with Dr Lisa Wood, then an orthopaedic registrar based in the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, UK, alerted one of the review authors, Helen Handoll, to the possibility that a comparative study by Goel et al (<LINK REF="STD-Goel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Goel 1991</LINK>) could be a randomised trial. However, since there was no response from the trialists to our inquiries, we have placed this study in the excluded studies category."</P>

<P>"The newly identified trial (<LINK REF="STD-Collinge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Collinge 2000</LINK>), located via handsearching, involved a randomised comparison of open reduction and plating with intramedullary nailing in 36 patients with 37 diaphyseal forearm fractures. Separate data were not presented for the six patients (three in each group) with only an ulnar fracture. Some of these may have been among the 10 patients who were not included in the results. We considered that the sample size was too small to pursue the data for these patients and thus have excluded this trial."</P>
