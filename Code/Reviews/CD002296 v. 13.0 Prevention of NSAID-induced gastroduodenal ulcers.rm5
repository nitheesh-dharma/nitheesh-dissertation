<P>The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors, and double doses of H2-receptor antagonists are effective at reducing the risk of both gastric and duodenal non steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications induced ulcers. In high risk patients, the use of a traditional NSAID + PPI appears equivalent to a COX-2 inhibitor alone. The most effective strategy in high risk GI patients appears to be the combination of a COX-2 inhibitor + PPI.</P>

<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important agents in the management of arthritic and inflammatory conditions, and are among the most frequently prescribed medications in North America and Europe.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-14 06:30:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to May 2009, Current Contents for six months prior to May 2009, EMBASE to May 2009, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1973 to May 2009. Recent conference proceedings were reviewed and content experts and companies were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of prostaglandin analogues (PA), H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper GI toxicity were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-10-14 06:44:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Two independent authors extracted data regarding population characteristics, study design, methodological quality and number of participants with endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall drop-outs, drop outs due to symptoms. Dichotomous data were pooled using RevMan 5.0. Heterogeneity was evaluated using a chi square test, and the I square statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-20 10:34:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-one RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 ug/day was superior to 400 ug/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR 0.17, and RR 0.39 respectively, P=0.0055). A dose response relationship was not seen with duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhoea at all doses, although significantly more at 800 ug/day than 400 ug/day (P=0.0012). Misoprostol also reduced the risk of clinical ulcer complications.</P>
<P>Standard doses of H2RAs were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74) but not gastric ulcers (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08). Both double dose H2RAs and PPIs were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal and gastric ulcers (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74) and RR=0.40;95% CI; 0.32-0.51 respectively for gastric ulcer), and were better tolerated than misoprostol.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-08 21:13:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Misoprostol, PPIs, and double dose H2RAs are effective at preventing chronic NSAID related endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers. Lower doses of misoprostol are less effective and are still associated with diarrhoea. In patients with previous NSAID bleeds, a COX-2 inhibitor alone is equivalent to a tNSAID+PPI, though the re-bleeding rates with both strategies are still relatively high. A strategy of a COX-2 inhibitor+PPI appears to offer the greatest GI safety in high risk patients.</P>

<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important agents in the management of arthritic and inflammatory conditions, and are among the most frequently prescribed medications in North America and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1996</LINK>).

Common side effects such as nausea and dyspepsia correlate poorly with serious adverse GI events (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larkai-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larkai 1987</LINK>). While endoscopic ulcers can be documented in up to 40% of chronic NSAID users (<LINK REF="REF-Stalnikowicz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalnikowicz 1993</LINK>), it is estimated that as many as 85% of these never become clinically apparent (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maetzel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzel 1998</LINK>). Serious NSAID induced GI complications such as haemorrhage, perforation or death are much less common, occurring collectively with an incidence of about 1.5% per year (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>). However, the number of individuals prescribed NSAIDs and the potential for life-threatening adverse events make NSAID toxicity an important clinical and economic problem.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-12 11:32:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the late 1990s, evidence from non-clinical and early clinical trials suggested that the gastrointestinal (GI) safety of the newer cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective NSAIDs may be such that a fundamental change in clinicians&#8217; choice from the use of standard NSAIDs with a gastro-protective agent to monotherapy with a COX-2 selective NSAID (COX-2 inhibitors)  was on the horizon. </P>
<P>However, much has changed since then in the NSAID field. The release of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (COX-2s) brought about significant changes in the NSAID market place. Traditional nonselective NSAIDs (tNSAIDs) prescription numbers fell rapidly, to be replaced by COX-2 prescriptions. Additionally, overall NSAID prescriptions rose in number suggesting that clinicians were starting COX-2s on patients who were not considered candidates for tNSAIDs. The rise of COX-2s continued until 2004 when greater data regarding their cardiovascular and other toxicities became available, leading to the withdrawal of most of these agents from the market over the following years. Non-naproxen tNSAIDs were also suggested to have important cardiovascular toxicity, leading to considerable uncertainty amongst clinicians treating patients with arthritis and other pain disorders as to the choice of agent to use (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-08 21:12:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs are believed to cause gastroduodenal mucosal injury through their inhibition of mucosal prostaglandin production. Prostaglandins promote mucosal integrity through several mechanisms including: maintenance of mucosal blood flow; promoting mucosal bicarbonate formation; promoting mucosal mucus formation; and reducing mucosal acid secretion. Three intervention classes were assessed in this review: misoprostol; H2RAs; and PPIs. H2RAs and PPIs are believed to exert their gastro-protective effects from NSAID gastroduodenal injury through the reduction of gastric acid secretion. Prostaglandin analogues such as misoprostol are believed to exert their gastro-protection by restoring mucosal prostaglandin effects (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-14 05:49:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>NSAIDs are amongst the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide, and are associated with important gastrointestinal harms. The introduction of COX-2's with their greater GI safety resulted in important declines in tNSAID prescriptions. However, with the discovery of cardiovascular (CVS) and other adverse effects associated with COX-2s, practitioners are returning to prescribing tNSAIDs with a gastro-protective agent in an effort to overcome some of the adverse GI effects of tNSAIDs.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-18 00:42:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this study was to systematically review the available literature on the effectiveness of the prostaglandin analogue (PA) misoprostol, H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the prevention of NSAID induced upper GI toxicity, among patients requiring chronic NSAID use. The secondary objectives were to review the effect of these agents on NSAID induced GI symptoms, and to assess the relationship between the effectiveness of PAs at various doses and their associated drug induced adverse events.</P>

<P>Heterogeneity was tested using a Chi-square test with (N-1) degrees of freedom, where N equals the number of trials contributing data. A P value of less than 0.10 was considered evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, heterogeneity was deemed to be present if the I square statistic was greater than 50%. Efforts were made <I>a priori</I> to reduce clinical and statistical heterogeneity by subdividing analyses by intervention class; dose of intervention used when available; and study durations.

The cumulative incidence of endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers with placebo were 15% and 6% respectively. Misoprostol significantly reduced the relative risk of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcers by 74% (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.39, random effects; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), and 58% (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.81, random effects; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). These relative risks correspond to a 12.0%, and 3% absolute risk reductions for gastric and duodenal ulcers respectively.

<P>All the studied doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers, and a dose response relationship was demonstrated for endoscopic gastric ulcers. Six studies with 2,461 participants used misoprostol 400 &#956;g (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agrawal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Agrawal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verdickt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Verdickt 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1988</LINK>), one study with 928 participants used 600 &#956;g daily (<LINK REF="STD-Raskin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 1995</LINK>), and seven with 2,423 participants used 800 &#956;g daily (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliot-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elliot 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agrawal-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Agrawal 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 1988</LINK>). Misoprostol 800 &#956;g daily was associated with the lowest risk (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>) of endoscopic gastric ulcers when compared to placebo, whereas misoprostol 400 &#956;g daily was associated with a relative risk of (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.67, random effects model for heterogeneity; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). The observed heterogeneity in the 400 &#956;g dose group was the result of the addition of the Chan study (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2001a</LINK>). This study compared the relatively more toxic naproxen with low dose misoprostol to nabumatone alone. In this study the risk of ulcers was inexplicably greater in the misoprostol group, but we feel this result is based on the differences between the safety of the comparator NSAIDS rather than the prophylactic agent. As a sensitivity analysis, removal of the <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2001a</LINK> study eliminates the observed heterogeneity without significantly altering the results, giving low dose misoprostol prophylaxis a RR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.51; <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). This difference between high and low dose misoprostol reached statistical significance (P=0.0055). The intermediate misoprostol dose (600 &#956;g daily) was not statistically different from either the low or high dose. The pooled relative risk reduction of 78% (4.7% absolute risk difference, (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49; <LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>) for duodenal ulcers with misoprostol 800 &#956;g daily was not statistically different from those of the lower daily misoprostol dosages.</P>

<P>Only one RCT, the MUCOSA trial, evaluated the efficacy of misoprostol prophylaxis against clinically important NSAID induced ulcer complications. In this study, of 8,843 participants studied over six months, the overall GI event incidence was about 1.5% per year (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>). Misoprostol 800 &#956;g/day was associated with a statistically significant 40% risk reduction (OR 0.598; 95% CI 0.364 to 0.982) in combined GI events (P=0.049), representing a risk difference of 0.38% (from 0.95% to 0.57%). Overall, approximately 260 participants would have to be treated with misoprostol to prevent one clinically important GI event. This NNT would drop as higher risk participants are considered. Misoprostol appeared to be ineffective at preventing endoscopically proven GI haemorrhage alone.

Several studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of clinically important ulcer complications (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2007</LINK>), therefore suggesting that a strategy of a tNSAID with a PPI also reduces the risk of clinical ulcer complications.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-04-12 11:48:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that misoprostol, PPIs, and double doses of H2RAs are effective at reducing the risk of both endoscopic gastric and duodenal NSAID induced ulcers. Standard doses of H2RAs are not effective at reducing the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers. Misoprostol is the only prophylactic agent to date that has been evaluated in a true clinical outcome trial, and has been shown to reduce the risk of NSAID related ulcer complications. However, its use is associated with significant adverse effects particularly at higher doses.</P>
<P>It is difficult to comment on the relative efficacy of the different prophylactic agents since the studies involving head to head comparisons often used doses of the comparator drug that are known to be less effective. For example, misoprostol and omeprazole were compared to standard dose ranitidine, and omeprazole was compared to misoprostol 400 &#956;g/day in one study. However, with these limitations in mind, misoprostol was found to be superior to standard dose H2RAs at reducing endoscopic gastric ulcers. Omeprazole was superior to standard dose ranitidine at reducing the risk of both endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers. However, omeprazole was superior to misoprostol at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal but not gastric ulcers. In fact based on a single study misoprostol appeared superior to lansoprazole for the secondary prevention of NSAID induced gastric ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2002</LINK>). The true clinical implications of this last point is not clear and may be small, but requires further research.</P>
<P>Overall we found that H2RAs and PPIs were better tolerated than misoprostol, and reduced NSAID related dyspeptic symptoms. Unfortunately, the reporting of symptoms and drug induced side effects were variable in these studies, a problem seen in a variety of other clinical trials. For the current review we concentrated on the reporting of side-effects causing drop-out from the studies. We felt that this end-point would be more reliably reported than side-effects alone. The definitions of dyspepsia, and abdominal pain were also variable or not given in these trials, so we combined these as a composite endpoint. The reporting of diarrhoea was more uniform, likely because it is a common side effect of misoprostol, and this end-point was used as a symptom not causing drop-out. Great care was taken in the abstraction and interpretation of the side-effect data, but the variable reporting of these endpoints may be a potential source of bias.</P>
<P>Because misoprostol is associated with more frequent adverse symptoms than the other agents, we also looked at the effect of dose on the efficacy and tolerability of this agent. Misoprostol 800 &#956;g/day is more effective at reducing gastric ulcers than 400 &#956;g/day. However, both 400 &#956;g and 800 &#956;g daily are associated with significantly more diarrhoea than placebo, and the effectiveness of low doses of misoprostol in the reduction of clinical ulcer complications is not well studied. Therefore, the practice of using lower doses of misoprostol to avoid its associated adverse effects should be questioned.</P>
<P>High risk GI patients represent another area of clinical importance. Several strategies have been evaluated in high risk patients with previous GI bleeding (see GI safety of COX-2 review). The studies focused on comparisons of COX-2 inhibitors (COX-2s) alone and in combination with a PPI, and showed that a strategy of a COX-2 alone was similar to a strategy of using a traditional NSAID with a PPI. However, the rate of re-bleeding with both strategies was still relatively high suggesting that neither strategy was completely effective. However, strategy of a COX-2 + PPI was associated with the greatest protection from recurrent re-bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>A lot has changed in the NSAID field since the last update of this review. In the early 2000s, it appeared that COX-2s were going to completely replace traditional non selective NSAIDs. In fact, prescriptions, and sales of traditional NSAIDs dropped while COX-2 prescriptions rose to level that suggested that physicians were prescribing COX-2s to patients that were not previously treated with NSAIDs. However, by 2004, greater information regarding the cardiovascular (CVS) safety of COX-2s started to emerge. A large systematic review demonstrated that COX-2 were associated with increased risk of CVS events (<LINK REF="REF-Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 2006</LINK>). In addition, one COX-2 was found to be associated with a serious dermatologic disorder while another was associated with higher than expected rates of hepatotoxicity. These factors ultimately led to the withdrawal of most of these agents from the market place. In North America, only celecoxib remains. These events, resulted in a precipitous fall in COX-2 prescriptions, with a resurgence in traditional NSAID use along with a gastro-protective agent such as a PPI. However, traditional NSAIDs were not left unscathed. Several lines of data also suggested that non-naproxen NSAIDs were associated with similar CVS toxicity as the COX-2s, further casting confusion amongst clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009</LINK>). Recently several consensus guidelines have been published to help guide clinicians in their management of patients with arthritic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ideal means of reducing the risk of upper GI toxicity among chronic NSAIDs users is complex. Several factors influence the risk of NSAID related upper GI toxicity: increasing age (&gt;65), previous peptic ulcer disease, co-morbid medical illnesses, the type of NSAID, the use of multiple NSAIDS and the combined use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gabriel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabriel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hallas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laporte-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laporte 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hochain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochain 1995</LINK>). Therefore, younger patients without co-morbidities or previous GI NSAID complications can be treated with a traditional NSAID alone (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maetzel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maetzel 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For patients with low gastrointestinal risk and high cardiovascular risk, naproxen may be preferred because of the potentially lower cardiovascular risk than with other tNSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors. However, since these patients are assumed to be on low-dose ASA therapy, the combination of naproxen plus ASA would increase the gastrointestinal risk, and therefore, the addition of a gastro-protective agent such as a PPI should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009</LINK>). For patients at very high risk of upper gastrointestinal events, a combination of a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI may offer the best gastrointestinal safety profile. When both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks are high, the optimal strategy is to avoid NSAID therapy if at all possible. If the NSAID therapy is deemed necessary, then the clinician must prioritise the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks, recognizing that these patients are likely taking ASA for their cardiovascular risk and choose a strategy that addresses the clinical profile recognizing, that there would likely be incomplete protection either on the CVS or GI side with a choice of COX-2 + PPI or naproxen + PPI respectively.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-08 21:15:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Misoprostol at 800 &#956;g daily reduces the occurrence of NSAID related clinical ulcer complications. Lower doses of misoprostol are associated with fewer side effects of diarrhoea but are less effective at preventing endoscopic gastric ulcers. The effects of low doses of misoprostol on ulcer complications are unknown, so the use of lower doses may be associated with a significant clinical tradeoff. Standard doses of H2RAs should not be used for prophylaxis against NSAID toxicity. Double doses of H2RAs and standard doses of PPIs are effective at preventing endoscopic duodenal and gastric ulcers, reduce NSAID related dyspepsia and are better tolerated than misoprostol. In high risk GI patients, a COX-2 alone or a traditional NSAID + a PPI offer similar but potentially insufficient protection from recurrent bleeding and a COX-2 + PPI can be considered.</P>

<P>This systematic review includes all the published data that we could identify for the long term prevention (four weeks or greater) of tNSAID related gastroduodenal injury. This field rapidly evolved with the introduction of COX-2 inhibitors, but with the recognition of the toxicity of those agents, clinicians are moving back toward using tNSIADs with gastro-protection. While there is a single large outcome study for the prevention of clinical ulcer events such as bleeding with misoprostol, and multiple such studies for the COX-2 inhibitors, there is less direct evidence for the PPIs. However, there is data that suggests in high risk GI patients who require NSAIDs, a COX-2 alone and a tNSAID with a PPI offer similar protection from recurrent bleeding. No such data exists for H2RAs, and it is unlikely that a large outcome study with PPIs or H2RAs would now be conducted in average risk arthritic patients requiring long term tNSAID use.</P>

<LI>Further study is required to better characterize the relative CVS effects of the various traditional NSAIDs and to determine if naproxen in anti-inflammatory doses also requires the addition of low dose ASA for cardioprotection in those with CVS disease. In patients with CVS disease who require ASA, is the use of low dose COX-2+ASA safer than the naproxen + ASA when either is used with a PPI?</LI>
<LI>The comparative cost effectiveness of various strategies for the treatment of arthritic patients including standard NSAIDs with or without prophylaxis with the various agents discussed in this review, compared with treatment with COX-2 inhibitors alone and with the inevitable co-prescribing of COX-2 agents and PPIs would greatly assist clinicians and policy makers alike in rationalizing this rapidly changing field.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Original feedback</HEADING>
<P>We were pleased to read the review article as it addresses an important clinical question (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>). We did however identify some important issues that hinder our ability to apply the results in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Firstly, in the background, the authors noted that endoscopic ulcers can be found in approximately 40% of chronic NSAID users and up to 85% of documented endoscopic ulcers do not become clinically apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>). However, in the results, we have concerns about the lack of discussion regarding the use of surrogate endpoints, such as endoscopic ulcers, to predict meaningful endpoints such as clinical ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>). Evidence showing a direct relationship in the same trial between endoscopic gastroduodenal ulcers and clinically significant ulcer complications is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>). We would recommend including a discussion on the uncertain clinical relevance of endoscopic ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondly, the overwhelming majority of trials included in the review (38/41) reported only on endoscopic ulcers; leaving a very small sample of only three trials that reported on clinical ulcers and the subsequent complications. It is believed that selective outcome reporting bias can have significant implications on the assessment of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-McGauran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGauran 2010</LINK>).<SUP> </SUP>One way to address the issue of selective outcome reporting bias is through contacting the authors of the individual trials and requesting to see their clinical outcome data.  In this review article, there was no indication of an attempt to contact the authors of the individual trials for information on potential clinical events (i.e. symptomatic ulcers, bleeding, etc). The authors of the review discussed that the MUCOSA trial was the only true clinical outcome trial; however, no attempt was made to highlight the potential dangers of drawing conclusions from a single study without replication. In fact, the authors went on to summarize that &#8220;misoprostol at 800 ug daily reduces the occurrence of NSAID related clinical ulcer complications&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>). We do not feel that this statement is justified.</P>
<P>Ninety three percent of trials did not report on clinical ulcers and this should have been emphasized in the review. Our interpretation of the available literature is that there is insufficient evidence to determine if gastroprotection with any class of drugs reduces the incidence of clinical complications that are important to patients on long-term NSAID therapy.</P>
<P>Lastly, we would like to note a potential transcription error on page 40 (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>).<SUP> </SUP> In the list of characteristics of included studies, the sample size described in the <LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK> trial appears to be missing the last numerical digit in the sample size at entry and should read 4404 and 4439 instead of 440 and 443. As a reader, it&#8217;s helpful to understand all abbreviations used. In addition, the authors did not define the abbreviations POB and PUB used in reference to proton pump inhibitor clinical endpoint trials.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-04-15 14:03:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank you for your letter and comments.</P>
<P>Your major concerns revolve around the usage of the endoscopic endpoint in the majority of the trials included in this review, and you are also uncomfortable with the results of the mucosa study as it is a single clinical ulcer study.</P>
<P>Both these points were emphasised in our review including in the methods and discussion.</P>
<P>The feedback authors should be aware that the design and execution of a randomized controlled trial utilizing the endoscopic endpoint is very different than for a trial utilizing the clinical ulcer composite endpoints (which typically include bleeding, perforation, or obstruction). The common nature of endoscopic endpoints means that NSAID studies utilizing them can be small (few hundred patients), short (4 to 12 weeks), and relatively inexpensive despite all patients undergoing endoscopy.  These studies can be high quality and powered to detect significant changes in this endpoint. For example, proton pump inhibitors reduce the relative risk of endoscopically detected duodenal ulcers by greater than 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>).  So it is no wonder that the vast majority of researchers conducting NSAID studies, particularly the early traditional NSAID (tNSAID) trials and cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (COX-2s) trials, utilized this endpoint.</P>
<P>NSAID trials that utilize clinical ulcer endpoints need to be very large (thousands of patients), quite long (6 months at least), and need formal adjudication of potential endpoint events as not every patient undergoes endoscopy. The complexity and expense of these studies limited their early usage until the COX-2 era arrived. Therefore, we feel the MUCOSA study (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>) can be considered landmark in that it was the first to exercise this more complex design and subsequently was used as a model for the clinical ulcer trials conducted for the COX-2s. Furthermore, the MUCOSA trial (<LINK REF="STD-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Silverstein 1995</LINK>) identified that clinical events occur at a rate of about 1.5% per 100 patient years amongst tNSAID users, a finding that was repeatedly identified in the COX-2 clinical ulcer studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>). MUCOSA was a high quality study and we have no reservation in the rating we gave it and as such in the believability of its results (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no question that the clinical ulcer studies are the preferred source of evidence over endoscopic studies particularly for the evaluation of the safety of new agents as suggested by the FDA (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>). However at the same November 4th, 2010 FDA meeting, the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee agreed that endoscopic ulcers are &#8220;an adequate primary efficacy endpoint for evaluating products intended to prevent NSAID-associated upper GI toxicity&#8221;. Therefore, it would be unwise to discount all the available data from endoscopic studies. These studies demonstrated remarkable consistency in placebo arms event rates across the tNSAID and COX-2 studies. Furthermore while there is not a one to one relationship between endoscopic ulcers and clinical ulcers, clearly there is a relationship and few experts in the field would discount that today. In our own work, we have found that misoprostol and COX-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of clinical ulcers by about 50%, while the same agents reduce the risk of endoscopic ulcers by close to 80% depending on whether one is speaking of endoscopic gastric or duodenal ulcers. Ironically, in previous versions of the review and in our book chapters we discussed at length the relationship between endoscopic ulcers and clinical ulcers, but this was removed recently as a relationship has become more accepted. So we feel that reporting on the endoscopic studies is valuable and appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2009c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rostom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostom 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>You also mention that one could contact authors for inclusion of unreported clinical events occurring within the endoscopic studies to avoid bias. However, we purposely did not include this type of data even when a clinical event was occasionally mentioned in a paper. The reason for this as detailed above is simply that these studies were not designed to look for these events in a systematic way, nor were adjudication of such events described a priori and consistently among the endoscopic ulcer studies. We strongly feel that inclusion of such reports would introduce multiple other sources of bias and would not improve our understanding in a tangible fashion. The Hong Kong studies included in our review are of course different in that they were designed to report on both types of endpoints by utilizing a very high risk NSAID population where clinical endpoints occur at a relatively high rate to allow for a relatively short, and small study (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lastly thank you for identifying the typos related to the MUCOSA study table.</P>
<P>In summary, we respect your opinion that &#8220;that there is insufficient evidence to determine if gastroprotection with any class of drugs reduces the incidence of clinical complications that are important to patients on long-term NSAID therapy&#8221;, but we respectfully disagree.</P>
