<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:24:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>The liver has various functions, including the production and storage of substances necessary for the sustenance of life. It processes toxic substances (including those that are produced within the body because of the breakdown of old red cells) and plays a role in the excretion of these processed toxic substances. It produces bile, which contains substances necessary for the digestion of food. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder and reaches the small bowel via the bile duct, usually in response to a stimulus such as ingestion of fatty food. The processed toxic substances are transported in the bile. These processed toxic substances are eventually excreted when the person opens his or her bowel. When there is obstruction to the flow of bile, the breakdown products of red cells can accumulate and cause yellowish discolouration of the skin and other linings in the body such as the white of the eyeball and the undersurface of the tongue. This results in a form of jaundice called obstructive jaundice. The obstruction to the bile flow is usually caused by stones in the common bile duct. These stones can originate from the gallbladder or from common bile duct stones. The majority of such stones can be treated endoscopically. However, a small proportion of the stones require surgery for removal. Other major causes of biliary obstruction include narrowing of the bile duct resulting from inflammation caused by stones, injury to the bile duct during operations to remove the gallbladder, and cancer of the bile duct, pancreas (an organ situated behind and below the stomach that secretes the digestive juices necessary for the digestion of food in addition to containing the cells that secrete insulin in order to maintain blood sugar levels), or the upper part of the small bowel called the duodenum. Operative removal is currently the only curative treatment available for these cancers. Such operations are typically major operations. However, the presence of toxic substances because of obstruction to the bile flow can result in physiological disturbances. Some surgeons perform certain procedures to temporarily drain the bile before performing the major operation to remove biliary obstruction due to stones, inflammation, or cancer. These pre-operative procedures can be done endoscopically (by introducing an instrument equipped with a camera through the mouth and into the small intestine and then inserting a small drainage tube through that instrument and past the obstruction in the bile duct) or under X-ray or other forms of image guidance via the liver. However, other surgeons argue that the temporary procedures to drain the bile are not necessary and that one should perform surgery directly. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only regarding this controversy. Such studies, when conducted properly, provide the best evidence. Two authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials.</P>
<P>We included six trials involving 510 patients for this review. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 40 to 202. All trials had a high risk of bias, that is, the trials may overestimate benefits and underestimate harms. There was no significant difference in risk of death between the two groups. The rate of serious complications was higher in the patients who underwent biliary drainage prior to operation compared with those who underwent surgery directly. The quality of life was not reported in any trial. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups. The costs were not reported in any of the trials. Based on the currently available best evidence, there is no justification for the use of routine drainage of bile before a major operation in patients with obstruction to the flow of bile. Routine biliary drainage should not be funded and may result in litigations. Furthermore, well designed trials with low risk of systematic errors and low risk of random errors (low risk of play of chance) may be necessary.</P>

<P>Patients with obstructive jaundice have various pathophysiological changes that affect the liver, kidney, heart, and the immune system. There is considerable controversy as to whether temporary relief of biliary obstruction prior to major definitive surgery (pre-operative biliary drainage) is of any benefit to the patient.</P>

<P>To assess the benefits and harms of pre-operative biliary drainage versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (direct surgery) in patients with obstructive jaundice (irrespective of a benign or malignant cause).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-07 14:57:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded<I> </I>until February 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:24:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials comparing biliary drainage followed by surgery versus direct surgery, performed for obstructive jaundice, irrespective of the sample size, language, and publication status.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:16:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), rate ratio (RaR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the available patient analyses. We assessed the risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefit or systematic underestimation of harm) with components of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed the risk of play of chance (random errors) with trial sequential analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:16:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We included six trials with 520<B> </B>patients comparing pre-operative biliary drainage (265 patients) versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (255 patients). Four trials used percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and two trials used endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting as the method of pre-operative biliary drainage. The risk of bias was high in all trials. The proportion of patients with malignant obstruction varied between 60% and 100%. There was no significant difference in mortality (40/265, weighted proportion 14.9%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (34/255, 13.3%) (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.71; P = 0.60). The overall serious morbidity was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (60 per 100 patients in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus 26 per 100 patients in the direct surgery group) (RaR 1.66; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.16; P = 0.0002). The proportion of patients who developed serious morbidity was significantly higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (75/102, 73.5%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (37/94, 37.4%) (P &lt; 0.001). Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay (2 trials, 271 patients; MD 4.87 days; 95% CI -1.28 to 11.02; P = 0.12) between the two groups. Trial sequential analysis showed that for mortality only a small proportion of the required information size had been obtained. There seemed to be no significant differences in the subgroup of trials assessing percutaneous compared to endoscopic drainage.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:24:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>There is currently not sufficient evidence to support or refute routine pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. Pre-operative biliary drainage may increase the rate of serious adverse events. So, the safety of routine pre-operative biliary drainage has not been established. Pre-operative biliary drainage should not be used in patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice outside randomised clinical trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Obstructive jaundice is the term used for the increased serum bilirubin levels as result of obstruction to the flow of bile due to blockage in the large bile ducts. The clinical symptoms and signs of obstructive jaundice include yellow discolouration of skin and conjunctiva, dark urine, pale stools, and pruritus. The main causes of obstructive jaundice include benign common bile duct stones or benign biliary stricture (secondary to common bile duct stones or a complication of cholecystectomy) and malignancy due to periampullary cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Bjornsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjornsson 2008</LINK>). Periampullary cancer is the term used for cancers that form near the ampulla of Vater (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2012</LINK>) and includes cancer of the head and neck of the pancreas, cancer of the distal end of the bile duct, cancer of the ampulla of Vater, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. Surgical resection is generally considered the only curative treatment for malignant obstructive jaundice. Approximately 20% of periampullary cancers presenting to surgeons are resectable (<LINK REF="REF-Michelassi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelassi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engelken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelken 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Obstructive jaundice affects various organs and physiologic mechanisms in the body and can result in kidney failure (<LINK REF="REF-Wadei-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadei 2006</LINK>), cardiac dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Wadei-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadei 2006</LINK>), liver injury (<LINK REF="REF-Pauli_x002d_Magnus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauli-Magnus 2005</LINK>), haemostatic abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Papadopoulos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papadopoulos 2007</LINK>), and altered body immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Nehez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nehez 2002</LINK>). Restoration of biliary flow prior to operation (pre-operative biliary drainage) can be performed by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage under radiologic guidance or endoscopic sphincterotomy and placement of a stent across the obstruction of the biliary tract (<LINK REF="REF-Pisters-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pisters 2001</LINK>). Patients presenting with cholangitis may require pre-operative biliary drainage to allow their condition to improve sufficiently to allow surgery. However, many physicians routinely perform pre-operative drainage in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 2003</LINK>) with the intention of relieving the biliary obstruction and reversing the pathophysiological changes caused by obstructive jaundice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>Pre-operative drainage relieves the obstruction and may reverse the pathophysiological dysfunction caused by obstructive jaundice. As a result, the patient-relevant outcomes may improve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why this review is important</HEADING>
<P>A previous meta-analysis showed that pre-operative biliary drainage in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice carries no benefit and should not be performed routinely (<LINK REF="REF-Sewnath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sewnath 2002</LINK>). In our previous Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2008</LINK>), we concluded that there is no evidence to support or refute pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. However, the trials included in these two reviews were old and the applicability of the two reviews in modern surgical practice can be questioned. In this updated version, which includes a new trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Gaag-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van der Gaag 2010</LINK>), we have revised the methods in line with the revision of the methods in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and reanalysed and revised our interpretation of the data.</P>

<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also planned to report the risk difference if it was different from the RR since risk difference includes trials with zero events in both groups and allows meta-analysis. For continuous variables, we planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for hospital stay; and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for variables such as quality of life. For serious adverse events, we calculated the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI. For time-to-event variables, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI.</P>

We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding the trials in which medians or standard deviations were imputed for the continuous outcomes. Both these sensitivity analyses were planned.

We also performed another post hoc sensitivity analysis including all bile leaks irrespective of the way they were treated, except those leaks which clearly resolved spontaneously. Bile leaks are post-operative complications. Some resolve spontaneously without any prolongation of hospital stay and hence will be assessed as mild adverse events. Other bile leaks need radiological or endoscopic interventions and hence will be classified as serious adverse events. If the trial authors did not report the way the bile leaks were treated then it is not possible to determine their severity. So, we performed two analyses, one excluding the bile leaks which resolved spontaneously and those for which the treatment was not reported, and another including the bile leaks for which the treatment was not reported but excluding the bile leaks which clearly resolved spontaneously.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:22:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Our review showed that combining pre-operative biliary drainage with surgery compared with direct surgery increased the proportion of serious adverse events without any apparent significant advantages. The overall mortality in patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing surgery was approximately 15.1% in the pre-operative biliary drainage group and 13.3% in the control group (no statistically significant difference). One of the factors in this finding that we explored was whether this represents the current situation since many of the trials were old. So, we calculated the mortality excluding the trial by van der Gaag et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Gaag-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van der Gaag 2010</LINK>), which recruited patients between November 2003 and June 2008 and contributed nearly 40% of the patients in the review. In this trial, the mortality of patients in the pre-operative biliary drainage group was 14.7% compared with 12.8% in the no pre-operative biliary drainage group (no statistically significant difference). The overall mortality in the other trials (that is, excluding the trial by van der Gaag et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Gaag-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van der Gaag 2010</LINK>)) was similar (15.3% in the pre-operative biliary drainage group and 13.7% in the no pre-operative biliary drainage group) demonstrating no significant reduction in the mortality associated with major surgeries in patients with obstructive jaundice over time. This is in contrast to the generally quoted mortality of 2% to 4% for pancreaticoduodenectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diener-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diener 2011</LINK>) and may reflect the severity of the jaundice or the severity of cancer in the patients included in the trials.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the two intervention groups with regards to mortality in the present review. The main question is whether this is a lack of effect or lack of evidence of an effect. We used trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>) with an alpha error of 0.05, beta error of 0.20, control event proportion of 13%, and a relative risk reduction of 20% to identify whether the region of futility was reached. This analysis revealed that the region of futility was not yet reached, and so we cannot rule out any difference in the mortality between pre-operative biliary drainage and direct surgery. In addition, we utilised the definition of imprecision of results used by the GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>)(which is currently recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration for grading the level of evidence, <A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/other-resources/gradepro">http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/other-resources/gradepro</A>). The total number of events in this review was less than 400 and the CI for mortality (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.71) overlaps no effect (that is, RR of 1) and appreciable benefit or harm (25% increase, that is, RR of 1.25; and 25% reduction, that is, RR of 0.75). This supports the results of the trial sequential analysis that one cannot rule out a difference in the mortality between pre-operative biliary drainage and direct surgery. The long-term survival was reported in only one of the trials. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Again, the CI was wide for this outcome. So, we are unable to rule out any difference in the long-term survival between pre-operative biliary drainage and direct surgery.</P>
<P>The overall severe morbidity was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group than the direct surgery group. This difference is consistent with different statistical methods used and various sensitivity analyses. There was heterogeneity in the outcome, mainly because of the magnitude of the effect rather than the direction of the effect; that is, the number of serious adverse event was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was also higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group than the direct surgery group, although this information is only from one recent trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Gaag-2010" TYPE="STUDY">van der Gaag 2010</LINK>). The definitions used for serious adverse events were those used by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and are used by regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), MDA, and Japan Society of Quality Assurance (JSQA) in US, Europe, and Japan, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) in determining the adverse events related to a pharmacological intervention. While it is not mandatory to report radiological, endoscopic, and surgical interventions using these definitions, we have used these definitions in the absence of any other universal definitions for complications. Serious adverse events of the ICH-GCP classification roughly correspond to class III or class IV in the Clavien-Dindo classification (<LINK REF="REF-Dindo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dindo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clavien-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clavien 2009</LINK>), the only validated classification system in assessing surgical interventions. Inevitably, some information will be lost by using such classifications which pool complications together. However, unless such an approach is followed, it is difficult to power trials related to surgery using any meaningful outcomes to the patients. We acknowledge that some complications are temporarily worse than others in terms of treatment required to resolve complications, prolongation of hospital stay, and the cost implications. However, the use of generic definitions for complications enables comparison of treatment across different disciplines of medicine. Until further validated definitions of serious adverse events become available, it is reasonable to use the definitions that are currently used by regulatory authorities in US, Europe, and Japan to assess pharmacological interventions on non-pharmacological interventions.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported quality of life. Adequate decompression of the biliary obstruction may improve the quality of life by reducing the symptoms of biliary obstruction such as itching. On the other hand, it may produce anxiety by delaying surgery while waiting for resolution of jaundice and because of the complications related to the pre-operative biliary drainage procedure. From a patient's perspective, long-term survival and quality of life (which takes any permanent disability or morbidity into account) are the important determinants that should guide the healthcare provider about the use of the procedure. However, in the absence of differences in such long-term outcomes, short-term outcomes such as morbidity and hospital stay may be quite important. From a health funder perspective, cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), which takes into account long-term survival and quality of life along with short-term outcomes such as morbidity (and the cost for management of the morbidity) and hospital stay, are important determinants to fund or not to fund the treatment. Hospital stay in the pre-operative biliary drainage group will include the hospital stay to perform the drainage, repeat the procedure if the drainage is not adequate, and treat any complications resulting from pre-operative biliary drainage along with the post-operative hospital stay. Considering that the morbidity is higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group without any beneficial effects funding for pre-operative biliary drainage seems inappropriate.</P>
<P>One of the important questions that needs to be answered was whether pre-operative biliary drainage was performed appropriately. Pre-operative biliary drainage is aimed at restoring the flow of bile in patients with obstructive jaundice, thereby reversing the pathophysiological changes due to obstructive jaundice. The criteria used to assess success of pre-operative biliary drainage and the duration of pre-operative biliary drainage varied between the trials. A short drainage time may not be enough to demonstrate benefit, but a long drainage time may increase the risk of pre-operative biliary drainage-related complications and allow cancer progression. There is very little information available about the duration of the drainage period required to reverse the pathophysiological changes associated with obstructive jaundice, and so the optimal duration of drainage is not clear. There is also considerable controversy about the method of drainage and the type of stent used (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kloek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kloek 2010</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:22:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>This evidence is applicable to patients with obstructive jaundice who are fit for direct surgery, that is, do not have sepsis that precludes a major operation and those who undergo neoadjuvant therapy where an alternative treatment such as chemotherapy is carried out before definitive surgery is performed (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2006</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:22:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>As regards the quality of evidence, we assessed this under the headings described by the GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and the strength of the recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>). This included the risk of bias in the trials and consistency and directness of evidence apart from the precision of the results, which was discussed earlier. As regards the risk of bias, all the trials were at a high risk of bias. Allocation was unclear in most of the trials. Blinding of outcome assessors was not performed in most of the trials. Most of the trials had post-randomisation drop-outs (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). From the information available from the trials regarding post-randomisation drop-outs, there is no specific mechanism of drop-out. Considering that the intervention was started pre-operatively and that no surgery was carried out in patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria or refused the surgery, it appears that post-randomisation drop-outs are inevitable. While an available patient analysis may be appropriate when the drop-outs are not related to the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>), strict intention-to-treat analysis has to be followed in this situation since some patients could become unresectable during pre-operative biliary drainage (while waiting for definitive surgery). Overall, the risk of bias is high and the true effect may be different from the effect obtained in this meta-analysis. As regards consistency, as discussed previously the effect of pre-operative biliary drainage on mortality appears to be consistent, while the magnitude of the effect on serious adverse events is not consistent across trials. As far as directness of evidence is concerned, there is not much concern about the directness of short-term mortality and morbidity. However, there is little information available related to quality of life and to long-term morbidity and mortality. However, in spite of all these deficiencies in the quality of evidence, this review seems to be the best evidence available on this topic.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:22:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>We followed the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). There were no language, publication status, or sample size restrictions. Thus, we minimised the bias due to the selection of only randomised clinical trials. We were unable to assess reporting bias because of the few trials identified. The intervention has been available for several years now, including the pre-mandatory trial registration era, so we cannot be sure whether there are any unreported or unidentified trials. However, one has to be pragmatic and accept that the results of such trials are unlikely to be available in the near future and we have assessed the information that is available.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-14 11:23:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Based on the above discussions, it appears that there is no strong evidence to recommend or refute pre-operative biliary drainage. So, should we allow individual clinicians to treat patients according to their preference? The answer is 'no', as this can result in fragmentation of care and can lead to suboptimal performance (<LINK REF="REF-Swensen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swensen 2010</LINK>). It is necessary to standardise treatments and develop guidelines in order to improve health care (<LINK REF="REF-Swensen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swensen 2010</LINK>). Adoption of routine pre-operative biliary drainage into clinical practice was not evidence-based. In spite of randomised trials repeatedly showing lack of evidence of any benefit of pre-operative biliary drainage, clinicians continue to use routine pre-operative biliary drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 2003</LINK>). One can argue that our recommendation is based on randomised trials at high risk of bias. However, the argument for the routine use of pre-operative biliary drainage is based on even more flawed study designs. Furthermore, randomised trials with high risk of bias usually overestimate intervention benefits and underestimate the intervention harms of the experimental intervention, that is, pre-operative biliary drainage. As we have identified risks of significant harms in the included trials, our results suggest that the reality may be worse. One should not justify current mistakes based on past errors. Instead, it is reasonable to acknowledge past mistakes and avoid such mistakes in the future. We acknowledge that new randomised clinical trials may show results which are different from the conclusions of our systematic review. There are no new randomised clinical trials registered in the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, which includes the major clinical trials registers. So, the evidence reviewed in our review is the best evidence available currently, which is likely to remain so for the next few years. One cannot base current practice on future speculative results but it ought to be based on the currently available information. Until new evidence with low risk of bias emerges, the present systematic review is the best available evidence on this topic.</P>
<P>In conclusion, pre-operative biliary drainage does not appear to be beneficial to the patients or healthcare funders in any way. It may increase serious adverse events and could add to the cost of the health care. We do not recommend routine use of pre-operative biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice who are about to undergo surgery outside well-designed randomised clinical trials with low risk of systematic error and random error, and those trials that include long-term survival and quality of life as important outcomes. We recommend that routine pre-operative biliary drainage should not be funded. There may also be medico-legal implications of these findings, making physicians vulnerable to litigations in cases of complications related to routine pre-operative biliary drainage.</P>
<P>A previous meta-analysis showed that pre-operative biliary drainage with malignant obstructive jaundice carries no benefit and should not be performed routinely (<LINK REF="REF-Sewnath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sewnath 2002</LINK>). In our previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2008</LINK>), we concluded that there is no evidence to support or refute pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. In this review we go one important step further and state that pre-operative biliary drainage should not be used routinely outside well designed randomised clinical trials.</P>

<P>Well designed randomised clinical trials with low risk of systematic error and random error and those that include long-term survival and quality of life as important outcomes may be necessary. Such trials ought to stratify patients according to the likely cause of obstruction as well as to report both short- and long-term outcomes such as quality of life, non-serious adverse events, serious adverse events, and mortality. The trials should also describe the results of the pre-operative drainage and any delay to surgery this may have caused. Reporting of such trials according to the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/">http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/</A>) will enable transparent evaluation of the intervention.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of preoperative biliary drainage versus direct surgery for obstructive jaundice on mortality. The required information size of 11,130 patients was calculated based on a prevalence of death of 13% in the surgery group; a relative risk reduction of 20%; an alpha of 5%; and a beta of 20%. The cumulated Z-curve shows that only a small proportion, that is 520 patients, of the required number of patients to demonstrate differences in mortality has been recruited in all the clinical trials comparing pre-operative biliary drainage and direct surgery and that no statistical significant difference has been observed.</P>
