<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-14 15:09:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Premature birth is associated with various medical problems for the newborn including death and long-term health problems. The parents of premature babies can experience emotional turmoil and the economic costs are high for healthcare systems. Various medications have been used to delay the onset of labour and prevent premature deliveries but with limited success. Some of the drugs have side-effects. Progesterone is a hormone that is known to suppress uterine activity and keep the uterus quiescent until term. Medications that mimic this hormone (progestational agents) were first tried in the late 1950s but interest waned. Recently, new trials studying the use of progestational agents both for prevention as well as treatment of preterm labour have been published. This review of the literature found eight randomised controlled trials involving 563 women, but data from only seven studies from a total of 538 women with threatened or established preterm labour with intact membranes contributed data to this updated review. Four trials compared the use of progestational agents versus placebo in women concurrently treated with another drug to reduce uterine contractions (tocolytic agent). Progesterone was used independently in the other four trials compared with another tocolytic agent or placebo. Limited evidence suggests that the use of a progesterone, as a co-treatment, may reduce preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks' gestation and increase birthweight. There is insufficient evidence from the seven small studies with contributing data to advocate progestational agents as a tocolytic agent for women presenting with preterm labour.</P>

<P>Eight studies were included in this review, involving 563 women, but only seven studies, involving 538 women, contributed data for analyses. There are some data suggesting that the use of progestational agents results in a reduction of preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks of gestation and an increase in birthweight. The use of a progestational agent may also reduce the frequency of uterine contractions, prolong pregnancy and attenuate the shortening of cervical length. However, the analysis was limited by the relatively small number of available studies. The power of the meta-analysis was also limited by the varying types, dosages and routes of administration of progesterone.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-14 15:11:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm labour is one of the commonest complications of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Haram-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haram 2003</LINK>), and it results in preterm birth. According to the World Health Organization, delivery before completion of 37 weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1977</LINK>) is defined as preterm birth. Prematurity is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in many countries, accounting for at least one third of infant deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 2006</LINK>). This results in significant emotional distress for parents as well as economic costs (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2001</LINK>). Neonates born prematurely, especially those delivered before 32 weeks of gestation, are at risk of developing various complications including respiratory distress syndrome, necrotising enterocolitis and intraventricular haemorrhage. These complications often lead to prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and the need for different interventions. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to the perinatal morbidity and mortality related to preterm labour, preterm birth can lead to diminished long-term survival and reproduction in persons born preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Swamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swamy 2008</LINK>). The risks of medical and social disabilities in adulthood also increased with decreasing gestational age at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Moster-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moster 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various drugs and strategies have been used for the treatment of preterm labour. The pharmacologic agents currently used include betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, nitric oxide donors, magnesium, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and oxytocin receptor antagonists. Studies of these drugs have shown mixed results with little effect in improving pregnancy duration and insufficient data to confirm a definite beneficial effect on neonatal morbidity or mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Berkman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkman 2003</LINK>). Although betamimetics have been shown to be effective in delaying birth for 48 hours, which allows the administration of corticosteroids and in-utero transfer to tertiary centres, they are associated with significant side-effects that may be harmful to mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berkman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkman 2003</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers are therefore suggested to be the preferred agents, should tocolysis be indicated. However, the use of calcium channel agonists for treatment of preterm labour also does not lead to significant improvements in important neonatal outcomes such as admission to neonatal intensive care unit, low Apgar score and perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>). Oxytocin receptor antagonists seem particularly promising as an effective tocolytic agent with minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Lamont-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 2003</LINK>). However, a Cochrane review on the use of this tocolytic agent does not support the superiority of atosiban over betamimetics or placebo in terms of the tocolytic efficacy or neonatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>). In addition, its current cost is prohibitive. Insufficient data are available for the use of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>) or nitric oxide donors (<LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK>) for women in preterm labour. Magnesium sulphate is not recommended as a tocolytic agent as it is ineffective at delaying preterm birth and is associated with increased mortality for the child (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>). Thus, there is a need for further therapeutic options that are effective, affordable and safe.</P>
<P>Progesterone is known to have an inhibitory effect on uterine contractility (<LINK REF="REF-Lye-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lye 1978</LINK>) and is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of pregnancy until term (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karalis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karalis 1996</LINK>). In animal studies, progesterone decreases the concentration of oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Fuchs-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchs 1983</LINK>) and alpha-adrenergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1977</LINK>) in the myometrium, as well as local synthesis of prostaglandin F2 (<LINK REF="REF-Thoburn-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoburn 1979</LINK>). Progesterone is also able to modify the ultrastructural organisation of the myometrium by inhibiting the appearance of gap junctions, and preventing co-ordinated muscular contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Garfield-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garfield 1982</LINK>). Different routes of administration of progesterone have been described in the literature. These include weekly intramuscular injections from 16 to 20 weeks through to 36 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Meis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 2003</LINK>) and daily vaginal progesterone suppositories from 24 weeks to 34 weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-da-Fonseca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Fonseca 2003</LINK>).The safety of progesterone therapy in pregnancy is also well established (<LINK REF="REF-Check-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Check 1986</LINK>). Several small studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hartikainen_x002d_Sorri-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartikainen-Sorri 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauth-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauth 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LeVine-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeVine 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papiernik-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papiernik 1970</LINK>) have been conducted to test the effect of progestational agents for the prevention of preterm labour, but a systematic review at the end of the 1980s concluded that progestational agents were not effective for that purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1989</LINK>). However, another meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1990</LINK>) analysing trials using 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate only found a significant reduction in low birthweight babies in the treated group. Interest in the use of progestational agents for the prevention of preterm birth in high-risk women has also recently been revived with the publication of two randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-da-Fonseca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Fonseca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 2003</LINK>) showing a reduction in the rate of preterm delivery in treated women. Recent systematic reviews of the literature have shown that progesterone, when used for prevention of preterm labour, is effective to reduce the incidence of preterm birth and low birthweight newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farine 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 2005</LINK>) and that women at high risk of preterm birth should be recommended progestational agent therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Coomarasamy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coomarasamy 2006</LINK>). A recently published Cochrane review further confirmed the beneficial effects of progesterone in infant health following administration in women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth due either to past history of preterm birth or when a short cervix was identified on ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Besides focusing on the use of progestational agents to pre-empt the onset of preterm labour in high-risk women, some investigators have looked at the use of progestational agents for the treatment of threatened or established preterm labour. The first randomised controlled trial investigating the use of progesterone as a tocolytic agent dates back to 1960 (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK>). With the revived interest in progestational agents in relation to preterm birth in recent years, we systematically surveyed the literature for studies on this subject with a view to performing a meta-analysis in order to assess the efficacy of progestational agents in the treatment of threatened or established preterm labour.</P>

<P>Pregnant women diagnosed with established or threatened preterm labour before 37 completed weeks of gestation. Established labour is defined as the presence of regular uterine contractions and cervical dilatation of at least 3 cm. For threatened labour, uterine contractions are present but cervical dilatation is either absent or is less than 3 cm.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We excluded women with ruptured membranes and women with the possibility of placental abruptio. Women with ruptured membranes are at risk of chorioamnionitis, which is not a complication in women with preterm labour with intact membranes. The treatment including justification for tocolysis is different and hence the reason why we excluded this group of women. 쟙omen with the possibility of placental abruptio would likely require delivery instead of being treated with tocolysis. This group of women were therefore also excluded. Women with cervical incompetence were excluded due to the difference in the mechanism of the preterm labour.</P>

<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect the results.

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported)</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by 1 to 5 above)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-11-13 13:38:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1311130851004308223318473390273&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-RevMan-2012">RevMan 2012</A>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, provided that an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.</P>

<P>Out of these eight studies, the participants in four of them (<LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>) received another form of tocolytic agent prior to being randomised to either the treatment (progesterone) or placebo (or observation) group. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> received atosiban, whereas the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> received nifedipine. The participants in both <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK> received betamimetics (ritodrine). In <LINK REF="STD-Chawanpaiboon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawanpaiboon 2011</LINK>, the participants were randomised to either nifedipine, progesterone or bedrest. In <LINK REF="STD-Goel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Goel 2011</LINK>, the participants received either micronised progesterone or isoxupurine.

<P>Our primary outcome of preterm births at less than 37 weeks of gestation was reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> also analysed the percentage of preterm births at less than 35 weeks' gestation.

<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK> published a randomised double-blind controlled trial back in 1958, comparing the use of progesterone and placebo for women who presented with symptoms of threatened preterm labour. The study included women with rupture of membrane or vaginal bleeding being the initial symptoms, both of which were exclusion criteria in our review. Only data relating to the symptoms of rhythmic or constant pains were analysed. However, the gestational age of this group of participants was not clear, which made analyses difficult.</P>

Progesterone was used for maintaining the uterine quiescence rather than for treatment of the preterm labour in these studies. <LINK REF="STD-Szekeres_x002d_Bartho-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Szekeres-Bartho 1983</LINK> showed that preterm delivery occurred more frequently among women who did not receive any progesterone compared with those who received weekly progesterone after the initial resolution of preterm labour. <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2008</LINK> showed that women who did not receive progesterone after the initial resolution of preterm labour had significantly more cervical length shortening compared with women who received progesterone.</P>
<P>Another study compared the use of orciprenaline with a range of other tocolytic agents for the treatment of threatened premature labour (<LINK REF="STD-Bedoya-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bedoya 1972</LINK>). Progesterone was included in this range of tocolytic agents but there was no specific comparison between the use of orciprenaline with progesterone. This study was therefore excluded.<BR/>

<P>The randomisation process, in general, and the concealment of allocation, in particular, are considered the most important and sensitive indicators that bias has been minimised in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> were randomised. For <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>, the urn method of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 1988</LINK>) with stratification according to clinical centre, was used to create the computer-generated randomisation sequence. A 2:1 ratio was used for the assignment of women to 17 progesterone or to placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>, randomisation was carried out by a balanced series of six participants according to randomisation tables. In <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>, participants were randomised according to a computer-generated number list. In <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>, the randomisation sequence was generated using an electronic generator provided by random.org and a variable block size of eight or 12 was used.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK> was a quasi-randomised trial. In this study, participants with uneven admission numbers were treated with one preparation and those with even numbers received another preparation.

For <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>, the allocation list was managed by a senior midwife, whereas the interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> were distributed in a random order. For <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK>, allocation concealment was inadequate as allocation of treatment was based on odd or even numbers indicating that assignment of treatment could be predicted in advance. In <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>, treatment was allocated based on a computer-generated numbered list.

In addition, outcomes relating to infant morbidity (intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, use of mechanical ventilation and oxygen at seven and 28 days) were reported only for those 25 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); we assumed that all infants with these serious conditions would be likely to have been admitted to the NICU, but it is possible that infants lost to follow-up may also have had serious morbidity. For these outcomes we have used the number of infants in each group born in the study hospital as denominators.</P>

<P>The recent published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>) addressed our prespecified secondary outcomes related to perinatal morbidity. No statistically significant difference was demonstrated for the outcome of respiratory distress syndrome between the group where progesterone was used as an adjunct treatment to ritodrine and the group where placebo was used with ritodrine (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). The outcomes of neonatal intensive care admission (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), need for mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), oxygen requirement on day seven and day 28 of life were also studied (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). No statistically significant differences were demonstrated for these outcomes from analyses of these data. Peinatal mortality was studied in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>), which did not show any statistically significant difference (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK> showed a statistically significant increase in birthweight in the group co-treated with progesterone (mean difference (MD) 294 g, 95% CI 91.73 to 496.27; and MD 397.5 g, 95% CI 86.00 to 709.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This outcome measure was also studied by <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> and showed no difference between the placebo and intervention groups. However, as no standard deviations for birthweight were available in the publication by <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>, the outcome of birthweight could not be analysed using the forest plot and the data are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> also studied this outcome; it showed no statistically significant difference between the progesterone and placebo groups.

<P>The primary outcome of <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> was the number of deliveries within 48 hours of intervention, which is a prespecified secondary outcome in this review. The results did not show any statistically significant difference between the group where progesterone was used and the group where progesterone was not used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of progestational agents resulted in a statistically significant reduction in preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks of gestation (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98, I = 57%, Tau<SUP> </SUP>= 0.11; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

The study did not specifically compare the outcomes of the women with multiple pregnancies. All four women with multiple pregnancies (one in the ritodrine and placebo group and three in the ritodrine and progesterone group) had delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Due to the lack of data and the small number of participants with multiple pregnancies, subgroup analyses were not performed.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> also investigated the outcome of delivery before 35 weeks of gestation. Even though there is a trend showing that the addition of progesterone resulted in less deliveries before 35 weeks of gestation, the reduction was not statistically significant (average RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.50; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the primary outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK> was the time of intervention until delivery (latency period) and reported that micronised natural progesterone treatment resulted in a prolonged latency period of 32.1  17.8 days versus 21.2  16.3 days in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Chawanpaiboon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawanpaiboon 2011</LINK> analysed the success rate of inhibition of uterine contractions. Nifedipine, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (proluton depot) and bed rest were used to inhibit contractions with a success rate of 80%, 66% and 64% respectively, without statistical significance. However, when a time-to-event test was used, nifedipine took the shortest time for contraction inhibition in threatened preterm labour with statistical significance. Nifedipine took the shortest median time to inhibit contraction (3.00  0.48 hours with 95% CI of 4.18 to 5.83) while proluton took 5.00  0.42 hours with 95% CI of 2.07 to 3.93).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> showed that the group of participants who received progesterone had a reduction in both the dosage and the duration of the concomitant betamimetics administration. The length of hospitalisation was also significantly shorter in the group who received progesterone compared to the placebo group (13.6 days versus 17.8 days) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The results showed no statistically significant differences for outcomes including duration of pregnancy prolongation (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and frequency of uterine contraction (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). However, the results presented in the publication were not complete, with many outcomes being reported without standard deviations or standard errors. These included important outcome measures such as duration of pregnancy prolongation, birthweight and Apgar scores. Statistical analysis including the forest plots, therefore, could not be generated for these outcomes.</P>
<P>For the 53 participants with intact membranes in <LINK REF="STD-Erny-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Erny 1986</LINK>, 42.8% of the participants who received placebo showed decreasing frequency of uterine contractions in the placebo group and 88% of the participants who received utrogestan showed decreasing uterine contractions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK> reported that there were no differences between the progesterone group and placebo group with regards to the number of women for whom delivery was successfully postponed. The authors reported that a subanalysis of the women who presented with the initial symptoms of pains did not change the results. In this subgroup, three women in the placebo group delivered within 48 hours of treatment and two women in the intervention group delivered within 48 hours of treatment. The numbers were too small for statistical analysis.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-14 15:44:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first randomised controlled trial investigating progesterone as a tocolytic agent dates back to 1960. However, as other tocolytic agents evolved, the interests in pursuing progesterone for tocolysis waned. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the use of progestational agents, both as a prophylactic measure for preterm births as well as a treatment option for women in preterm labour.</P>
<P>For trials studying the efficacy of tocolytic agents, the most important clinical outcomes are the rates of preterm deliveries and the rates of low birthweight. Since the previous version of our review, data regarding the primary outcomes of very preterm birth of less than 34 weeks of gestation and birthweight of less than 2.5 kg have emerged. <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> was the first study to look at both these outcomes and it showed no difference between the progesterone and placebo groups. These should be universal outcome measures, which will allow meta-analyses to be performed, resulting in more meaningful conclusion.</P>
<P>There is now encouraging data to show that progesterone, when used with another tocolytic agent, results in a reduction of preterm births at less than 37 weeks of gestation. This outcome is studied by four trials thus far. Two studies showed an increase in birthweight in the group treated with progesterone. Rigorous and larger studies will be important to investigate these potential beneficial effects of progesterone for preterm labour.</P>
<P>The effects of the intervention on neonatal mortality and various aspects of neonatal morbidity are also crucial. These outcomes were not addressed in the previous version of our review but were addressed in two studies in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>). No statistically significant difference has been shown for the group randomised to progesterone compared with placebo. However, larger studies or combined data from various studies with similar outcome measures will be needed to achieve clinically meaningful and significant implications. Inclusion of these outcomes should be considered for any future trials investigating the effect of progesterone as a treatment option for threatened or established preterm labour.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> showed a statistically significant reduction in cervical length measurements in the group receiving progesterone compared with the group that did not receive progesterone at both seven (MD -1.54 mm; 95% CI -2.49 to -0.50) and 21 days (MD -2.20 mm; 95% CI -3.52 to -0.88) after randomisation. The difference between the two groups was even higher when the analysis was restricted only to women with a short cervix (less than or equal to 25 mm) at enrolment. This outcome has been reported in the two studies by the Facchinetti group so far (<LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2008</LINK>). With the advances of ultrasound technology, outcome measures such as cervical length measurements will play an increasingly important role. This would pose an interesting research area.</P>
<P>Two of the studies in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Erny-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Erny 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK>) included women with rupture of membranes on admission while another study included women with multiple pregnancies (<LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>). Rupture of membranes should be an exclusion criteria in studies investigating the effects of tocolytic agents for preterm labour. Management of women with preterm rupture of labour with added risks of chorioamnionitis is different from the treatment of women admitted for preterm labour with intact membranes. For <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>, one participant in the placebo arm and three participants in the progesterone arm were pregnant women with multiple pregnancies. However, separate data were not available for these participants. Subgroup analyses were not performed due to the lack of data and the small number of participants. Women with multiple pregnancies are at risk of preterm labour and may benefit from tocolysis. Trials looking at the use of progesterone on this high-risk group of pregnant women are strongly encouraged. Should future trials on the use of progesterone in women with multiple pregnancies be undertaken, we will include them in our subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>The available studies that investigated the use of progesterone thus far did not look at the same form of progesterone. Utrogestan was the progesterone studied by <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Erny-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Erny 1986</LINK>. Micronised natural progesterone was used in <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK>. Seventeen-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the form of Lentogest was used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK> and in the form of Proluton depot in <LINK REF="STD-Chawanpaiboon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawanpaiboon 2011</LINK>. Seventeen-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate was also used in <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>. The name of the progesterone studied was not mentioned in <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK>. The dosage and the route of administration also varied in the available studies. Progesterone was administered intramuscularly in <LINK REF="STD-Chawanpaiboon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawanpaiboon 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>. The progesterone in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Erny-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Erny 1986</LINK> was given orally while the progesterone in <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK> was administered via the vaginal route. This led to the more fundamental question of which would be the most effective route of administration of progesterone for tocolysis. The only study comparing different types of progesterone was conducted by Breart el al (an excluded study), who compared the efficiency of hydroxyprogesterone caproate and chlormadinone acetate for the prevention of preterm labour (<LINK REF="STD-Breart-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Breart 1979</LINK>). The authors found no significant differences between the two groups in either the length of gestation, delay between the beginning of treatment and delivery or other parameters related to prematurity. Studies comparing the routes of administration and the appropriate dosage of progesterone for tocolysis should be encouraged.</P>
<P>Another challenge in this review was the varying concomitant tocolytic agents used with the progesterone. Out of the eight studies, progesterone was used as an independent intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Chawanpaiboon--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawanpaiboon 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Erny-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Erny 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 1960</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goel-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Goel 2011</LINK>, It was used as an adjunct treatment to ritodrine infusion in <LINK REF="STD-Arikan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arikan 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Noblot-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Noblot 1991</LINK>. Progesterone was used as an adjunctive treatment to nifedipine in <LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK> and atosiban in <LINK REF="STD-Facchinetti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Facchinetti 2007</LINK>. Subgroup analyses may be possible with the publication of more studies in each group.<BR/>

<P>We excluded women with the possibility of placental abruptio (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>) because they would likely require delivery instead of being treated with tocolysis. This was not mentioned at the protocol stage but we feel that it is important to state that such women will not be included.</P>
<P>Cervical length measurement was an outcome measure that was not prespecified in the protocol stage. However, we feel that with the advances of ultrasound, cervical length measurements will play an increasingly important role and we have thus added this outcome measure.</P>
<P>We have added the outcome 'birthweight' under the secondary outcomes as we noted subtle differences between the outcome of birthweight &lt; 2.5 kg (primary outcome in this review) and the increase in birthweight (measured in grams) in the studies included in this review.</P>

For 
the first version of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2010</LINK>), the database searches using the predefined search strategy yielded a total of 468 titles. After the initial scanning of titles and abstracts, 457 titles were eliminated as they were deemed irrelevant. Eleven references were retrieved for more detailed evaluation and the full-texts of these studies were scanned by the two review authors (Lin-Lin Su and Miny Samuel). Out of the 11 references, four were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. For the remaining seven references, one was excluded based on the outcome. The remaining six papers reported four randomised trials, involving a total of 192 women. One additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tan--2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2012</LINK>) was ongoing then.</P>
