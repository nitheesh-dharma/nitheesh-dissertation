<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-27 04:40:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people suffer from depression and anxiety. These problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life. Depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems.</P>
<P>&#8216;Collaborative care&#8217; is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety. It involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems. Collaborative care often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist. The case manager has regular contact with the person and organises care, together with the medical doctor and specialist. The case manager may offer help with medication, or access to a &#8216;talking therapy&#8217; to help the patient get better.</P>
<P>Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety.</P>
<P>In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation-liaison) for depression and anxiety. There were problems with the methods in some of the studies. For example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow-up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years. A smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life. Patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-30 01:54:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seventy-nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review. Studies varied in terms of risk of bias.</P>
<P>The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium-term (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long-term (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41). However, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long-term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27).</P>
<P>The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short-term (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium-term (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long-term (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42). No comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long-term.</P>
<P>There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-30 01:57:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are highly prevalent with estimates of up to 15% of the UK population affected at any one time (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011a</LINK>). The prevalence of individual common mental health disorders varies considerably. The one-week prevalence rates from the Office of National Statistics 2007 national survey were 4.4% for generalised anxiety disorder, 3.0% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2.3% for depression, 1.4% for phobias, 1.1% for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and 1.1% for panic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 2009</LINK>). Worldwide, depression affects about 154 million people, and an estimated 5.8% of men and 9.5% of women will experience a depressive episode in any given year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression and anxiety are a major cause of disease burden and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Ustun-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ustun 2004</LINK>) with depression projected to become one of the three leading causes of burden of disease by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2006</LINK>). Symptoms of depression include: depressed mood; loss of interest or pleasure in activities; insomnia or sleeping too much; and fatigue or loss of energy. Symptoms of anxiety differ but can include: excessive worry; feeling tense or restless; significant tension in muscles; and irritability (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). The impact of both disorders on social and occupational functioning, physical health and mortality is also substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Ormel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormel 1999</LINK>), and often anxiety and depression present together, disabling the person further (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011a</LINK>). Depression also accounts for two-thirds of all suicides (<LINK REF="REF-Sartorius-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sartorius 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression and anxiety are often chronic in nature, characterised by high rates of relapse and recurrence. Following their first episode of depression, at least 50% of people will go on to have one or more further episode(s), with the risk of relapse increasing to 70% after the second episode, and as high as 90% after a third episode (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 1991</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-27 04:51:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is estimated that up to 90% of patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety are treated solely in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011a</LINK>). However, the management of these disorders is often suboptimal (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2002</LINK>). The most common method of treatment for common mental health disorders in primary care is psychotropic medication (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011a</LINK>). There are problems with this approach, as patients do not take the medication as prescribed for a variety of reasons including fears of addiction, dependency and side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Lingam--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingam 2002</LINK>). Care for patients with chronic problems like depression is often not proactive; patients do not receive ongoing monitoring and care designed to reduce the burden of disorder and the likelihood of recurrence and relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Buszewicz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buszewicz 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been recognised that improving the treatment of common mental health problems is a very complex task which requires changes to the way care is provided, together with additional resources to develop the appropriate systems to enable primary care professionals to deliver high quality care (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2001</LINK>). Four distinct models of quality improvement in common mental health problems have been identified: training primary care staff, consultation-liaison, replacement/referral, and collaborative care (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The collaborative care model is based on the principles of chronic disease management applied to conditions such as diabetes. The model can involve a large number of different interventions including: screening, education of patients, changes in practice routines, and developments in information technology (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1996</LINK>). Collaborative care models are exemplars of 'complex interventions' which consist of a number of separate elements, where the particular elements that function as the &#8216;active ingredient&#8217; can be difficult to identify (<LINK REF="REF-Medical-Research-Council-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Research Council 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'collaborative care' was first used to describe an intervention which was delivered by a primary care provider and a psychiatrist (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 1995a</LINK>). However, there have been significant developments in the model since that time, and thus clear specification of the meaning of the term in line with current thinking is important. A widely accepted definition of collaborative care used in a systematic review of complex system interventions requires that four key criteria are met: a multi-professional approach to patient care, structured management plan, scheduled patient follow-ups, and enhanced inter-professional communication (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-30 04:16:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research has suggested that a key aspect of effective collaborative care is 'case management' (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>). Case management has been described as a health worker taking responsibility for proactively following up patients, assessing patient adherence to psychological and pharmacological treatments, monitoring patient progress, taking action when treatment is unsuccessful, and delivering psychological support (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 2001</LINK>). Case managers work closely with the primary care provider (who retains overall clinical responsibility) and can receive regular supervision from a mental health specialist (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-30 02:02:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Collaborative care is a model of care for common mental health problems which has generated worldwide interest in its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Although a number of reviews of collaborative care have been published, significant uncertainties remain. Many trials are from the United States, and their generalisability to other contexts and health care systems is unclear. Effectiveness may vary by patient population; collaborative care was not recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) for depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>) or anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011b</LINK>), but was recommended for depression in patients with chronic disease (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). The evidence base for collaborative care is also rapidly developing. Mental health policy in the UK highlights the importance of patient choice in treatments for mental health problems, and collaborative care could provide another option for services to complement other proven treatments. This review will consolidate the developing body of evidence on collaborative care and provide an up-to-date and rigorous assessment to inform policy and practice.</P>

<P>Participant characteristics: Trial participants were either male or female patients of any age.</P>
<P>Diagnosis: Trial participants had a primary diagnosis of depression (including: acute, chronic, persistent, remitted, subthreshold and postnatal) or anxiety (including: generalised anxiety, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias, social anxiety, health anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)). Diagnosis of trial participants was according to one of the following: 1) diagnosis made by primary care provider; 2) Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) criteria; or 3) assessment through self-rated or clinician-rated validated instruments, e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) (<LINK REF="REF-Kroenke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroenke 2001</LINK>), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1987</LINK>) and/or Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1988</LINK>).

These were included only if the majority (&gt;= 50%) of participants were depressed and/or anxious, to ensure that the results of the study related to our target group.</P>
<P>Comorbidity: Trial participants could also have long-term conditions (i.e. asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), as well as a common mental health problem.</P>
<P>Setting: Trial participants could be identified in a variety of healthcare settings (excluding in-patient/specialist mental health), but the intervention had to be predominantly delivered in primary care or community settings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Experimental intervention</HEADING>
<P>This review has adopted four key collaborative care criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2006</LINK>). We regarded studies as collaborative care studies if they fulfilled the following criteria.</P>
<OL>
<LI>A multi-professional approach to patient care. A primary care provider (general practitioner, family physician, primary care physician or a specialist providing undifferentiated medical care) and at least one other health professional (e.g. nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, or pharmacist) or paraprofessional is involved with patient care. For the purposes of the current review, we characterised primary care as medical care involving first contact and ongoing care to patients, regardless of the patient's age, gender or presenting problem (<LINK REF="REF-Boerma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boerma 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001b</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>A structured management plan. Introduction of an organised approach to patient care including access to evidence based management information in the form of guidelines or protocols. Management included either or both pharmacological (e.g. antidepressant medication) and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. patient and provider education, counselling, or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)).</LI>
<LI>Scheduled patient follow-ups. An organised approach to patient follow-up defined as one or more scheduled telephone or in-person follow-up appointments to provide specific interventions, facilitate treatment adherence, or monitor symptoms or adverse effects.</LI>
<LI>Enhanced inter-professional communication. Introduction of mechanisms to facilitate communication between professionals caring for the patient, including team meetings, case conferences, individual consultation/supervision, shared medical records, and patient-specific written or verbal feedback between care-givers.</LI>

<LI>Studies that provided no additional intervention in the usual care group, including no notification of patient depression status.</LI>
<LI>Studies that provided additional interventions in the usual care group (such as education of primary care providers, or notification of patient depression status), but where these aspects of the intervention were applied to both arms, and potentially cancelled out.</LI>
<LI>Studies that enhanced usual care by providing an intervention that the collaborative care arm did not receive e.g. where only primary care clinicians in the usual care arm received training and educational materials on depression evaluation and treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Asarnow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asarnow 2005</LINK>).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">CCDAN's Specialised Register</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK; a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 29,500 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Further details are available from the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC). Reports of trials for inclusion in the registers are collated from routine (weekly) generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization's (WHO's) trials portal (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</A>), drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings, and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Content data were extracted by JA, DR, KL and LG and double-extracted by research assistants/associates. Outcome data were extracted by PB and research assistants. A standardised data extraction form was used for the following characteristics.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The patient population (demographic and clinical characteristics).</LI>
<LI>The nature of the intervention (e.g. types of interventions used, contact between patient and professional, and amount of collaboration between professionals).</LI>

<P>We presented analyses using the following structure. In the analysis of primary outcomes we distinguished all collaborative care interventions, separating studies by diagnosis (depression and anxiety) and age (adolescents and adults). Therefore analyses 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 report outcomes for depression in adults, analyses 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 report outcomes for anxiety in adults and analyses 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 report outcomes for depression in adolescents. No studies reported anxiety outcomes in adolescents.</P>
<P>We separately analysed primary outcomes reported as dichotomous outcomes and as continuous outcomes. Each type of outcome was reported at four time periods: 0 to 6 months, 7 to 12 months, 13 to 24 months, and 25+ months.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of medication use, we applied the same analytical methods. The majority of studies reported medication use using dichotomous outcomes; we excluded the minority reporting continuous outcomes.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of quality of life, we combined analyses across collaborative care interventions for patients with depression and anxiety. The majority of studies reported quality of life using continuous outcomes; we excluded the minority reporting dichotomous outcomes. We split quality of life outcomes into mental health quality of life (e.g. SF-36 emotional role, SF-mental component score), and physical health quality of life (e.g. SF-36 physical functioning, SF-physical component score). We excluded measures that did not report separate mental health and physical health dimensions (e.g. EQ5D overall utility).   </P>
<P>For satisfaction outcomes, we combined analyses across collaborative care intervention for patients with depression and anxiety. We analysed satisfaction outcomes reported as dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes separately. We only reported a single satisfaction outcome point for each study, choosing the outcome closest to six months as the likely best indicator of patient experience of the intervention, unaffected by memory or other bias.</P>
<P>As part of the protocol, we intended to report on social function outcomes. However, a very wide variety of social function outcome measures were reported, and there was a lack of clarity over their definition, scope, and comparability. It was therefore not possible to produce a rigorous synthesis in the time frame of the review. We have extracted social function outcomes and may report on these in a later update of the review when a suitable typology has been developed to ensure consistency in analysis.</P>

<P>As collaborative care is an organisational intervention, cluster trials are commonly used as a way of avoiding bias associated with contamination. We identified studies using cluster randomisation and we adjusted the precision of analyses based on these studies in the meta-analysis using the &#8216;effective sample size&#8217; method outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (section 16.3.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). We calculated the effective sample size of groups in each cluster trial on the basis of the original sample size divided by the &#8216;design effect&#8217;. The design effect was calculated by 1 + (M &#8211; 1) ICC, where M represents the average cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coefficient. We assumed a common design effect across groups. For the base analysis we assumed an intra-class correlation of 0.02 (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>). We examined the effect of adjustment for clustering in a sensitivity analysis using intra-class correlations of 0.00 and 0.05 (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>For &#8216;treatment completion&#8217;, we assessed whether the study used an appropriate 'intention-to-treat' analysis (including all patients in the analysis irrespective of treatment completion) or &#8216;per protocol&#8217; analysis (excluding patients who did not complete treatment according to some defined criterion). We describe the approaches used by individual studies in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>To assess 'loss to follow-up' in included studies, we also calculated the proportion of randomised patients who were lost to follow-up at the 0 to 6 month follow-up across arms, and within each arm, and also calculated the difference in the proportions between collaborative care and usual care arms. </P>
<P>Data for the meta-analysis were missing for many outcomes, usually in terms of missing standard deviations (SDs) and sample sizes. In a change from the study protocol, we did not contact all authors to collect missing data as it was not possible to complete this task in the time available for the review.

Our analysis of outcomes was based on time since randomisation (0 to 6 months, 7 to 12 months, 13 to 24 months, 25+ months), but some collaborative care interventions continue for periods of greater than six months, and it is possible that the longer-term effects of collaborative care (i.e. those in the 7- to 12-month period and beyond) do not reflect any enduring effect of the intervention, but simply reflect those interventions that are extended beyond the initial outcome period (0 to 6 months). To assess this possibility, we coded studies as to whether the intervention is completed in the 0- to 6-month outcome point, or extended beyond that. In a sensitivity analysis, we removed those studies where the intervention extended beyond six months, to assess whether the effects found at the 7- to 12-month time point were significantly different when studies with longer-term interventions were excluded.</P>

<P>We included 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review.</P>
<P>The &#8216;<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>&#8217; table details the characteristics of the studies, including study design, the characteristics of participants, the characteristics of interventions and outcome measures. These are summarised for the 90 comparisons below (figures are rounded to nearest whole numbers, and so the overall percentage does not always equal 100).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>All included comparisons were RCTs; 21 (23%) comparisons used cluster randomisation, where the unit of randomisation was either a primary care practice (n = 19) or a primary care provider (n = 2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Sixty-eight comparisons (76%) were conducted in the US; 10 (11%) in the UK; five (6%) in other European countries (Germany, The Netherlands); and seven (8%) from other countries (Canada, Chile, India, Puerto Rico).</P>
<P>Sixty-nine comparisons (77%) recruited participants from primary care; eight (9%) from community settings; 11 (12%) from specialist physical health settings; and two (2%) used a mixture of primary/community/specialist settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participant characteristics: Seventy-nine comparisons (88%) focused on adults aged 18 to 64 years; two (2%) on adolescents under the age of 18; and nine (10%) on those 65 years or more. For comparisons with available data (n = 70), 33 (47%) included a sample of predominately white origin (classed as 75% or more of the sample). Twenty-one comparisons (23%) included only those who were taking medication for depression and/or anxiety at baseline.</P>
<P>Diagnosis: Eighty-four comparisons (93%) included participants with symptoms of depression or depression and anxiety; six (7%) included only participants with anxiety disorders.</P>
<P>The diagnostic status of participants was identified in 45 comparisons (50%) using Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) or International Classification Disorder (ICD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) criteria. In the remainder, depression or anxiety status at point of entry was defined by self-rated or clinician-rated validated instruments or by the primary care provider without the use of standardised measures or criteria. In three comparisons (3%) participants did not have to have symptoms of depression at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Bartels-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bartels 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kroenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kroenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2007</LINK>). As stated in the protocol, we included these studies since at least 50% of participants had depression at baseline, based on mean score of depression outcome measure or numbers provided.</P>
<P>Sixty-five comparisons (72%) included participants with both subthreshold and diagnosed major depressive or anxiety disorder; 23 (26%) included only those that met diagnostic criteria for major depressive or anxiety disorder; and two (2%) included only subthreshold patients.</P>
<P>Sixteen comparisons (18%) had physical comorbidity as an inclusion criteria, such as, diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ell-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2011</LINK>), cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Dwight_x002d_Johnson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dwight-Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kroenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kroenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Strong 2008</LINK>), epilepsy (<LINK REF="STD-Ciechanowski-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ciechanowski 2010</LINK>), post-stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2007</LINK>), heart disease (<LINK REF="STD-Huffman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Huffman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rollman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rollman 2009</LINK>) or other/mix of conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Bogner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bogner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pyne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pyne 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vera-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vera 2010</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Setting: In 82 comparisons (91%) the main healthcare provider was based in primary care; in eight comparisons (9%) a specialist provided general medical care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All comparisons had to meet the four criteria of collaborative care stated in the protocol although there was considerable variability in the exact nature of the intervention.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A multi-professional approach to patient care: all comparisons involved a primary care provider (generic medical professional) and at least one other health professional (e.g. psychiatrist, nurse, psychologist). In 78 comparisons (87%) the intervention involved contributions from people with three distinct roles (primary care provider, case manager, mental health specialist); 12 (13%) involved two professional roles (primary care provider and case manager, although in these comparisons typically the case manager was a mental health specialist). In 50 comparisons (56%) the case manager was a mental health practitioner; in 40 (44%) the case manager did not have a professional background in mental health.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>A structured management plan: all comparisons included an organised approach to patient care (e.g. evidence based medication algorithm, manualised psychological interventions such as behavioural activation or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)). In 48 comparisons (53%) the intervention included medication management and psychological therapy; 37 (41%) included medication management only; and 5 (6%) psychological therapy only.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Scheduled patient follow-ups: all comparisons included an organised approach to patient follow-up (e.g. scheduled telephone or in-person follow-up appointments). In 49 (54%) of the comparisons the intervention lasted six months or less, in 31 (34%) comparisons the intervention lasted more than six months, and it was unclear how long the intervention lasted in 10 (11%) comparisons.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Enhanced inter-professional communication: all comparisons introduced mechanisms to facilitate communication between professionals (e.g. team meetings, individual consultation/supervision, shared medical records, and patient-specific written or verbal feedback between care-givers).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The duration of the intervention varied across studies and data extraction was complex. Detailed data were not always reported, and the intensity of collaborative care interventions is sometimes contingent on short-term outcomes rather than being standardised for all patients, and may be titrated over time so that an initial high intensity intervention is replaced by low intensity monitoring over the longer-term. We estimated that 32 comparisons (36%) included an intervention of more than six months duration.</P>
<P>We will explore variability between studies in meta-regression analyses and include this in the updated review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison group</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-four (38%) comparisons provided no additional intervention in the usual care group. Fifty-two (58%) comparisons did provide additional interventions in the usual care group (such as education (guidelines or brief training session) for primary care providers on the recognition and management of depression, or notification of patient&#8217;s depression status) but these aspects of the intervention were also applied in the intervention arm. One (1%) comparison enhanced usual care by providing an intervention that the collaborative care arm did not receive (<LINK REF="STD-Asarnow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Asarnow 2005</LINK>). One (1%) comparison did not describe usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Uebelacker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelacker 2011</LINK>).   </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-31 10:41:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have summarised a large body of evidence from 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) which predominantly compare collaborative care with usual care, although there are a small number of comparisons of types of collaborative care, or comparisons of collaborative care and other active interventions. This is the first Cochrane review of this body of evidence and our main findings are outlined below.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-27 10:59:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Collaborative care versus usual care (adults)</HEADING>
<P>In terms of primary outcomes, collaborative care for patients with depression is more effective than usual care in terms of depression outcomes at around six months, 12 months, and 24 months, although the effects were not significant after 24 months. Collaborative care for patients with anxiety is more effective than usual care in terms of anxiety outcomes at around six months, 12 months and 24 months.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, collaborative care for patients with depression increases rates of antidepressant use at around six months, 12 months and 24 months, although the effects are not significant beyond 24 months. Collaborative care for patients with anxiety led to significantly higher rates of anxiety medication use at 12 months.</P>
<P>Collaborative care is more effective than usual care in terms of mental health quality of life at around six months, 12 months and 24 months. Collaborative care is more effective than usual care in terms of physical health quality of life at around 24 months only.</P>
<P>Collaborative care is more effective than usual care in terms of patient satisfaction post-intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Collaborative care was not significantly more effective than usual care in adolescents with depression at around six months or 12 months when measured using continuous outcomes, although the intervention was significantly more effective than usual care at six months when measured using dichotomous outcomes. Collaborative care for adolescents with depression had no significant effects on antidepressant use. There were no significant differences in mental or physical health quality of life or patient satisfaction.</P>
<P>There were a limited number of randomised comparisons of collaborative care versus other interventions. Collaborative care was significantly more effective than feedback alone, but no more effective than consultation-liaison or enhanced referral. There was limited evidence that adding consultation-liaison to collaborative care was significantly more effective than collaborative care alone at around six months only. There were no significant differences between collaborative care and psychotherapy compared with collaborative care alone. There were no differences between collaborative care based on a psychotherapy model, and collaborative care based on a medication model.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-30 03:19:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has included 79 RCTs (90 comparisons) of collaborative care most of which focus on improving mental health outcomes for adults with depression in primary care. This means that collaborative care for anxiety and depression is one of the most well evaluated interventions in mental health in primary care.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of study design</HEADING>
<P>Most studies were individually randomised trials but a proportion (21; 23%) used cluster randomisation. Cluster-RCTs are recommended for testing systems-level interventions such as collaborative care (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>), as patient randomised trials may be vulnerable to contamination i.e. changes in the behaviour of primary care providers influenced by system-level changes such as advice from mental health specialists and routine screening and feedback of patients' mental health status (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2008a</LINK>). However, cluster-RCTs generally require larger patient samples and may be vulnerable to other sources of bias (selective patient recruitment after cluster randomisation; baseline imbalance due to the smaller number of clusters recruited; loss of clusters; and incorrect analysis). This review explored the inclusion of cluster-RCTs in sensitivity analysis and there was no evidence that the main outcomes were sensitive to the inclusion of such trials, or the estimates of the level of clustering used to estimate outcomes in the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Although the majority of the included studies have been conducted in the US, more studies are being conducted worldwide, and the positive outcomes reported in the US do seem to be replicated in other countries in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Chew_x002d_Graham-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chew-Graham 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gensichen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gensichen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 2012</LINK>) and wider contexts (<LINK REF="STD-Araya-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Araya 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2007</LINK>). However, given the more limited evidence base, the main findings of the review need to be interpreted with more caution when considering other settings.</P>
<P>Originally, collaborative care studies were conducted on patients with depression. However, more recently the study of collaborative care has diversified, recruiting participants with anxiety disorders, and patients with diagnosed physical health conditions (e.g. specialist centres treating people with lung cancer or diabetes).</P>
<P>Clinical diagnosis was not necessarily a prerequisite for inclusion in the studies and therefore we included a wide range of symptoms and/or disorders (subthreshold, mild and major depression, chronic, postnatal). Studies that use diagnostic criteria to screen participants for eligibility are often prioritised over studies that use self-report outcome measures or clinician judgement, particularly as evidence based guidelines often exclude the latter from their reviews of the literature (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Whilst positive outcomes may be more likely when interventions are targeted to a specific diagnostic group (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>), studies where interventions are offered based on levels of symptoms rather than research diagnoses may be more representative of routine practice. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of intervention</HEADING>
<P>Collaborative care is a complex intervention which is difficult to define precisely. This review based inclusion and exclusion criteria on a published definition of collaborative care (<LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2006</LINK>). Whilst this was considered the most comprehensive and internally consistent definition to date, there was still variation in what was delivered as part of a collaborative care model in relation to all four intervention criteria.</P>
<P>In terms of a multi-professional approach some studies included just two health professionals (primary care provider and case manager/and or mental health specialist), while others included a primary care provider, case manager and a mental health specialist. There was variation in the amount of structure in the management plan, where some studies were highly prescriptive (e.g. providing a written manual for the primary care provider and/or the case manager to follow) and others were less so (providing written treatment guidelines and encouraging individualised treatment plans). There was variation also in the intensity of the intervention in each study in terms of number of follow-ups scheduled (ranging from 1 to 20+); method of delivery (face-to-face, telephone or a combination); and session duration. This variation in &#8216;key ingredients&#8217; of collaborative care complicates the interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>We excluded studies from this review examining stepped care models where access to collaborative care was restricted and reserved for a small proportion of participants meeting specific criteria, as it would have been impossible to assess the added value of the collaborative care element. This may be an important consideration, particularly in the UK where stepped care is the recommended service model for depression and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of comparison</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies compared collaborative care with &#8216;usual care&#8217;. A limitation of this review is that 'usual care&#8217; is hard to define and included studies did not clearly describe the key elements. Many of the most traditional &#8216;usual care&#8217; studies also included some limited level of intervention (distribution of treatment guidelines, informing patients of depression status, training and education of primary care practitioners). The evidence for these interventions delivered in isolation is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2005</LINK>) but such interventions could result in a lower treatment effect.  </P>
<P>Several studies have compared collaborative care with another active treatment (such as consultation-liaison or enhanced referral) but the numbers of available comparisons is low and confidence in the conclusions about their relative value is limited.  </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-31 10:41:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the 90 comparisons were included in analyses of depression outcomes, enabling estimates of the effects of collaborative care in the short-term and medium-term with a high level of precision.</P>
<P>We found clinical and methodological heterogeneity in terms of participants, interventions, comparisons and outcome measures. In primary analyses, the value of the I² statistic for the continuous measure of depression outcome at six months was 34%; 'moderate' according to recommended criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). For dichotomous measures of depression outcome at six months it was 71% indicating 'substantial' heterogeneity according to recommended criteria. Using the same criteria, 'considerable' heterogeneity was apparent in the analysis of antidepressant use at six months (I² statistic = 81%). The 95% confidence intervals around the I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate, calculated using the Stata command <I>heterogi,</I> are presented in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>. We used random-effects models in all analyses.</P>
<P>We did not identify any adverse outcomes. Trials in this area of research rarely record adverse events.</P>
<P>Applying 'Risk of bias' criteria to the studies has identified methodological limitations in the studies, although some of these (e.g. blinding of participants and clinicians) reflect the reality of conducting complex intervention trials in practice. Some studies rated as &#8216;high risk' of bias for &#8216;blinding of participants&#8217; used self-reported outcomes which may not be as vulnerable to bias as an unblinded external observer. There was no evidence that removing studies at high risk of bias (assessed in terms of allocation concealment) had a large effect on the estimate of treatment effect in the main analyses. Studies varied in whether they reported outcomes in terms of continuous measures or dichotomous outcomes, and there is a risk of bias if this represents selective reporting. However, this is very difficult to judge without access to study protocols.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-30 03:27:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the published protocol, we have made several changes in response to peer review, and as a result of internal discussions, on the best way to synthesise data about a complex and multifaceted intervention. These changes are documented in line with good practice. </P>
<P>We did not contact all authors to collect missing data. Given the size and complexity of the review this would have required multiple requests for data from many authors and study timelines did not allow for this task.</P>
<P>There are a number of analyses that we had planned, but given the size and complexity of the review we have been unable to complete such analyses because of time constraints.</P>
<P>We were unable to conduct a rigorous and reliable analysis of social function outcomes in the time frame of the review, as the measures reported were highly varied and their comparability difficult to judge without extensive work on individual scales. We will add these outcomes at a later date.</P>
<P>The protocol discussed several subgroup analyses and exploratory meta-regression. We analysed outcomes separately for adolescents and adults, and for interventions targeting patients with depression and anxiety. We did not conduct subgroup analyses for country, location of recruitment, ethnicity, or aspects of the intervention, or conduct the exploratory meta-regression. Exploration of the impact of such factors will benefit from a multivariate approach which can assess the relative importance of factors, rather than a series of single subgroup analyses which may be confounded with other important factors. Such a meta-regression analysis will require extensive imputation of missing outcome data, and translation of continuous and dichotomous outcomes into a common format. These activities could not be completed in the time frame of the review, but we will add these at a later date.</P>
<P>We did not extract data from studies that reported antidepressant medication as a continuous outcome only, or from studies that reported quality of life as a dichotomous outcome only, or as a general quality of life measure only that combined physical and mental health. In all cases this represented less than 5% of studies.</P>
<P>We extracted data on satisfaction at six months only. Although it is possible that satisfaction could change over time, our judgement was that satisfaction measures are fundamentally associated with views of the treatment process, and thus measures close to treatment receipt are much more likely to be accurate and unconfounded by memory issues.</P>
<P>We have included analyses of collaborative care plus enhancement versus collaborative care. We accept that such studies provide an assessment of the effects of the enhancement, not collaborative care. However, we felt that such analyses were of relevance, as it is an important clinical issue as to whether the effects of collaborative care can be increased by adding other features to the basic model.</P>
<P>Our analysis split outcomes into four time periods based on time since randomisation. The nature of collaborative care means that interventions are sometimes provided over longer periods of time, and thus it is possible that long-term effects of collaborative care (i.e. those in the 12-month period and beyond) do not reflect any enduring effect of the intervention, but simply reflect those interventions that are extended beyond the initial outcome period (0 to 6 months). We conducted a sensitivity analysis, removing studies where the intervention extended beyond six months, to assess whether the effects found at the 7- to 12-month time point were significantly different when studies with longer-term interventions were excluded. In both outcomes, the effect of collaborative care at 7 to 12 months was reduced, which supports the suggestion that long-term effects on outcome are more likely when the intervention is also conducted over the longer-term. However, the effects of collaborative care are still statistically significant at both times points even with longer-term interventions removed, and this issue needs further research.</P>
<P>We did not contact all first authors or experts in the field to check for additional studies to those found through our searches.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-27 11:28:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of reviews have examined the effectiveness of collaborative care, enhanced care, disease management and complex system interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Badamgarav-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badamgarav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bijl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijl 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gensichen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gensichen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kates 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neumeyer_x002d_Gromen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumeyer-Gromen 2004</LINK>). These reviews have used a mixture of narrative and meta-analyses to examine outcomes including: depression symptoms and caseness, patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment and cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>These reviews mainly include RCTs. A previous review conducted in 2006 included 37 RCTs of collaborative care (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2006</LINK>) using broader inclusion criteria for collaborative care (<LINK REF="STD-Katon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katon 2001</LINK>). A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Thota-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thota 2012</LINK>) identified a further 32 studies between 2004 and 2009. The current review demonstrates the increase in activity in the implementation and evaluation of collaborative care, although some of the differences in the numbers of studies included in different reviews represent differences in exact inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Like the current review, all of the published reviews concluded collaborative care was effective in the short-term and medium-term, and some reviews also considered longer-term outcomes, reporting trends for significant effects up to five years (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Less evidence has been reported for other outcomes such as quality of life and patient satisfaction although some previous reviews have reported potential positive outcomes for collaborative care in terms of patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="REF-Badamgarav-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badamgarav 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neumeyer_x002d_Gromen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumeyer-Gromen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thota-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thota 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not identify any reviews that examined collaborative care for adults with anxiety; across different age ranges (including adolescents and older age) and compared with other active treatments (such as consultation-liaison and enhanced referral).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-27 11:34:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has demonstrated clear and robust evidence of effectiveness for collaborative care in improving depression outcomes in the short- and medium-term.</P>
<P>These findings have important implications for current clinical guidelines for depression. The overall finding that collaborative care is associated with improvements in depression is based on a large and varied database and is highly likely to be rigorous. However, debate will continue over the magnitude of the benefits. The standardised mean difference (SMD) demonstrated in the main analyses, although significant, is modest by current convention (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsey 1990</LINK>), and less than some important comparison treatments (such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) when evaluated in contexts other than primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Although there is a lack of consensus on &#8216;minimally clinically important differences&#8217; in mental health, a SMD of 0.5 has been used previously as a criteria for adoption in the UK, and the data in this review shows effects which are less than this, and some benefits (such as those on physical health quality of life) are statistically significant but potentially of limited clinical significance.</P>
<P>However, the benefits of collaborative care are similar to other treatments (such as CBT and other psychological therapies) when delivered in primary care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Cape-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cape 2010</LINK>) and it is important to note that the benefits, although modest, do seem to endure over time, possibly reflecting the chronic disease management basis of the collaborative care intervention.</P>
<P>Currently the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK only recommends collaborative care at step 3 for people with long-term physical conditions and depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). This current review did not find that excluding studies in patients with long-term physical conditions made a substantive difference to the findings of the review (main analysis SMD -0.34; sensitivity analysis excluding studies in patients with comorbidity SMD -0.29). As noted previously, such simple comparisons are problematic, as there are many additional differences between studies that could account for this variation, beyond the types of patients recruited. For example, collaborative care is a complex intervention and there is significant variation in the exact nature of the intervention in the included studies, as well as differences in patient populations, contexts, comparisons, and design. Replication of an earlier meta-regression including the new studies is required (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2006</LINK>), accounting for the full range of studies and relevant characteristics, and we will conduct this as an update to this review.  </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-30 03:34:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of collaborative care for depression in the short- and medium-term is robust. There is a need for further research in collaborative care for anxiety, in patients with depression and long-term physical health conditions, and in different age groups (adolescents and older age). Comparisons of collaborative care models with other interventions would also be useful to better determine its optimal place in current clinical pathways.</P>
<P>Exploration of the moderators and mediators of the effects of collaborative care (<LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 2002</LINK>) might provide useful guidance on how current models could enhance effectiveness through greater focus on &#8216;active ingredients&#8217; and better targeting of patient populations most likely to benefit.</P>
<P>Improvements in the way research is reported are required. We were unable to make accurate judgements about many risk of bias issues, and we could not include large numbers of outcomes in the analyses because key data were missing. Researchers should also be encouraged to include more consistent data on the actual interventions included in collaborative care studies and report adverse events.</P>

<P>The methods for this review are based on the revised protocol published online in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2007</LINK>), which is an update of the original protocol to take into account the most recent version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> available to authors (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the protocol we intended to report on social function outcomes. However, a very wide variety of social outcome measures were reported, and there was a lack of clarity over their definition, scope, and comparability.

<P>2) a structured management plan: Step 1: those scoring 19 or less on HRSD received psychoeducational group and those scoring &gt; 19 received psychoeducational group plus assessment for ADs. Step 2: after 6 week reassessment those scoring 12 or less received two booster sessions at weeks 9 and 12 and those scoring &gt; 12 were referred for PCP reassessment to initiate ADs or adjust ADs. Psychoeducation topics included a manual with information on symptoms and causes of depression, treatment options, scheduling positive activities, problem-solving techniques, and basic cognitive and relapse-prevention techniques. PCPs delivered a brief structured pharmacotherapy protocol using a standard medication algorithm to ensure adequate dose and duration of treatment (fluoxetine, amitriptyline, or imipramine). Group leaders monitored medication adherence and attendance at follow-up visits for patients receiving pharmacotherapy</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: The CM psychoeducational intervention group consisted of seven weekly sessions and two booster sessions at weeks 9 and 12. CM monitored AD adherence and attendance at follow-up visits for patients receiving pharmacotherapy</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: CM co-ordinated further management with PCPs if needed and usually communicated with doctors through alert notes and arranging appointments for patients, MH specialist provided clinical supervision</P>

<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care physicians (PCP), nurse with MH experience (CM), psychiatrist (MH specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: Baseline assessment and then telephone assessments (structured but not scripted) to assess symptoms and gaining information on treatment recommendations and assessing adherence. Prompted by computer generation the CM discussed topics such as depression as a treatable medical illness, treatment options (including psychotherapy and medications), coping skills for stress, risk factors for depression, suicide prevention strategies, and reinforcing follow-up with the PCP. Educational materials on these topics were also sent to the patient. Treatment recommendations made by the CM were general and often referred the PCP back to a particular stage of the depression treatment algorithm, modelled after the AHRQ depression guidelines.</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: Following baseline telephone assessment follow up was attempted every 3 weeks during 16 week treatment period</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: After each assessment the results were fed back to the PCP using summary letters, including the scores of the depression measures and a clinical interpretation of them. All PCPs had contact with the MH specialist as needed. CM had weekly supervision with MH specialist to facilitate treatment planning and follow-up.</P>
<P>Control: Treatment as usual enhanced as included patient evaluation and diagnosis, patient education, provider education and practice guidelines, final outcome and provider feedback</P>

<P>Contains the four elements of collaborative care:</P>
<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care provider (PCP), pharmacist (CM), psychiatrist (MH specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: Assessment of severity of psychopathology, potential stressors and other predisposing factors and patient education was provided. Information on depression and the role of ADs was presented (including potential therapeutic effects/adverse effects). Patients were advised of other treatment options and resources available. CMs were permitted to titrate ADs consistent with clinical practice guidelines. CMs could also prescribe ancillary drugs but if a change in AD drugs was indicated, approval from the PCP was required. As patients improved CMs identified neglected activities and encouraged patients to resume them. Patients were advised to contact the clinic if they were considering the discontinuation of antidepressants at any time in the future.<BR/>
</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: Assessment plus 5 telephone calls at key junctures in recovery process and 2 clinic visits at 6 and 24 weeks.</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: All contacts were recorded in the medical record in the form of a detailed progress note. CM discussed with PCP by phone or messaging system any need for change to ADs. At the end of treatment a comprehensive summary of the treatment course and patient disposition was entered into records. Weekly case conferences with CMs and MH specialist clarified diagnostic issues and more clearly delineate treatment plans. MH specialists were also available for off-site telephone consultation on an as-needed basis for more pertinent issues</P>
<P>Control: Treatment as usual including brief information on the AD, therapeutic end points, and side effects in a manner consistent with patient education routinely delivered by the pharmacy. The referring PCP was notified of assignment and subsequent treatment and follow-up were left to the provider's discretion</P>

<P>2) a structured management plan: stepped-care model including: Step (1) choice of either watchful waiting or AD. CM encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted and administered using software package. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) clinically assessed; (2) educated and activated; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers. Follow-up encounters monitored symptoms, medication adherence, and side-effects. Step (2) If the patient did not respond to the initial AD, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note. The pharmacist also provided non-scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side-effects or problems with non-adherence. Step (3) If the patient did not respond to 2 AD trials, the protocol was to recommend a telepsychiatry consultation followed by additional treatment recommendations to the PCP</P>

<P>Contains the four elements of collaborative care:</P>
<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care provider (PCP), nurse (CM), psychologist/psychiatrist (MH specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: CMs motivated and coached patients to solve problems and set goals for improved medication adherence and self-care (e.g. exercising and self-monitoring of blood-pressure and glucose levels). Self-care materials, including a help book, a video compact disk on depression care, a booklet and other materials on chronic disease management, and self-monitoring devices (e.g., blood-pressure or blood-glucose meters) were provided. Patients worked collaboratively with CMs and PCPs to establish individualised clinical and self-care goals. CMs monitored the patient&#8217;s progress with respect to management of depression, control of medical disease, and self-care activities. Treatment protocols guided adjustments of commonly used medicines in patients who did not achieve specific goals. CMs followed patients proactively to provide support for medication adherence</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: Assessment plus telephone or in-person contact once or twice a month until the patient achieved his or her treatment goals (treat-to-target). After completion of recovery and a maintenance plan, patients were followed every 4 to 6 weeks by telephone calls from the CM to review adherence, lab test results and depression score.</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: CM communicated recommended medication changes to PC. CMs received weekly supervision with MH specialist team to review new cases and patient progress</P>
<P>Control: Treatment as usual enhanced as patients were advised to consult with their PCP to receive care for depression, diabetes and/or CHD. With patient permission, PCPs were notified about depression and poor medical disease control. All study laboratory reports and results were entered into the electronic medical record</P>

<P>2) a structured management plan: Patient choice of CBT, medication or both during 10-12 weeks. The computerised CBT programme included 5 generic modules (education, self-monitoring, hierarchy development, breathing training, and relapse prevention) and 3 modules (cognitive restructuring and exposure to internal and external stimuli) tailored to each anxiety disorder and included psycho-educational materials and instructions for skills practice and exposure. CMs entered data which then created a personalised workbook and homework assignments. The medication algorithm emphasised selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), dose optimisation, adverse effect monitoring, followed by second and third step combinations of 2 ADs or an AD and benzodiazepine for non-response. CMs provided adherence monitoring, counselling to avoid alcohol and optimise sleep hygiene and behavioural activity. Non-responders could receive more of the same (stepping up) or the alternative modality (stepping over) for up to 3 more steps of treatment. After treatment completion, patients were entered into continued care and received monthly follow-up telephone calls to reinforce CBT skills, medication adherence, or both.

<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care physician (PCP), nurse/psychologist (CM), academic PCP/psychiatrist (MH specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: CM educates using a brochure and a videotape attempting to form a therapeutic alliance and encouraging patient to become an active participant in depression care. CMs discuss treatment preferences (including ADs and psychotherapy), offers follow-up for 1-year period and coordinates depression care with patient&#8217;s PCP. CMs track clinical progress and monitor treatment side-effects at each contact or delivers problem solving therapy (PST). A 3-step treatment algorithm was developed allowing treatment team to establish a treatment plan for each patient&#8217;s need over time. Step 1: Start AD or PST. Non-response becomes step 2: alternative AD or from AD to PST, or vice versa. Non-response at step 2 is discussed and considered for psychiatric consultation and step 3: combination of treatments.

<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care provider/neurologist (PCP), nurse (CM), study physician (Specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: CM intervention consisted of 3 steps: (1) Activating stroke survivors and their families to understand and accept depression diagnosis and treatment (a structured psychoeducation session), (2) Initiating ADs (CM recommends PCP prescribe AD using algorithm, typically a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor); and (3) Monitoring treatment effectiveness (scripted bimonthly telephone calls to assess depression symptoms, medication side effects, and adherence). Non-response after 4 weeks led to increase in AD dose. CMs had weekly meetings with Specialist and treatment recommendations were fed back to PCP by CM</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: 7 sessions in 12 weeks (One face-to-face and bimonthly telephone calls)</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: CMs recommended AD to PCP and met with Specialist weekly and fed back treatment recommendations to PCP</P>
<P>Control: Patients received an identical number of baseline and telephone sessions to serve as a control for an attention effect. Instead of depression, these sessions focused on recognition and monitoring of stroke symptoms and risks</P>

<P>2) a structured management plan: CMs were instructed to develop a therapeutic relationship and follow patients for 4 months through primary care outpatient appointments and community rehabilitation. CM involved collaborative problem definition and shared patient-provider treatment planning (based on post-traumatic concerns). CMs intervened in resolution of these concerns and also provided a psychotherapy module specifically targeting post-traumatic distress and substance use. The psychoeducational component began with a review of the traumatic event, followed by a discussion of related emotions, cognitions, and possible future post-traumatic symptoms, and closed with suggested coping strategies including algorithms for contacting the CM. The motivational enhancement techniques focused on the evaluation of readiness to change and implementation of a motivational interview targeting post-traumatic alcohol and drug use</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: Face-to-face whilst inpatient and then follow for 4 months (typically telephone)</P>

<P>Contains the four elements of collaborative care:</P>
<P>1) a multi-professional approach to patient care: Primary care provider (PCP), masters level case manager (CM), psychologist/psychiatrist (MH specialist)</P>
<P>2) a structured management plan: The intervention combined case management and psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments as a stepped-care procedure. For the first 6 months after injury, all patients received continuous case management delivered by CM. CMs and other intervention team members developed a comprehensive care plan that addressed medical and psychosocial complications and coordinated care across surgical inpatient, primary care outpatient, specialty mental health, and community service settings. Patients had 24 hour 7 day a week access to CM pager and CMs developed a therapeutic alliance that facilitated the delivery of evidence-based interventions for alcohol abuse and PTSD. The CM motivational intervention consisted of an inpatient session followed by as-needed booster sessions (test results, pros and cons of alcohol, importance of change, specific goals for alcohol, and action plans). Three months after the injury patients with PTSD were given preference of CBT, pharmacotherapy, or combined treatment (delivered by expert psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy consultants). The CBT intervention included psychoeducation, muscle relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and graded exposure. The psychopharmacological intervention consisted of an initial psychiatric evaluation and medication targeting PTSD. CMs provided education about the diagnosis and facilitated the entry of patients into evidence-based treatments. During the evidence-based PTSD intervention, CMs performed brief assessments of adherence to medication therapy and symptom relapse. The stepped-care procedure included relapse prevention and community integration components. From 6 to 12 months after the injury, non-responsive patients received combination treatments and CMs periodically reassessed symptoms, function, and rehabilitation.</P>
<P>3) scheduled patient follow-ups: Continuous for 6 months and then periodic 6-12 months for those that remained symptomatic</P>
<P>4) enhanced inter-professional communication: CMs coordinated linkages and interfaced with PCPs and met with MH specialist weekly to review cases and protocol procedures</P>
