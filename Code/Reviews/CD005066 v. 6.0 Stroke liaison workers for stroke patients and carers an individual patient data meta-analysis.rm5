<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-25 11:39:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Many patients experience depression, anxiety and isolation after a stroke. These post-stroke problems can lead to subsequent poor health, low mood or increased caring burden. It seems reasonable to expect that providing more emotional and psychological support in addition to appropriate information about stroke and services available might help to reduce anxiety, improve mood and improve health or satisfaction. In this review, we evaluated 16 studies (involving 4759 participants) of healthcare workers or volunteers (a 'stroke liaison worker') providing education and social support (including counselling) and liaison with services. Overall, there do not appear to be any significant benefits for patients in terms of their perceived health, mood, activities or participation. Patients appeared to be more satisfied that someone had really listened to them, and carers appeared to be more satisfied with aspects of the care provided. It also appears that patients with mild to moderate disability may benefit from a reduction in disability and death as a result of the input from the stroke liaison worker. The reason for this is not yet clear and further research is required.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched February 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009) and four other databases. We performed a cited reference search, searched conference proceedings and trials registers, checked reference lists and contacted authors and trial investigators.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-03 20:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 16 trials involving 4759 participants. Analysis did not show a significant overall difference for subjective health status (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.04, P = 0.34) or extended activities of daily living (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.11, P = 0.22). There was no overall significant effect for the outcome of carer subjective health status (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.14, P = 0.37). Patients with mild to moderate disability (Barthel 15 to 19) had a significant reduction in dependence (odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.87, P = 0.006). This would equate to 10 fewer dependent patients (95% CI 17 fewer to 4 fewer) for every 100 patients seen by the stroke liaison worker. Similar results were seen for the outcome of death or dependence for the subgroup with Barthel 15 to 19 (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81, P = 0.002). This risk difference equates to 11 fewer dead or dependent patients (95% CI 17 fewer to 4 fewer) for every 100 patients seen by the stroke liaison worker.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-25 11:39:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is a major cause of disability and handicap, with an incidence of three to five per 1000 in people aged 45 to 84 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 1997</LINK>). The majority of people survive their stroke, but a third to a half remain functionally dependent after one year (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1994</LINK>). This is associated with significant psychosocial problems for both patients and their carers, which may also occur independent of physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotila-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotila 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholte 1998</LINK>). The burden of such problems may increase as a result of demographic change and reductions in age-specific stroke case fatality (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonita-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonita 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of different approaches have been evaluated to try to lessen these psychosocial problems. These include provision of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-OSST-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">OSST 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wade-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1992a</LINK>), information leaflets (<LINK REF="REF-Mant-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mant 1998</LINK>), antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2008</LINK>), counselling, education (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1999</LINK>) and social support (<LINK REF="REF-Friedland-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedland 1992</LINK>). While some studies did find positive effects of these interventions, none were found to have a significant impact on psychological outcomes or quality of life, though this may have been due to type II statistical error.</P>
<P>Support following discharge from hospital, information about stroke and available resources, and practical help have been identified by patients and carers as services that they would value (<LINK REF="REF-Greveson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greveson 1991</LINK>). A stroke liaison worker can be defined as someone whose aim is to increase participation and improve wellbeing for patients and carers. Typically they provide emotional and social support and information to stroke patients and their families and liaise with services with the aim of improving aspects of participation and quality of life for patients with stroke, their carers, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Lilley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilley 2003</LINK>). This multifaceted role distinguishes stroke liaison workers from therapists whose aim is to treat a single problem such as improving activities (rehabilitation) or knowledge (information provision). A stroke liaison worker may be a health or social care professional, or be from the voluntary sector. Such services have been evaluated under a range of different names, such as 'social work' (<LINK REF="REF-Christie-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christie 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towle-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towle 1989</LINK>), 'specialist nurse support' (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1996</LINK>), 'stroke family care worker' (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1997</LINK>) and 'stroke family support organiser' (<LINK REF="REF-Mant-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mant 1999</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, such services have been grouped under the generic title of 'stroke liaison worker'. There has been one descriptive review of published trials of 'support workers' within the context of a broader review of non-drug strategies aimed at reducing psycho-social problems after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2000</LINK>). No meta-analysis of these studies has yet been attempted.</P>

<P>Survivors of acute stroke or their closest informal carer or both. A clinical definition of stroke was used: rapidly developing clinical symptoms and/or signs of focal, and at times global loss of cerebral function (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 1988</LINK>). We included studies that included transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients since TIA is part of the same disease spectrum and patients with TIAs, while seldom having reduced activities, may have reduced participation and a high level of anxiety regarding stroke recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Veenendaal-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Veenendaal 1996</LINK>). Participants must be adult (aged 16 years or over). We did not include trials that address carer needs alone (and do not include patients).</P>

<P>Referral to a stroke liaison worker. Such a worker would typically provide a multifaceted service including more than one of: education and information provision, social support and liaison with other services (<LINK REF="REF-OSST-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">OSST 2003</LINK>). Often this intervention is provided from the point of patient discharge from hospital. We considered trials assessing workers of any professional background relevant, including health or social care professionals or volunteers. We excluded studies where the intervention was judged to be single-faceted. This distinction is to separate the stroke liaison worker interventions from trials of, for example, information provision alone (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2001</LINK>). Similarly, we excluded trials of therapist-delivered physical rehabilitation or psychological interventions on their own. The control group received usual care.</P>

<P>See the 'Specialized register' section in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/STROKE/frame.html">Cochrane Stroke Group</A> module.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, which was last searched by the Managing Editor on 2 February 2009. The register was searched for trials coded in the following categories: counselling, social support, therapists, support workers, carer training and information giving.</P>
<P>In addition, we searched the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2009) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), CINAHL (1982 to 2009), ASSIA (1987 to 2009), PsycINFO (1967 to 2009) and Social Science Citation Index (1956 to 2009).</P>
<P>In order to identify further published and unpublished studies, we carried out a Cited Reference Search using Web of Science, checked the reference lists of identified relevant trials and contacted authors of relevant papers and investigators in this area of stroke services trials. We also searched the following relevant conference proceedings and trials registers: European Stroke Conference proceedings (1999 to 2008) and The Stroke Center (<A HREF="http://www.strokecenter.org">www.strokecenter.org</A>) (December 2008).<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods of the review: selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The lead review author (GE) first excluded obviously irrelevant articles. Two review authors (GE, PL) then independently reviewed the retrieved abstracts of papers identified. We excluded papers that clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria at this stage, and recorded the reason. We obtained a full-text copy of all possibly relevant papers, and the same review authors (GE and PL) also independently assessed these according to pre-defined inclusion criteria. It was our intention that Simon Winner and Martin Dennis would moderate if there was disagreement: this was not required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Contact with trialists and data collection</HEADING>
<P>We contacted the contact trialist or lead investigator and invited them to join a collaborative review process. We requested individual patient data and invited trialists to meet in Glasgow, UK to discuss the development of the review. (The members of this collaborative group are listed in the <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to the meeting, we asked trialists for additional information including information on design characteristics, the study population, the intervention, outcome measures used and length of follow up, as well as additional information regarding the intervention that may not have been apparent in the published papers. If we could not contact any trialists, the lead review author (GE) and supervising review author (PL) completed these trial detail grids independently. We then used details about the intervention to construct subgroups according to the apparent primary emphasis of the intervention (liaison, education and information provision, social support).</P>
<P>At the trialists meeting, held on 4 March 2005, we discussed the intentions of the review process and methods. We invited trialists to comment on the classification system developed for grouping trials. The trialists felt that the initial system developed (analysis by primary emphasis as suggested in the original protocol) did not adequately describe the similar and differing studies. This discussion led to the development of a subsequent classification (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) which we used for the primary analysis.</P>
<P>The group also suggested additional subgroup analyses. These included analysis of the intervention by the profession of the individual providing the intervention. We also planned to present the results stratified by timing of referral to a stroke liaison worker (less than six months after stroke, more than six months after stroke).</P>
<P>Analysis by patient characteristics included subgroups defined by sex, age (less than 65 years old, and 65 years or older), the presence or absence of a main carer and patient functional status at baseline. We considered this last subgroup because one trial in particular had suggested that patients with mild to moderate functional dependence had the most to gain from the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Bradford" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford</LINK>). For this reason, we used the same definitions of dependence as in the original trial (severe dependence: Barthel score less than 15; mild to moderate dependence: Barthel score 15 to 19; independent: Barthel score 20). We made all subgroup definitions prior to data analysis and blind to review data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of quality</HEADING>
<P>We did not use a quality score for eligible trials (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>). Nevertheless, we coded the trials with regard to quality of randomisation procedure, method of consent, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding of patients and carers, blinding of outcome assessor, and handling of withdrawals and drop-outs (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>We classified outcome measures according to which domain they were assessing (activities of daily living, extended activities of daily living, participation, dependency, mental health, subjective health status, knowledge about stroke, use of services and satisfaction). Satisfaction was assessed across 17 domains for patients and 16 domains for carers. Most of the scales used were ordinal or continuous. If the same measure had been used in different studies, we calculated a mean difference (MD) across trials using the Review Manager software, RevMan 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We did not perform a meta-analysis where grossly differing outcome measures precluded combination. Where it was possible to dichotomise the data, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. Where it was not possible to dichotomise the data, we summarised the effects on outcome in terms of direction of effect (in favour of intervention or control), and the size of the effect (in terms of standardised mean differences (SMD)). We have presented results separately for patients and carers for each domain of outcome.</P>
<P>Prior to data analysis, we constructed an analysis plan which included the a priori selection of outcome measures that we would use in the review process. We used this pre-planned method where trialists had evaluated an outcome with more than one outcome measure. Where one measure (e.g. Frenchay Activities Index) was used by several trials, we selected the most commonly used measure. There was the potential risk of the review author selecting an outcome measure that had achieved more positive results, thus influencing the results, and it was hoped that the prior planning of analysis would reduce that risk.</P>
<P>In the analysis of satisfaction, due to differences between trials in the questions that were asked, it became necessary to select questions for comparison. We selected questions for analysis only if they appeared in two or more studies. All satisfaction questions involved a Likert scale with four separate categories of satisfaction (highly satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied and highly dissatisfied). We contracted the results into a dichotomised outcome (satisfied or dissatisfied) and entered data into an analysis to produce an OR for reporting being satisfied.</P>
<P>We cross-checked individual patient data for completeness on receipt. In addition, we cross-checked them with published data. For subgroup analysis, we split data into separate databases and analysed them separately. We used double data entry to enter data into RevMan to ensure the avoidance of simple errors. We checked the direction of effect for each outcome measure in each trial and cross-checked all tables on completion for errors and completeness.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Review process results</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy identified 17,734 titles to be reviewed (search date July 2009). From these titles we selected 71 studies as being of possible relevance to the review. Where possible, we sought the full text of these studies or the abstract where a full paper was not available. Of these studies, we considered 57 to be unsuitable for inclusion: eight were not randomised controlled trials, eight evaluated interventions for caregivers only, a further 18 evaluated education interventions only, 10 evaluated some form of physical rehabilitation, six evaluated a single-faceted intervention only such as social support alone, five evaluated only a sub-population (such as post-surgical subarachnoid haemorrhages only), and two evaluated the impact of chronic disease management programmes (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selected trials</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy identified 14 published randomised trials, and we identified a further two unpublished trials following contact with trialists. One of the unpublished studies evaluated two interventions in separate arms (the input of a volunteer or a psychologist for problem-solving therapy compared to usual care) (<LINK REF="STD-Leeds" TYPE="STUDY">Leeds</LINK>). The other unpublished study evaluated three separate interventions, alone or combined. These included a stroke family support worker (social), a psychology intervention (psychology) and an occupational therapy intervention (physical). We considered only the stroke family support worker and the psychology arms of the study to be relevant for inclusion and where these elements were combined, we excluded the data (<LINK REF="STD-Liverpool" TYPE="STUDY">Liverpool</LINK>).</P>
<P>We obtained individual patient data for 12 studies, and obtained additional tabulated data for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philadelphia-_x0028_STAIR_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Philadelphia (STAIR)</LINK>).

<P>The 16 trials came from four countries (Australia, Netherlands, UK and USA). Most were based in city hospitals and evaluated services in urban populations. Thirteen studies described adequate allocation concealment: eleven studies performed blinding of the final outcome assessor and two studies performed additional patient blinding by a means of delayed or modified consent (<LINK REF="STD-Edinburgh" TYPE="STUDY">Edinburgh</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>), the justification of which is described separately (<LINK REF="REF-Boter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boter 2003</LINK>).<BR/>The intervention characteristics for the primary analysis are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. Four interventions were classified as employing a proactive and structured approach to the intervention. Eight interventions were reactive and flexible, while six interventions employed a proactive but focused approach.</P>
<P>Available data for some outcomes were very limited and not combinable. For instance, knowledge was only apparently evaluated in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mansfield" TYPE="STUDY">Mansfield</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>). Neither study used validated methods to test that knowledge, and data were only available for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>). For this reason, we did not attempt to perform a meta-analysis of knowledge as an outcome. Similarly, data on caregiver knowledge were only available for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>). Resource or service usage were reported in several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Edinburgh" TYPE="STUDY">Edinburgh</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liverpool" TYPE="STUDY">Liverpool</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melbourne-_x0028_SHIPS_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Melbourne (SHIPS)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philadelphia-_x0028_STAIR_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Philadelphia (STAIR)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>). Data were only available for two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>). Due to variations in service provision, and differences in the available data, it was felt to be too difficult to combine and dichotomise these data. For this reason, we did not perform a meta-analysis of service usage.</P>
<P>After receipt of data, it became apparent that analysis of mental health under one single heading was potentially inaccurate where some general measures of mental health (such as GHQ 28) were being combined with more specific measures of depression (such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-Depression scale) or anxiety (HADS-Anxiety scale). In addition, since it was apparent that some studies had used the HADS-Anxiety scale, we felt it was of potential additional value to split mental health outcomes into depression and anxiety in addition to analysis under a generic mental health domain. We considered it plausible that the intervention might reduce anxiety without necessarily reducing depression. We made this decision post hoc, and therefore we have presented the results with that caution alongside generic mental health results as originally planned.</P>

There was no significant heterogeneity seen between the two remaining subgroups (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P = 0.47). Few outcome measures for dependency were used, providing only limited outcome data for dependency (four trials, 1468 participants). In contrast a larger number of studies (13 interventions, 2817 participants) used the Barthel measure. We therefore decided to dichotomise the Barthel measure as an outcome for dependency. We discussed the potential 'cut-point' for dependency with trialists and set it at 19/20 (i.e. dependent in one or more activities of daily living). We made this decision prior to analysis of the data without prior knowledge of the results. Analysis using this outcome for dependency yielded greater participant involvement across a greater range of studies. For this reason, we conducted subsequent analyses for the outcome of dependency using this definition of dependency. Overall, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups for a reduction in dependence (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05, P = 0.16).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>In order to find out which aspects of the stroke liaison worker intervention might be effective and which might not, we attempted to form meaningful intervention subgroups. This subgrouping was based on external or pragmatic factors rather than on a known mechanism of effect for the intervention. Because individual trials were conflicting, it could not be clearly established which aspects of the intervention might be resulting in a positive benefit and which might result in harm. These subgroups were agreed by the trialists at the meeting. They are presented here with their rationale and results. Satisfaction data are presented for subgrouping according to intervention type rather than for patient characteristics.</P>
<P>Prior to the meeting of trialists, we attempted to form a classification based on the dominant emphasis of an intervention (education and information provision, social support, liaison). We chose this method of subgroup analysis recognising that although the interventions may have had a multifaceted approach, they may have been created with a primary concern in mind (for example, counselling for psychological difficulties post stroke). In order to acquire more detailed information about the types of intervention, we asked trialists to complete a 'grid' detailing different aspects of the stroke liaison workers' role and function. We then allocated trials to a subgroup (education and information provision, social support, liaison) according to the dominant emphasis of a particular trial. Where trialists could not be contacted, PL and GE completed trial grids independently.</P>

Similarly the group providing liaison as the dominant emphasis (one intervention) suggested a trend towards benefit in the treatment group (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.04, P = 0.09). There was no benefit seen for the larger subgroup (11 interventions) whose dominant emphasis was on social support (SMD 0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08, P = 0.94). Overall, there was significant subgroup heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P = 0.02) suggesting that the contrast between education and information provision and the other aspects of the stroke liaison role reflected a real difference in the intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Profession of stroke liaison worker</HEADING>
<P>The term 'stroke liaison worker' describes a role that spans different professions including nursing, psychology, social work, other allied health professions or the voluntary sector. It could be argued that differing levels of knowledge and skill rather than attitude alone may differentiate between otherwise externally comparable roles. This knowledge or skill may influence patient education and information provision, or provide more focused patient and carer counselling. For this reason dividing the results by professional grouping seems a legitimate method of analysing the overall results.</P>
<P>We asked trialists to provide information on the professional background of the stroke liaison worker evaluated in each trial where this was not clear from published data. We grouped the professions into four distinct subgroups: nurse, psychologist, social worker and a final grouping of generic health care worker or volunteer. This last subgroup included trials where the stroke liaison worker was from an allied health profession, the voluntary sector or (in the case of some trials with more than one worker) no specific background but had been trained in the stroke liaison worker role.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Presence of a carer</HEADING>
<P>It is theoretically possible that patients without identified carer support might be at higher risk of poorer health. It therefore follows that this subgroup might benefit the most from social support aspects of the intervention. Within the trials there was varied involvement of carers. Some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhode-Island" TYPE="STUDY">Rhode Island</LINK>) specifically recruited only patients who had an identified primary caregiver. Other studies did not include or record caregiver involvement at all (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow</LINK>). Clearly these trials do not allow us to test the hypothesis that the presence or absence of an identified primary caregiver results in different responses to the stroke liaison worker intervention. For this reason, we excluded these trials from this subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>The quality of recording of caregiver presence and proximity of involvement with the patient was variable. Two trials reported carer relationship (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>). Other trials did not collect these data. To analyse these trials adequately, we hypothesised that the presence of carer data recorded by trialists formed a proxy for the clear identification of a caregiver. This proxy has its limitations, as the proximity and level of involvement of a caregiver with a patient may vary considerably and not be sensitively measured by this dichotomisation. Nevertheless, it could be postulated that a closely involved carer is more likely to be contactable and therefore available for simple data collection. We therefore dichotomised data according to whether a carer was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>) or whether carer outcome data were collected. Results are presented here for these two subgroups. Clearly there can be no comparison of carer outcomes for this subgroup analysis. We observed no significant subgroup or subgroup interaction.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient functional status</HEADING>
<P>It has been assumed in most trials that the intervention of a stroke liaison worker should be applied to all patients regardless of their level of disability or functional dependence. Data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bradford" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford</LINK>) have previously suggested that patients with mild to moderate disability (as measured by the Barthel Index 15 to 19) make the most gains from stroke liaison worker input. We therefore decided to evaluate this question by functional status according to Barthel measurement. Patients were divided according to their Barthel index at recruitment (which usually equated to their Barthel at discharge from hospital). They were divided into three subgroups: Barthel 20 (independent), Barthel 15 to 19 (mild to moderately dependent) and Barthel less than 15 (dependent). Barthel indices at recruitment varied across the trials as might be expected and are illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. Recruitment appeared highest in the more independent groups as might be expected for a trial evaluating psychosocial interventions in a population returning to the community. Interestingly the patient population appears to trichotomise relatively equally. Where a significant subgroup effect was seen in conjunction with a significant subgroup interaction, the results are discussed here.</P>

This effect size would equate to 10 fewer dependent patients (95% CI 17 fewer to four fewer) for every 100 patients with mild to moderate disability that were seen by the stroke liaison worker. Significant subgroup heterogeneity existed suggesting that this subgroup was responding differently to the intervention than the others (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P &lt; 0.05). The other subgroups did not show a significant effect of the stroke liaison worker intervention however (Barthel less than 15 OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.62, P = 0.43; Barthel 20 OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.42, P = 0.92).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Death or dependence</HEADING>
<P>We decided after analysis of dependence data to look at this combined outcome. The concern was that there might appear to be a reduction in dependence at the expense of increased mortality. We combined data using the same dependence data. Overall, data for this new outcome did not show a significant benefit from the stroke liaison worker for a reduction in death or dependence (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, P = 0.32). A significant subgroup effect was again seen (Barthel 15 to 19) as well as subgroup heterogeneity suggesting that this group responded differently to the stroke liaison worker input (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81, P = 0.002). This risk difference equates to 11 fewer dead or dependent patients per 100 treated cases (95% CI 17 fewer to four fewer) as a result of stroke liaison worker input for the group with mild to moderate disability. Results for the other subgroups were not significant (Barthel less than 15 OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.04, P = 0.11; Barthel 20 OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, P = 0.93; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-25 11:41:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Individual patient data meta-analysis confers considerable advantage in unpacking the potential benefits or harms of an intervention. At a statistical level it is less likely to overestimate the effect of an intervention, but also gives narrower confidence intervals, reducing the chance of missing a real benefit or harm. It permits a greater understanding of the studies involved, which is vital where the interventions and trials are complex, as in this case. Additionally, they allow greater flexibility in exploring subgroups. This is important in this case as little is understood regarding the underlying mechanism of potential benefit for stroke liaison workers and therefore it is hard to identify which intervention characteristics are most important and additionally which patient subgroups, if any, are most likely to benefit. However, individual patient data meta-analysis is considerably more complex. Meta-analysis is secondary analysis of research where ethics approval has already been obtained. Despite that, however, some trialists did run into difficulties in sharing their data. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boston" TYPE="STUDY">Boston</LINK>) described having to have permission to share their data with a third party. In one case (<LINK REF="STD-Adelaide" TYPE="STUDY">Adelaide</LINK>) the ethics committee would not give permission to share anonymised individual patient data with the collaborative group. Instead, data for subgroup analysis were provided in aggregate form on request from the lead author. In the other case (<LINK REF="STD-Boston" TYPE="STUDY">Boston</LINK>), approval from the data review board took approximately one year and represented a considerable delay for the review process.</P>
<P>It is important to state that in the planning of this analysis, the lack of a theoretical or pathophysiological rationale for stroke liaison workers affected the selection of appropriate primary outcome measures. Given that this is a broad or comprehensive intervention for a wide range of problems, it was unclear from the published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bradford" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edinburgh" TYPE="STUDY">Edinburgh</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>) which outcome might be expected to be impacted most. As a result, the published trials evaluated different primary outcome measures from activities of daily living (<LINK REF="STD-Boston" TYPE="STUDY">Boston</LINK>), satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-London" TYPE="STUDY">London</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrecht" TYPE="STUDY">Utrecht</LINK>), subjective health status (<LINK REF="STD-Oxford" TYPE="STUDY">Oxford</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preston" TYPE="STUDY">Preston</LINK>) and extended activities of daily living (<LINK REF="STD-Bradford" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford</LINK>) or none at all (<LINK REF="STD-Edinburgh" TYPE="STUDY">Edinburgh</LINK>). For this reason, two primary outcome measures were chosen, as it was argued that if the stroke liaison workers' aim was to return patients to normal roles that this might be measured in activities and perceived health. It remains a relevant potential criticism that we chose the wrong outcome measure to evaluate effectiveness and that stroke liaison workers might have an unanticipated impact in an entirely different domain. The intervention of a stroke liaison worker did not affect the primary outcomes of subjective health status or extended activities of daily living. The implication is that patients who were seen by the stroke liaison worker did not feel their health or quality of life to be better than controls, and they were not more independent. There are two potential explanations for failing to demonstrate an impact. The first concerns the intervention itself. The second concerns matters of methodology.</P>
<P>The criticism of the intervention might appropriately be that it is poorly focused and too broad or diffuse to impact a single, specific outcome. Because these interventions were developed on a practical and intuitive basis, as has already been said, they lack a clear underlying mechanism of action. This development of services to meet a wide range of problems post stroke may have been too ambitious and as a consequence poorly focused. The provision of information and education is a real need with a wider evidence base than in this review alone (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2001</LINK>). The impact of information might reasonably be expected to be measured in satisfaction first, rather than in behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Education-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Education Group 1999</LINK>). Liaison as a service offered for patients may be difficult to measure and is perhaps poorly addressed in the stroke liaison worker trials. It might be reasonable to expect that liaison between the patient and community services or health services might be measured in resource use. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess resource use in this review due to a lack of standardised measures. In addition, the meaning of increased resource use must be evaluated. It is unclear whether increased uptake of community services for instance means increased access and enhanced resources, or conversely an increasing dependence. Similarly, in a health care context it would be difficult to tell from crude data whether increased use of medical and therapy resources meant an attitude of active and self-motivated health care or simply increasing ill health. Social support, whilst being potentially hardest to define, may in fact be the one outcome that has the most measures of effectiveness. Many of these outcomes are surrogates (e.g. measures of mental health, self-efficacy, satisfaction, participation) and poorly correlated with what is a diffuse and poorly defined entity. Some trials have tried to be more specific about social support and have included counselling as part of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Boston" TYPE="STUDY">Boston</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philadelphia-_x0028_STAIR_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Philadelphia (STAIR)</LINK>). Whilst it might be expected that this would more directly impact some measures (e.g. depression, anxiety, etc.) it has not been so clear in either the trials or the review process.</P>
<P>It has been assumed that all patients have information needs and share many of the psychological and social problems post stroke. Similarly, it has been assumed that the intervention should be targeted at all patients regardless of age, sex or stroke severity. This assumption does not adequately take into consideration differences in risk between patients in terms of, for example, the onset of post-stroke depression, social isolation, anxiety, etc. Patient subgroup analysis was only possible for those identifiers that allow division of patients into groups (e.g. age, sex, Barthel at recruitment, etc.). These patient descriptors may not adequately correlate with the risks of a poor outcome (e.g. age and depression) and therefore may not subdivide patient subgroups according to meaningful groups. Despite these shortfalls, and because of the existing limitations with the data, the subgroup analysis by age, sex, Barthel and the presence of a carer seems a robust and plausible exploration of the data. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Melbourne" TYPE="STUDY">Melbourne</LINK>) recruited patients more than six months after stroke. Data for this study were only obtained from published data for limited numbers of outcomes. For this reason subgroup analysis for this description was felt to be unhelpful. Subgroup analysis within the review process highlights some interesting areas of differences that may be important and may identify important aspects of either the intervention or the target population. It is recognised in observational studies and trials that multiple analyses carry the risk of false positive results. This risk should be lessened in meta-analysis, nevertheless it still remains a risk with multiple subgroup analyses. For this reason we have only considered subgroup results where there is both a subgroup with a significant difference and a significant subgroup interaction.</P>
<P>Analysis of the intervention effect by emphasis of the intervention highlights some differences between the intervention types that may be important. In the analysis of subjective health status, for instance, two subgroups (education and information provision as well as liaison) were significant in favour of the intervention, whilst one subgroup (social support) was non-significant. Importantly, the subgroups varied in size, with the education and information provision subgroup containing two studies, and the liaison group containing only one. The social support group contained 10 interventions from eight trials. The differences between the groups could be potentially accounted for by 'regression to the mean' where the larger subgroup has more neutral results. Heterogeneity tests were positive, suggesting that a subgroup interaction exists and that the subgroups are behaving differently for this outcome. There is a risk of over interpreting subgroup data and, given the overall non-significant result for stroke liaison workers, we cannot necessarily conclude that any one subgroup is effective. Despite this it is possible to conclude that interventions with a strong emphasis on social support are less effective at impacting subjective health status. Analysis of the same data by the profession of the stroke liaison worker reveals a few interesting findings. Patients whose stroke liaison worker was a nurse by professional background appear to have a significant reduction in depression score when compared to controls. This effect also differed significantly from the other subgroups suggesting that the intervention, when delivered by a nurse, differed in nature from interventions delivered by other professions.</P>
<P>If the intervention itself does not appear to be effective for all patients, it is reasonable to explore patient subgroups to establish which groups of patients, if any, benefit, and which do not. Analysis by age suggested differences between the two subgroups in how they responded to the stroke liaison worker in the area of activities of daily living (ADL). Younger patients appeared to benefit in improvement in ADL score in the group reviewed by the stroke liaison worker. In addition, heterogeneity tests were positive suggesting that the younger (less than 65 years) and older (65 years or older) patients respond differently to the intervention of a stroke liaison worker. It is not possible to say whether these differences relate to differences in the way the stroke liaison workers treated patients who were younger, or more probably because there are important differences in the patient group examined. Analysis of data by the presence or absence of a carer could be criticised for our choice of a surrogate for carer involvement. The absence of data for a primary carer does not mean the absence of a good caregiving network. This may be a reason that no significant differences were found between the two subgroups. Equally, the impact of a stroke liaison worker's social support on the effects of social isolation may be small. Arguably, several short visits from a stroke liaison worker may not be enough to mitigate against the risks of social isolation, depression and mortality that appear to be associated with reduced social support.</P>
<P>The final patient subgrouping is the functional status of the patient at recruitment. This subgrouping was suggested by one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bradford" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford</LINK>) as identifying patients who would benefit most. This trial had suggested that patients with mild-moderate dependence (Barthel 15 to 19) benefited most. For this reason, we have used the same definitions of dependence. It is plausible that patients with severe dependence may make minimal gains with information provision. Similarly, patients who are dependent may already have established connections with services (such as carers, social work, primary care, etc.) and may have little to gain from liaison input. Alternatively, you might expect that caregivers of patients who are dependent would need the most support and might be the most satisfied. By contrast, independent patients might be expected to have the least risk of depression or morbidity, and the least to gain from social support or liaison. The finding of a reduction in dependence (or an increase in the number who were independent in activities of daily living) was in some respects surprising. The intervention was primarily a psychosocial one and was not expected to impact physical outcomes. As has already been said, there was concern that the reduction in dependence could be at the expense of an increase in mortality. For this reason we considered a post hoc analysis of a combined outcome of death or dependency necessary in order to rule out this concern. This result was also considered surprising. The effect size of this reduction in death or dependence is considerable, equating to 11 fewer dead or dependent patients for every 100 patients treated. The mechanism of this effect is not clear. It is interesting to note that the review of early supported discharge after stroke also found that patients with mild to moderate disability (Barthel 10 to 20) made the most gains with early supported discharge, resulting in reductions in death or disability (<LINK REF="REF-ESDT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESDT 2005</LINK>). It is interesting to postulate whether the improvement seen in this group reflects the impact of the stroke liaison worker per se (as opposed to any other form of rehabilitation intervention) or whether it reflects the sensitivity of this particular patient group to rehabilitation and to potential gains in independence. None of the studies in the stroke liaison worker review appears to have had input from an early supported discharge service. There may be potential benefit from further research exploring the rehabilitation potential of this patient subgroup and the most appropriate design of rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<P>Data for the outcome of satisfaction appear to provide the only overall statistically significant results for the intervention. Patients responded significantly to only one question: 'someone has really listened'. This response would potentially fit well with the social support intentions of the intervention. It is interesting to note, however, that there are a number of patient responses that show a trend towards significance in favour of the control group ('I have been treated with kindness and respect', 'I was able to talk to the staff about any problems I had' and 'I am satisfied with outpatient services'). There may be more than one explanation for these findings (although in the absence of statistical significance we must be cautious about drawing conclusions). One possible explanation is that in simple terms patients were as satisfied with the intervention as those who did not receive it. One additional potential explanation reflects the complexity of using satisfaction as an outcome measure. Satisfaction, it might be argued, is based in part on a participant's expectations. If expectations are low, participants may express high satisfaction with what is delivered. If expectations are raised, for example by a stroke liaison worker educating patients on the importance of treatment and investigation, it might be expected that patients become less satisfied with service provision (e.g. outpatient services). In addition, it is recognised that satisfaction questionnaires have a ceiling effect and that they may not be sensitive to discriminate between groups if overall satisfaction is high.</P>
<P>Interestingly, carers appear to express satisfaction more frequently than patients. The responses that reach significance appear to be related to the nature of the intervention and are therefore plausible. For example the response 'I have received enough information about recovery and rehabilitation' and the response 'I have received all the information I needed about the causes of the patient's illness' would plausibly fit with the education and information provision aspects of the intervention. Similarly, the response 'someone has really listened' would fit with the social support aspects of the intervention and the response 'I have not felt neglected' would fit with the liaison aspects of the service. In some cases, however, the positive results are drawn from only two studies studying approximately 300 carers. The results, although statistically significant, are not robust and the addition of as few as 10 positive responses to the control group could result in a change to a non-significant result ('someone has really listened').</P>

<P>There is little evidence from this meta-analysis to support stroke liaison workers for all groups of patients and carers. There appears to be significant benefit from stroke liaison worker input to patients with mild to moderate disability (e.g. Barthel 15 to 19) and it seems reasonable to ensure that services do not neglect this group. Patients and carers do report improved satisfaction with aspects of service provision. Healthcare providers need to evaluate the value of this outcome.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-25 11:41:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Research into this multifaceted intervention must be re-evaluated. Research should consider evaluating more closely the relationship between more focused interventions for specific impairments (e.g. counselling for depression) and their wider impact on participation (e.g. extended activities of daily living). Multifaceted interventions with broad intentions also need to be linked more closely to evidenced therapeutic methods. Further work on the model of interventions for psychosocial problems is warranted. In addition, it must be noted that most trials were conducted in well-developed healthcare settings with established stroke services. Extrapolation cannot be made to all settings or healthcare organisations.</P>
<P>The impact of stroke liaison worker interventions on patients with mild to moderate disability needs to be explored. Further work should concentrate on establishing if this is a real effect of the intervention or simply reflects the ability of patients with mild to moderate disability to improve with continued healthcare input. The implications are significant. Potential overlap exists with the well-documented effects of early supported discharge after stroke. No such services existed in the trials evaluated in this review.</P>
