<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Non-malignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries. Fibromyalgia syndrome is an increasingly recognised chronic musculoskeletal disorder. The main purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and wide spread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. Patients included in the controlled trials in this review ranged in age from 18-65 years. Seven studies, with 1050 patients were included. The effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation was graded limited, showing no quantifiable benefit for both fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Non-malignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries. Fibromyalgia syndrome is an increasing recognised chronic musculoskeletal disorder.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>An electronic search was conducted and included MEDLINE from 1966, PsycLIT from 1967 and EMBASE from 1980 to April 1998. The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register was searched as well as, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). The references of identified articles and reviews were checked, studies published in the Finnish medical database Medic from 1978 to 1998 screened and the Science Citation Index searched. Content experts were also contacted for additional or unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>From all references found in our original search, we selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients suffering from fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary; that is, it had to consist of a physician's consultation, plus a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of both.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Four reviewers independently selected the RCTs and CCTs that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies to actual clinical use. Two other reviewers extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only seven relevant studies (1050 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. None of these were considered, methodologically, a high quality randomized controlled trial. Four of the included RCTs on fibromyalgia were graded low quality and suggest no quantifiable benefits. The three included RCTs on widespread musculoskeletal pain showed that based on limited evidence, overall, no evidence of efficacy was observed. However, behavioral treatment and stress management appear to be important components. Education combined with physical training showed some positive effects in long term follow up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these musculoskeletal disorders. However, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic musculoskeletal disorders, which cause much personal suffering and substantial economic loss to the society. There is a need for high quality trials in this field.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:19:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Nonmalignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Heli_x00f6_vaara-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heliövaara 1993</LINK>). Fibromyalgia syndrome is an increasingly recognized chronic musculoskeletal disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Simms-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simms 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Many pharmacological, physical and other therapies (such as assistive devices, hypnosis, relaxation, stress management, therapeutic massage or hydrotherapy), have been widely used, although scientific evidence of their effectiveness is still lacking. The benefits of these treatments are often temporary. Prolonged pain tends to develop into a combination of physical, psychological and social disabilities. For that reason the physical rehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders has been combined with psychological, behavioral and educational interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Allegrante-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allegrante 1996</LINK>). The conceptual basis for this kind of rehabilitation lies on the bio-psycho-social model of illness. The multidisciplinary treatment is practiced in pain clinics or rehabilitation centers, which have rapidly increased in numbers over the last decades (<LINK REF="REF-Flor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1992</LINK>). Today, the bio-psycho-social model is also applied in outpatient rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Multidisciplinary treatment programs require substantial staff and financial resources from the heath care system. The indirect costs burden the employers, insurance companies and patients. The value of the multidisciplinary treatment has often been questioned because of the lack of data on its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Two meta-analyses on the effectiveness of multidisciplinary pain treatment have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Flor-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cutler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 1994</LINK>), but both lack information of the most recent trials. </P>
<P>This review is series of four systematic reviews, on effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on common musculoskeletal disorders among working age adults.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. We investigated the following parameters: pain, global improvement, disorder specific functional status, generic functional status, ability to work, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and satisfaction with treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:19:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) on multidisciplinary rehabilitation were considered. Studies reported in English, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, German, French or Spanish were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Originally, RCTs assessing the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients suffering from fibromyalgia, widespread musculoskeletal pain, subacute low back pain, neck and shoulder pain, repetitive strain injuries and headache were included. Only studies dealing with fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain are included in this particular Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Patients in these trials were required to be working age adults (18-65 years) and not to have had acute trauma, neoplasms, inflammatory or neurologic diseases. Studies dealing with postoperative pain and with osteoporosis were excluded, the latter because the association of osteoporosis with pain is uncertain, except following fractures. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary; that is, it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these. Thus, RCTs in which rehabilitation was exclusively or predominantly medical were excluded. For example, a program consisting solely of medical treatment and physiotherapy was not included.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We looked for the following types of outcomes in the selected studies:</P>
<P>1. Pain intensity (e.g., visual analogue scale, ordinal scale)<BR/>2. Global status (e.g., overall improvement)<BR/>3. Disorder specific functional status <BR/>4. Generic functional status or quality of life (e.g., SF36, 15-D, Sickness Impact Profile, Health Assessment Questionnaire)<BR/>5. Ability to work (e.g., sickness absence, return to work, number of days off work)<BR/>6. Health care consumption and costs (e.g., physician's consultations, psychologist's or social worker's consultations, physiotherapy, intake of analgesics)<BR/>7. Satisfaction with treatment</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:19:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE from 1966 for relevant studies, PsycLIT from 1967 and EMBASE from 1988 to April 1998. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group trials register were also searched for recent studies. The references of identified articles and reviews were checked. In addition, we screened studies published in Finland from 1978 to 1998 using the Finnish medical database Medic, and performed a Science Citation Index search. We also consulted 24 experts in the field of rehabilitation to identify potentially relevant studies we might have missed.</P>
<P>The Medline search strategy used is outlined in Appendix 1, and was modified for the other database searches.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The methods for the systematic review are based on current recommendations (University of York 1996, <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). The clinical relevance of the trials was assessed using a set of criteria based on the recommendations for critical reading of clinical literature by <LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1994</LINK>. </P>
<P>Study selection :</P>
<P>Four reviewers (KK, AM, RR, HH) independently selected the trials for the systematic review. Each of the four reviewers selected the studies from among half of the papers so that the assessments of each reviewer overlapped with other's assessments. The reviewers were blinded to the journal and study authors. From the title, keywords and abstract they assessed if the study met the inclusion criteria regarding design, subjects and intervention. Disagreements were discussed in consensus meetings, and if these were unresolved or if it was unclear whether the article should be included, the full article was retrieved for final assessment. The same reviewers, still blinded to authors and journal, then assessed the full text article to make the final decision whether the study met the inclusion criteria. The disagreements were again discussed in a consensus meeting. </P>
<P>Data extraction:</P>
<P>Two reviewers (MvT, BK) independently extracted the data (using a standardized form) and remained blinded to authors, journal and institution or origin. The following types of outcomes were considered: pain, global improvement, functional status (disorder specific and generic), ability to work, health care consumption and costs, and satisfaction with treatment. We considered a study to have a positive outcome if multidisciplinary rehabilitation showed improvement in at least one of these outcome measures, and negative if the multidisciplinary was less effective than the reference intervention(s). A study was considered neutral if multidisciplinary intervention was considered ineffective compared to the reference interventions.</P>
<P>Clinical relevance assessment:</P>
<P>Two experts in the field of rehabilitation (AM, HH) then assessed the clinical relevance of the extracted studies by evaluating whether the patients, health care setting and interventions were described precisely enough to allow inferences about the clinical applicability of the results and the clinical relevance of the measured outcome. On this basis they decided whether the evidence was sufficient for clinical recommendations to be made on the indication in question. </P>
<P>Three questions were used to assess the clinical relevance:</P>
<P>1. Are the patient characteristics and treatment settings described well enough to decide whether they are comparable to those you see in your own practice? </P>
<P>2. Are all the intervention(s) described well enough to allow you to provide the same to your own patients? </P>
<P>3. Were clinically relevant outcomes measured?</P>
<P>Methodological quality assessment:</P>
<P>The two reviewers (MvT, BK) who extracted the data independently also assessed the methodological quality of the trials. A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements. </P>
<P>We used a criteria list of <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1998</LINK>, where in only items reflecting the internal quality were used and equal weights were applied to the criteria. Each of following criterion was scored as positive, negative or unclear (if the information was not available in an article).</P>
<P>Method of randomization was scored positive if a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence was used. Examples of adequate concealment procedures were some form of centralized randomization scheme, numbered or coded containers, an on-site computer system providing allocations in a locked, unreadable file that could be assessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant, and in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque and envelopes. Clearly inadequate were procedures such as alternation, or reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week or any such other approach. If the concealment of treatment allocation was described only as random or randomized it was considered as unclear.</P>
<P>Concealment of treatment allocation was scored positive if an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients generated the assignment.</P>
<P>Blinding of patients and therapists were scored positive if they were blinded regarding treatment allocation and the method of blinding was appropriate. If blinding of patients or therapists was not feasible or if the trial was pragmatic, the credibility of the treatment modalities (interventions) should have been evaluated and the treatment modalities should have been equally credible and acceptable to patients and therapists.</P>
<P>Blinding of observers was scored positive if the observers were blinded regarding treatment allocation and the blinding was adequate. It was scored negative if only self-reported (questionnaire) outcomes were used.</P>
<P>Similarity of baseline characteristics was scored positive if according to the reviewers the study groups were comparable at baseline. </P>
<P>Co-interventions avoided or equal was scored positive if co-interventions were avoided in the design of the study or were equally divided among the intervention groups.</P>
<P>Compliance was scored positive if according to the reviewer compliance was measured and satisfactory in all study groups.</P>
<P>Withdrawal rate was scored positive, if greater than 80% of the patients were assessed at the main moment of effect measurement.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis was scored positive if all patients were included in the analysis as part of the intervention group allocated by randomization, irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions. If loss to follow-up was substantial (20% or more), an intention-to-treat analysis as well as an alternative analysis, which accounts for missing values (e.g., a worst-case analysis), should have been performed.</P>
<P>Maximum score was 10. An RCT was considered to be of high methodological quality if at least five out of ten items were scored positive and of low methodological quality if less than five items were scored positive and the study had no fatal flaws. Any fatal flaws in the study design or execution meant that the study was considered inadequate and was excluded from the analysis. Examples of fatal flaws are, withdrawals by more than 40 percent of patients, total or nearly total non-adherence to the protocol, or very poor, non-adjusted comparability in the base-line criteria.</P>
<P>Qualitative analysis:</P>
<P>Qualitative analysis involved using a rating system below, with four levels of scientific evidence for effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on each diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). Because of the heterogeneity of the studies with regard to populations, interventions and outcome measures, we refrained from statistical pooling. Results were considered contradictory if the overall conclusions regarding effectiveness in different studies on the same indication were contradictory or inconsistent.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Thirty eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen lacked a biomedical component in the rehabilitation scheme. Two had major flaws and one CCT was excluded because of an a priori decision to include only RCTs if there were three or more available. The age variation in most of the studies was considerable, but fell within the range of our inclusion criteria. The seven included studies were very heterogeneous with regard to populations, interventions and follow-up periods. There was notable variation in documented outcomes, too. Pain intensity was assessed in all except one study, ability to work or return to work in only one study, disorder specific functional status and generic functional status in each of two trials. Five out of seven trials had been published after 1990 (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four randomized controlled trials on fibromyalgia were assessed: <LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Burckhardt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Burckhardt 1994</LINK> (n= 99), <LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Nicassio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Nicassio 1997</LINK> (n=86), <LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Vlaeyen1996" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Vlaeyen1996</LINK> (n=131), and <LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Wigers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Wigers 1996</LINK> (n=60). Burckhart's trial only compared the effectiveness of education plus physical training with education, while Vlaeyen's trial compared education and cognitive treatment with education and group discussion. Both studies had waiting list controls. Nicassio compared behavioral therapy with education. The trial of Wigers examined the benefits of stress management over aerobic exercise and treatment as usual. In the studies of Wigers and Nicassio, the emphasis was on behavioral therapy. Three of the studies had pain intensity as a common outcome parameter, but they used different types of measurements, and the follow-up times varied. The effectiveness of stress management was neutral compared to aerobic exercise (<LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Wigers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Wigers 1996</LINK>) as was behavioral therapy compared to education alone (<LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Nicassio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Nicassio 1997</LINK>). Stress management was more effective than usual care (<LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Wigers-1996" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Wigers 1996</LINK>), and in long term follow-up education combined with physical exercise was better than education alone (<LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Burckhardt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Burckhardt 1994</LINK>). Educational cognitive intervention was as effective as educational discussional intervention but the former intervention was more expensive (<LINK REF="STD-FM_x002a_-Vlaeyen1996" TYPE="STUDY">FM* Vlaeyen1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only three trials were selected on widespread musculoskeletal pain: <LINK REF="STD-M_x002a_-Lindh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">M* Lindh 1997</LINK> (n=611), <LINK REF="STD-M_x002a_-Linton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">M* Linton 1984</LINK> (n=20), and <LINK REF="STD-M_x002a_-Moore-1985" TYPE="STUDY">M* Moore 1985</LINK> (n=43). Lindh studied the effectiveness of outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation, but the intervention in the primary care control groups was not described adequately. The trials of Linton and Moore concentrated on behavioral therapy, but had waiting list controls that we considered inadequate for chronic conditions. Lindh had return to work as the only outcome parameter, and no results based on intention to treat analysis were presented. Both Linton and Moore had pain intensity as an outcome parameter, but the follow-up times were not comparable. Multidisciplinary interventions were considered to be ineffective compared to reference intervention(s) in every study.</P>
<P>Clinical relevance of the included studies<BR/>In most of the articles on fibromyalgia the populations and interventions were described in an acceptable way and the outcome measures were relevant. In the articles dealing with widespread musculoskeletal pain the practice setting was described adequately in only one trial. None of the articles defined the study population in an acceptable way.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Our extensive literature search identified 1808 citations for appraisal against our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We retrieved 311 of these articles for further assessment and study selection. Just 38 articles were deemed to fulfil our inclusion criteria. However, 18 of these papers were later excluded, mainly due to lack of a biomedical component in the rehabilitation scheme. Two other papers had fatal flaws, and one CCT was excluded because there were already three RCTs on fibromyalgia included. Seven (1050 patients) of the included papers assessed fibromyalgia or widespread musculoskeletal pain. </P>
<P>The level of the research-based scientific evidence regarding effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain was graded as limited (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>As interventions and outcomes did not coincide in the four included low-quality RCTs on fibromyalgia, the limited evidence available suggests that there is no quantifiable benefit of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia. However, behavioral treatment and stress management appear to be important components of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Education combined with physical training produced some positive effects in long-term follow-up. </P>
<P>Based on three methodologically low-quality and inconsistent RCTs on widespread musculoskeletal pain, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was graded as ineffective, based on limited evidence.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is difficult to define, and it seems to be understood in different ways in different societies. In order to get a precise idea of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, we required each intervention to be executed by a professional of that discipline, for example, the vocational treatment by an occupational therapist, the behavioral treatment by a psychologist and the social counseling by a social worker. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult to classify an intervention as biomedical, psychological, social or vocational.</P>
<P>In several studies the role of the physician as a representative of the biomedical component of multidisciplinary rehabilitation was unclear, because it was not explicitly stated whether the patients were recruited from physicians' offices or directly from some other sources, such as patient associations. </P>
<P>EMG-biofeedback as a psychological treatment is regarded as controversial. For this review we excluded studies where EMG-biofeedback was the only component of psychological rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Behavioral treatments are widely used for musculoskeletal disorders and several studies have assessed their effectiveness within the psychological intervention. Some rehabilitation programs comprised a behavioral component and we included these studies because the behavioral approach is a fundamental feature of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders.<BR/> <BR/>The validity of the review:</P>
<P>The most difficult part in conducting a systematic review is finding the relevant papers. Our aim was to cover the area of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for various musculoskeletal disorders as comprehensively as possible, which was crucial for the validity of the review. Although we separated this review later from a broader review, it is likely that we found more relevant papers on fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain for this review than we would have found with a more specific search strategy.</P>
<P>After piloting the search strategy, a long and complicated strategy resulted, which, we believe, found most of the existing relevant papers. We searched six different databases using our search profile, which was based on the UK Cochrane Centre search strategy, and is highly sensitive for the identification of RCTs in EMBASE and MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>). We also screened the references of all obtained reviews and all included papers, and performed a Science Citation Index forward search. Most of the papers were obtained through the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT and the Cochrane library. Reference checking, citation tracking and consultation of experts proved to be of little additional value (but required considerable effort), which probably indicates the comprehensiveness of the prior search. As the CCTR covered the same area as the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches, it might be prioritised in the future. The CCTR includes RCTs from MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, but also from a worldwide hand screening of biomedical journals.</P>
<P>The study selection was performed by two independent reviewers and primarily based on abstracts. To ensure that every relevant study was selected, the full article was retrieved for further assessment if there was any doubt about the study fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Retrieving all articles would have been extremely time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the electronic database search found many irrelevant articles to us, such as case-reports and letters.</P>
<P>To avoid bias, we blinded the reviewers to authors, institute of origin, journal and acknowledgements during the study selection, the data extraction, and the methodological and clinical quality assessment. At least two reviewers selected the papers, while two others extracted the data, and at each stage consensus meetings were arranged to resolve any disagreements. At the study selection stage, blinding demanded much work, but may have reduced selection bias. At the data extraction and clinical relevance assessment stages, blinding played less important role because there were few included trials and the reviewers beforehand knew many of them.</P>
<P>When assessing the internal validity, i.e. the methodological quality, of the individual studies we included the items considered the most important in previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Koes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 1991</LINK>). We did not quantify the importance of each validity item, as these weights can be considered arbitrary.</P>
<P>Clinical relevance of the included studies:</P>
<P>All reviewed studies were intervention studies and intended to be applicable in clinical practice. Assessment of the applicability of the results demands that patient characteristics and interventions are described precisely enough for clear inferences to be made about which patients may be treated, where and how they are treated. As well, pertinent outcome measurements are important for the clinical relevance. </P>
<P>We also set out to assess the clinical relevance of the results; that is information that we consider useful for clinicians. However, the assessment of the clinical relevance of the results proved an impossible task. There was wide variation in the precision by which the patients, settings and interventions were described, and because judgment of clinical relevance of the results is subjective, and dependent, on patient population, intervention and follow-up times of each outcome. There also tended to be a deficiency of clinically relevant information mainly in studies assessing less specific indications, such as repetitive strain injury or widespread musculoskeletal pain. </P>
<P>Methodological quality of the studies:</P>
<P>In general, the methodological quality of the seven trials on various multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults appeared to be low.</P>
<P>All trials were randomized, but none was deemed to be a methodologically high-quality RCT. One of the main methodological problems was how the method of randomization was described. There was an adequately reported method of randomization in only one study, but it was performed in a inadequate way. Other methodological defects included blinding of the therapist (none of the trials), and blinding of the patients (two trials). Intention to treat analysis is an essential feature of an RCT, but was used in only two of the seven studies. Blinding of patients and therapists in RCTs on rehabilitation is usually not possible, but a feasible alternative may be to evaluate expectations for the rehabilitation response in the intervention and control groups in advance among both patients and therapists. </P>
<P>The information reported in the articles was insufficient for scoring in 24 out of 70 (34%) methodological quality items, according to the criteria used. The quality of reporting of RCTs may hopefully improve in the future, now that many journals have accepted the CONSORT-statement on enhancing the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials (Begg 1998)</P>
<P>Level of the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions:</P>
<P>In this review, our aim was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the treatment of fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal pain. We found limited research-based evidence favouring multidisciplinary rehabilitation in fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain. However, the patient populations, interventions, outcomes and follow-up times varied, making even a qualitative analysis difficult. </P>
<P>Methods for structured systematic reviews are constantly evolving. Using different methods for grading the evidence would lead to different conclusions. We originally planned to use a modified version of the rating system used in US Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Low Back Problems in Adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bigos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigos 1994</LINK>). As the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group for Spinal Disorders published method guidelines for systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>) at the time we started to conduct our review we decided to use these recommendations.</P>
<P>Drawing clinical conclusions about the magnitude and duration of the effectiveness of interventions for these diagnosis was hampered by the lack of high-quality studies, deficiencies in documentation of patient characteristics and interventions, and weak statistical power of most of the studies. Taking everything into account, we feel that there is insufficient evidence for clinical recommendations to be made.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Despite an extensive search we were able to select only seven relevant trials to include in this systematic review of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia, and widespread musculoskeletal pain, among working age adults. The methodological quality of the selected studies was low. The level of scientific evidence regarding multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these diagnosis is limited. Evidence for clinical recommendations was insufficient.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>According to the experience of many patients and professionals in the field of rehabilitation, currently used multidisciplinary interventions are beneficial in relieving the physical and psychological disability inherent in musculoskeletal disorders. These common disorders cause much suffering and economic loss. To justify the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, good quality clinical trials that tackle questions concerning the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of rehabilitation are clearly indicated.</P>

<P>Comment Karjalainen K et al. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal pain in working age adults <BR/>Cite this comment as http://www.update-software.com/ccng/ccng.exe?SourceID=CD001984#Content174 <BR/>Sender Chris Hyde <BR/>Sender Description <BR/>Sender Email <BR/>Sender Address <BR/>Date Received 14/07/00 </P>
<P>While preparing an abstract on this review for the journal Evidence-based Health Care, I noted a few issues which may help develop the review further.</P>
<P>1. I had real difficulty keeping track of the studies included and excluded. You provisionally included 38; but only seven were included and a further seven were listed as excluded. Where are the other 24?</P>
<P>2. I had great difficulty seeing what the results were for the various different outcomes measured in the seven included trials. The information is buried in the characteristics of included studies table. I really need to be able to see at a glance what the overall pattern of pre-post changes was in treatment and control in each study.</P>
<P>3. Concerning quality assessment, the tables 3 &amp; 4 need a foot-note indicating your criteria (as listed in the text of the review) - otherwise you have to go back and forth to remember exactly what 2,3 etc mean.</P>
<P>4. Further on quality assessment, you might consider whether using pre-post changes as outcome measures offers some protection against confounding when randomisation has not been performed perfectly.</P>
<P>5. Finally you might consider whether you have clearly demonstrated the case for further research. There are trials and you say yourselves that they are not fatally flawed (although of poor quality). You really need show clearly what the existing studies show (you skip over this at present) and explain how the low quality could lead to a false impression of effectiveness. I'm afraid I don't find the argument about levels of evidence terribly convincing.</P>
<P>Hope these comments help.</P>
<P>Best wishes. Chris Hyde.</P>
