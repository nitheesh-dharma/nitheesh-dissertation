<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-07-11 17:29:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Pain and gut paralysis (movement failure) commonly occur after abdominal surgery. Following laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy, approximately 10.3% of patients will have temporary gut paralysis. This may prolong length of hospital stay and may increase costs of the procedure. Among the possible ways to treat pain after abdominal surgery are an epidural and injections of opioids (morphine-like substances or pain killers). An epidural consists of inserting a catheter (a narrow tube) into the epidural space (the virtual space surrounding the membrane that contains cerebrospinal fluid and the spinal cord) and infusing a solution of local anaesthetic (substance that cuts pain transmission to the brain) (alone or in combination with opioids) to anaesthetize the abdomen. This Cochrane review compares the effects of an epidural containing a local anaesthetic with those of an opioid-based regimen on the postoperative course after abdominal surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Search dates</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to December 2014. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of &#8216;Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the next review update.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 128 trials with 8754 participants of both sexes aged between 33 and 76 years in the review and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Three trials reported that their trial was officially registered.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Study funding sources</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic reduces the time required for return of gut function compared with an opioid-based regimen (equivalent to 17 hours). An epidural providing a local anaesthetic and an opioid also reduce pain (equivalent to a reduction of 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery) and time spent in hospital for open surgery (equivalent to one day). We found no evidence that an epidural with a local anaesthetic would affect the incidence of vomiting or poor healing of the gut.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence as high for return of gastrointestinal function, moderate for pain treatment, low for no effect on vomiting or healing of the gut and very low for reduced time spent in the hospital after open surgery.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-11 13:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastrointestinal paralysis, nausea and vomiting and pain are major clinical problems following abdominal surgery. Anaesthetic and analgesic techniques that reduce pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while preventing or reducing postoperative ileus, may reduce postoperative morbidity, duration of hospitalization and hospital costs. This review was first published in 2001 and was updated by new review authors in 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-07-11 14:00:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare effects of postoperative epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics versus postoperative systemic or epidural opioids in terms of return of gastrointestinal transit, postoperative pain control, postoperative vomiting, incidence of anastomotic leak, length of hospital stay and costs after abdominal surgery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-11 14:01:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified trials by conducting computerized searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1950 to December 2014) and EMBASE (from 1974 to December 2014) and by checking the reference lists of trials retained. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of &#8216;Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these studies into formal review findings during the next review update.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-11 14:11:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We rated the quality of studies by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently extracted data and judged the quality of evidence according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) scale.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 17:28:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 128 trials with 8754 participants in the review, and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other studies.</P>
<P>Results of 22 trials including 1138 participants show that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic will decrease the time required for return of gastrointestinal transit as measured by time to first flatus after an abdominal surgery (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.71 to -0.86; high quality of evidence; equivalent to 17.5 hours). The effect is proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used. A total of 28 trials including 1559 participants reported a decrease in time to first faeces (stool) (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.47; low quality of evidence; equivalent to 22 hours). Thirty-five trials including 2731 participants found that pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery was also reduced (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.70; moderate quality of evidence; equivalent to 2.5 on scale from 0 to 10). From findings of 22 trials including 1154 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.23; low quality of evidence). From investigators in 17 trials including 848 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.32; low quality of evidence). Researchers in 30 trials including 2598 participants noted that epidural analgesia reduced length of hospital stay for an open surgery (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.04; very low quality of evidence; equivalent to one day). Data on costs were very limited.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 14:38:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An epidural containing a local anaesthetic, with or without the addition of an opioid, accelerates the return of gastrointestinal transit (high quality of evidence). An epidural containing a local anaesthetic with an opioid decreases pain after abdominal surgery (moderate quality of evidence). We did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting or anastomotic leak (low quality of evidence). For open surgery, an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would reduce the length of hospital stay (very low quality of evidence).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-15 14:33:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-11 15:12:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 2011, nearly 29% of hospital stays and 48% of hospital costs in the United States (USA) involved operating room procedures (<A HREF="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb165.jsp">http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb165.jsp</A>). Among the 15 procedures most commonly performed in the USA were cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration (129.4 per 100,000 population), abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy (99.4 per 100,000 population), colorectal resection (97.4 per 100,000 population), excision or lysis of peritoneal adhesions (97.4 per 100,000 population), appendicectomy (93.3 per 100,000 population) and oophorectomy (71.3 per 100,000 population). Thus abdominal surgery represents a significant proportion of hospital stays and costs. Gastrointestinal paralysis and postoperative pain are two major issues that need to be taken care of after abdominal surgery.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal paralysis following abdominal surgery may result in prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. Following laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy, approximately 10.3% of patients will have an ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2015</LINK>). An ileus occurs more frequently in colectomy than cholecystectomy and more often when performed by laparotomy. Patients with ileus receiving opioids will have an increased length of hospital stay (ranging from 4.8 to 5.7 days), greater total costs (from USD 9,945 to USD 13,055) and a higher 30-day all-cause readmission rate (2.3% to 5.3% higher) compared with patients without an ileus (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2000, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) suggested that pain should be considered as the fifth vital sign, and that under-treatment of pain would constitute abrogation of a fundamental human right (<LINK REF="REF-White-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2007</LINK>). After this statement was issued, an increase in the use of opioids for acute postoperative pain treatment was observed, as was an increase in their side effects (<LINK REF="REF-White-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2007</LINK>). It was also noted that postoperative critical respiratory events were encountered more frequently during the first 24 hours after opioid therapy was introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Ramachandran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramachandran 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-11 15:12:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural anaesthesia or analgesia or both consist of injection of a local anaesthetic into the spine outside the dura mater. Epidural local anaesthetic may be used during abdominal surgery, sometimes as a replacement for general anaesthesia but most commonly as a supplement to general anaesthesia for surgery and for postoperative analgesia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-07-11 15:16:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural analgesia has been claimed to facilitate many of the steps through which a patient must go before returning to his or her preoperative functional level after a major abdominal surgery, including motility of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="STD-Th_x00f6_rn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thörn 1996</LINK>). As summarized in their review, Holte and Kehlet considered that "the pathogenesis of postoperative ileus is multifactorial, and includes activation of inhibitory reflexes, inflammatory mediators and opioids (endogenous and exogenous)" (<LINK REF="REF-Holte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holte 2002</LINK>). Epidural analgesia may promote a faster return to intestinal transit through various mechanisms including a reduction in opioid administration (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>), a blockade of sympathetic gut innervation (creating a relative parasympathetic predominance) and a direct effect of systemic local anaesthetics (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2010</LINK>). Thorn et al included 14 participants and demonstrated that the gastrointestinal electromyographic activity of participants who received epidurally administered bupivacaine was different from that of participants who received epidurally administered morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Th_x00f6_rn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thörn 1996</LINK>). Oral acetaminophen absorption (as demonstrated by the area under the curve of acetaminophen blood concentrations from zero to 60 minutes) was also greater among participants who received bupivacaine than among those given morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Th_x00f6_rn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thörn 1996</LINK>). Thus an epidural containing a local anaesthetic may promote faster gastrointestinal transit return than is attained with systemic opioids.</P>
<P>Among undisturbed participants receiving patient-controlled morphine analgesia after surgery, abnormal breathing patterns with cyclical airway obstruction are extremely common (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2013</LINK>). Provided that pain relief would be at least equivalent to that achieved with opioid therapy, decreasing the quantity of opioids administered (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>) would make epidural analgesia with a local anaesthetic appear as an interesting alternative in the treatment of acute postoperative pain for the first days after abdominal surgery - the time when pain is most intense. Reducing the quantity of opioids administered after surgery may reduce the rare, but serious, adverse respiratory events associated with administration of opioids for the treatment of postoperative pain.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-11 15:18:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2001</LINK>) in which review authors concluded that an epidural with a local anaesthetic reduced the time to return of gastrointestinal transit but with substantial heterogeneity. The effect of additional epidural opioid on gastrointestinal function was unclear. We undertook this review to look for new studies, to update methods and to re-explore heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Two review authors (JG and DNN (DNN left the review before its completion) or MN) independently extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion and did not require assistance from a third review author. We extracted events and total number of participants in each group for dichotomous data when available. We extracted mean, standard deviation (SD) and number of participants in each group for continuous data when available. If results were not available in our favoured format or were provided on different scales, we extracted data as P values and number of participants for each group. When we were not able to extract data in any of these formats, we contacted study authors to obtain additional information from their trials. We did not use medians as estimates for means and did not estimate variances from interquartile or range. We extracted sites and dates of data collection (for exclusion of duplicate publications) and factors required for exploration of heterogeneity (see <LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>). After we had reached agreement, data were entered into RevMan (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/about-revman-5">http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/about-revman-5</A>) and into Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.044 (<A HREF="http://www.Meta-Analysis.com">www.Meta-Analysis.com</A>) (for exploration of heterogeneity and assessment of small-study effects and publication bias) by one review author (JG).</P>

<P>Two review authors (JG, DNN or MN) evaluated the methodological quality of selected studies with no assumption using the risk of bias assessment tool of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved disagreements by discussion. We rated as unclear elements for which the report provided insufficient information to allow us to make a clear judgement.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence of interventions:</I> We considered randomization adequate if it was generated by a computer or a random number table algorithm. We judged other processes, such as tossing of a coin, adequate if the whole sequence was generated before the start of the trial. We considered the trial as quasi-randomized if a non-random system, such as dates, names or identification numbers, was used.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Concealment of allocation:</I> We considered concealment adequate if the process that was used prevented patient recruiters, investigators and participants from knowing the intervention allocation of the next participant to be enrolled in the study. We considered concealment inadequate if the allocation method allowed patient recruiters, investigators or participants to know the treatment allocation of the next participant to be enrolled in the study.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Blinding of participants and personnel</I>: We considered blinding adequate if the participant and personnel taking care of the participant were blinded to the intervention. We considered blinding inadequate if the participant or personnel were not blinded to the intervention. We rated as unclear trials for which this was only partially adequately addressed (personnel blinded but not participants or vice versa, etc.).</LI>
<LI>
<I>Blinding of outcome assessment:</I> We considered blinding adequate if the outcome assessor was blinded to the intervention. We considered blinding inadequate if the outcome assessor was not blinded to the intervention.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</I>: We considered the trial adequate if all dropouts or withdrawals were accounted for, and if the number of dropouts was small (&lt; 20%), was similar for both interventions and reasons for dropping out seemed reasonable. We considered the trial inadequate for this specific item if reasons for dropping out of patients were not stated or did not sound reasonable, the number was high (&#8805; 20%) or the number was highly different between groups.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Selective reporting (reporting bias):</I> We considered the trial at low risk of bias if all measurements stated in the Methods section were included in the Results section. We rated the trial as having unclear risk of bias when some of the results were missing or insufficient information was provided (conference abstract). We rated the trial as having high risk of bias when important results (taking study author objectives into account) were mentioned in the Methods section but were not given in the Results section.</LI>
<LI>
<I>Any other risk of bias</I>: We considered any other reason that may have influenced study results. Per-protocol (not intention-to-treat) results were considered as introducing potential risk, and we rated these as having unclear risk. Differences between study groups in demographic characteristics were rated as presenting unclear or high risk, depending on their potential influence on review results. We rated study protocols at high risk when other treatment modalities differed markedly (e.g. high steroid dose was given to one group only, epidural local anaesthetic was part of a fast track programme applied to one group only).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-07-11 16:07:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reported results as risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data (vomiting and gastrointestinal anastomotic leak). Odds ratios (ORs) are not easily understood by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-McColl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McColl 1998</LINK>). All continuous data (time to first flatus, time to first faeces, pain scores, length of hospital stay and costs) included items entered as P values. Therefore it was not possible to provide results as differences in means and their 95% CIs. Instead we provided results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their CIs. For SMDs, we considered 0.2 a small difference, 0.5 a medium difference and 0.8 a large difference (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). For clinical correspondence, we multiplied the standard deviation (SD) of the control group of a study at low risk of bias, and when a typical SD was available, by the SMD. When we noted an effect, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) on the basis of the odds ratio, as this value is less likely to be influenced by the side (benefit or harm) on which data have been entered (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/">http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/</A>). When we observed no effect, we calculated optimal size information (number of participants needed for inclusion in a simple large trial) to justify a conclusion based on absence of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/">http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/</A>).</P>

<P>We analysed data with RevMan (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/about-revman-5">http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/about-revman-5</A>) and Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.044 (<A HREF="http://www.Meta-Analysis.com">www.Meta-Analysis.com</A>) by using fixed-effect (I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 25%) or random-effects models (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 25%). For continuous data, all analyses provided data that we could not enter in our favoured format (mean, SD and number of participants). In these situations, we chose not to consider a median as equivalent to a mean and did not estimate SD from quartiles. Instead we entered data into Comprehensive Meta Analysis as P values and numbers of participants. In such cases, mean differences cannot be obtained. We then transferred data in RevMan as generic variance and presented our results as standardized mean differences (SMDs). For SMDs, we considered 0.8 as the cutoff limit for a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). For clinical equivalents, we multiplied the SMD by the SD of a study at low risk of bias, and when a typical SD on a clinical scale was provided (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For dichotomous data, we provided results as risk ratios (values best understood by clinicians; <LINK REF="REF-McColl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McColl 1998</LINK>). For results in which the intervention produced an effect, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) by using the odds ratio (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/">http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/</A>). When results were negative, we also calculated optimal information size to ensure that enough participants were included in the retained studies to justify a conclusion based on absence of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html">www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We judged the quality of a body of evidence according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) system (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>) and presented this assessment in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro</A>) for all outcomes. For pain, we chose scores on movement at postoperative day one. For risk of bias, we judged the quality of evidence as high when most information was derived from studies at low risk of bias, and downgraded quality by one level when most information was obtained from studies at high or unclear risk of bias (allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors), or by two levels when the proportion of information obtained from studies at high risk of bias was sufficient to affect interpretation of results. For inconsistency, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 50% or higher without satisfactory explanation, and by two levels when the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic was 75% or higher without explanation. We did not downgrade the quality of evidence for indirectness, as all outcomes were based on direct comparisons were performed on the population of interest and were not surrogate markers (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). For imprecision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>), we downgraded the quality of evidence by one level when the CI around the effect size was large or overlapped an absence of effect and failed to exclude an important benefit or harm, or when the number of participants was less than the optimal information size; and we downgraded the quality by two levels when the CI was very wide and included both appreciable benefit and harm. For publication bias, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one level when correcting for the possibility of publication bias as assessed by Duval and Tweedie&#8217;s fill and trim analysis changed the conclusion. We upgraded the quality of evidence by one when the effect size was large (RR &lt; 0.5 or &gt; 2.0), and by two levels when the effect size was very large (RR &lt; 0.2 or &gt; 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). We applied the same rules for OR when basal risk was less than 20%. For SMD, we used 0.8 as the cutoff point for a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). We also upgraded quality by one level when we found evidence of a dose-related response. We upgraded quality by one level when the possible effect of confounding factors would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect. When the quality of the body of evidence is high, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. When quality is moderate, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. When quality is low, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. When the quality is very low, any estimate of effect is very uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

Some of the studies included in the previous version of this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2001</LINK>) did not include a group without local anaesthetics, as all groups received a neuraxial block with a local anaesthetic during surgery. For this reason (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for individual studies), some studies included in the previous version of this review do not appear among our included studies.

When this was done, the effect size was similar whether an opioid was (SMD -1.14, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.56; 11 trials including 575 participants) or was not (SMD -1.19, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.66; seven trials including 273 participants) added to the epidural infusion (mixed-effects analysis): P value for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 0.92 (Q = 0.011). For the same trials (local anaesthetic continued after surgery), when trials were subgrouped by type of surgery performed, a large effect (SMD &#8805; 0.8) was seen for gastrointestinal (SMD -1.26, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.80), abdominal aortic repair (SMD -12.86, 95% CI -15.98 to -9.73), gynaecological (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -1.86 to -0.62) and urological (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.18) surgeries only (mixed-effects analysis). Although a high (gastrointestinal surgery) or moderate (gynaecological surgery) amount of heterogeneity is seen, this heterogeneity comes from the amplitude in effect, because no trial favoured the opioid-based regimen over the epidural regimen with a local anaesthetic. If the following potency equivalences are assumed - lidocaine = 1, mepivacaine = 0.8, ropivacaine = 3, levobupivacaine = 3.9 and bupivacaine = 4 - for participants undergoing gastrointestinal, abdominal aortic repair, gynaecological or urological surgery, for whom the infusion was used after surgery, higher concentrations (in mg/mL) of local anaesthetic infusion after surgery would increase the amplitude of effect (P value = 0.0008) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). For laparoscopic surgery (one study with 50 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Taqi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taqi 2007</LINK>), the SMD would be -0.81 (95% CI -1.39 to -0.23). <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK> (mean and SD of the control group 71 ± 13.86 hours, respectively) revealed that 54 participants (27 per group) could eliminate a 15% difference in a simple trial (alpha = 0.05; beta = 0.2; two-sided test).</P>
<P>If a trial at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1995</LINK>) is used as the standard (SD of the control group 13.86 hours), the difference in gastrointestinal surgery would be equivalent to 17.5 hours.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We downgraded evidence by two levels for risk of bias because 75% or more of the studies included for this outcome were rated as having unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors. We did not downgrade evidence on the basis of inconsistency because a reasonable explanation was found for heterogeneity. We did not downgrade for indirectness because we included direct comparisons for the population of interest, and we did not consider time to first flatus as a surrogate marker for clinical evidence of gastrointestinal transit. We did not downgrade level of evidence for imprecision because the optimal information size was achieved. We did not downgrade evidence for publication bias because applying a correction would not modify the conclusion. We upgraded evidence by one level for a large effect size (SMD &gt; 0.8). We found no evidence of confounding factors to justify upgrading. We upgraded the level of evidence by one for a dose response (increasing the concentration of the local anaesthetic increased the effect size). We rated the level of evidence as high.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We downgraded the quality level by one for risk of bias because 50% or more of included studies were rated as having unclear or high risk for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. We downgraded the level of evidence for inconsistency on the basis of a moderate amount of heterogeneity. We did not downgrade for indirectness, as we included direct comparisons on the population of interest and did not consider time to first faeces as a surrogate marker for clinical evidence of gastrointestinal transit. We did not downgrade for imprecision because the optimal information size was achieved. We found no evidence of publication bias nor of large effect size, confounding factors to justify upgrading or dose-response effect. We rated the level of evidence as low.</P>

Egger's regression intercept showed no evidence of a small-study effect. Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis provided no evidence of publication bias. Trials were subgrouped by type of surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The effect was seen for gastrointestinal surgery (SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.42), urological surgery (SMD -1.16, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.67) and aortic abdominal repair (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.26) with no statistically significant differences between those three subgroups (Q = 3.604; P value = 0.17) (mixed-effects analysis). For a trial at low risk of bias with an average SD of 2.75 (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2008</LINK>), this would be equivalent to a decrease in visual/verbal analogue (VAS) score of 2.3 on a scale from 0 to 10.</P>

Egger's regression intercept showed the possibility of a small-study effect (P value = 0.047; two-sided test) as part of the heterogeneity. Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis calculated that two trials might be missing to left of mean for an adjusted point of estimate: SMD -1.32, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.79 (random-effects model). Trials were subgrouped by type of opioid in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). An effect was seen for trials in which an epidural with a local anaesthetic was compared with morphine (SMD -0.93, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.59), sufentanil (SMD -0.95, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.12) or tramadol (SMD -2.19, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.20), without a statistically significant difference between morphine and sufentanil (Q = 5.711, P value = 0.06).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of evidence for VAS scores on movement at 24 hours</HEADING>
<P>We downgraded level of evidence by two levels for risk of bias because 75% or more of the included studies were rated as having unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. We did not downgrade for inconsistency because we found reasonable explanations for heterogeneity. We used direct comparisons only with studies performed on the population of interest, and we did not consider pain scores to be surrogate markers for clinical pain. We did not downgrade for imprecision because the optimal information size was achieved. We did not downgrade the level of evidence for the possibility of publication bias because applying a correction for the possibility of one would not modify the conclusion. We upgraded level of evidence by one level for a large effect size (SMD &gt; 0.8). We found no evidence of confounding factors or dose-response effect to justify upgrading. We rated the level of evidence as moderate.</P>

<P>We downgraded level of evidence by two levels for risk of bias because 75% or more of the studies included for this outcome were rated as having unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. We downgraded level of evidence for inconsistency on the basis of a moderate amount of heterogeneity. We included direct comparisons of the population of interest and did not consider length of hospital stay as a surrogate marker. The optimal information size was achieved. We downgraded for publication bias because correcting for the possibility of one would modify the conclusion (absence of effect). We found no evidence of a large effect size nor of a dose-response effect. We upgraded level of evidence by one level for possible confounding factors, as hospital discharge may not actually reflect readiness for discharge. Participants must be ready to be discharged, but not all participants ready for discharge are discharged at that specific time. Delays may happen for various reasons (e.g. number of days in hospital fixed for each type of surgery at certain centres, no one available to sign for participant discharge, lack of help/assistance with assisted care at home). We found no evidence of a dose-response effect. We rated the quality of evidence as very low.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-07-12 15:42:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An epidural containing a local anaesthetic will decrease the time required for return of gastrointestinal transit, as measured by the time required to observe first flatus after abdominal surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (high quality of evidence; equivalent to 17.5 hours; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The effect is seen for almost every type of abdominal surgery and is proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic administered after surgery (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The optimal concentration required to obtain the maximal effect without impeding ambulation by producing motor blockade of the lower limbs may need to be determined in future trials/reviews. Adding an opioid to the mixture does not reduce the benefit. The exact duration of administration required may also need to be determined in future trials/reviews. The effect of an epidural with a local anaesthetic on time between surgery and first faeces was not as clear (quality of evidence low; equivalent to 22 hours; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Administration of the local anaesthetic only during the intraoperative period might not be sufficient to produce an effect. A reduced incidence of vomiting was seen only at relatively high local anaesthetic concentrations and for gynaecological surgeries. Return of gastrointestinal transit is an important goal to achieve after abdominal surgery, as it is generally considered to be required before hospital discharge, and because postoperative ileus will increase hospital costs (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2015</LINK>). Return of gastrointestinal transit as measured by time to first flatus or bowel movement is often chosen as an outcome measure in clinical trials evaluating recovery after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Neville-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neville 2014</LINK>). However, some study authors consider that passage of flatus or stool may reflect rectal emptying rather than effective gastrointestinal motility. A combination of food tolerance plus defecation has recently been reported as having a good positive predictive value to identify recovery of gastrointestinal transit compared with scintigraphic assessment (<LINK REF="REF-van-Bree-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bree 2014</LINK>). In the present review, positive effects on gastrointestinal transit translated to an interesting shortening of hospital stay for participants undergoing open surgery (very low quality of evidence). Data on cost were too limited to allow us to make any comment on them.</P>
<P>In 2000, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) suggested that pain should be considered as the fifth vital sign, and that under-treatment of pain should constitute abrogation of a fundamental human right (<LINK REF="REF-White-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2007</LINK>). After this statement was issued, an increase in the use of opioids for treatment of patients with acute postoperative pain was observed, as was an increase in opioid side effects (<LINK REF="REF-White-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2007</LINK>). Regional blockade interrupts pain transmission to the brain and may be used during the surgery itself as a replacement for general anaesthesia (regional anaesthesia), or for treatment of postoperative pain (regional analgesia). In adults, regional analgesic techniques decrease postoperative opioid consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>), making them a potentially interesting alternative or adjunct to opioid-based regimens for treatment of postoperative pain, provided of course that the efficacy would be at least equivalent. An epidural with a local anaesthetic has a clinically relevant effect on pain scores (moderate quality of evidence for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Not every patient will benefit to the same extent from an epidural with a local anaesthetic. Many factors will increase or decrease the beneficial effects. For patients themselves, the older the patient, the greater the difference in pain scores between an epidural with a local anaesthetic and an opioid-based regimen (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). For type of surgery, patients undergoing abdominal aortic repair, gastrointestinal surgery or urological surgery seem to be the ones for which an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would be most beneficial. The type of solution used also matters. Administering only a local anaesthetic through the epidural catheter will not produce a decrease in pain scores, at least from 24 hours and after, and this applies to pain scores both at rest and on movement. Fortunately, as mentioned above, adding an opioid to the mixture does not seem to decrease the benefit of the local anaesthetic for acceleration of gastrointestinal transit return. For the opioid added to the local anaesthetic, morphine, fentanyl and sufentanil seem to be equally effective for pain on movement. When an opioid is administered in the epidural space, blood concentrations achieved will vary according to the type of opioid used. A systemic effect of the opioid is to be expected. The type of opioid used in the control group as well as the route of administration may increase or decrease the difference in pain scores between an epidural containing a local anaesthetic and an opioid-based regimen. Pain reduction was noted regardless of the type of approach used (open vs laparoscopic). Thus the decision to use epidural analgesia after abdominal surgery versus other modalities has to be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account patient age, associated co-morbidities, relative contraindications and type of surgery performed.</P>
<P>When evaluating the benefit of an intervention, one must also consider potential side effects. Because they may increase the risk of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2006</LINK>), some clinicians have hypothesized that secondary extra fluid administration could increase sutures, oedema and anastomotic dehiscence. We did not find a difference in the incidence of anastomotic leak (low quality of evidence). Severe complications such as paraplegia or death related to epidurals when used for perioperative pain treatment in adults are fortunately very rare (1.0 to 6.1 per 100,000 procedures; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2009</LINK>) and are best evaluated by large prospective trials, as they are rarely reported in randomized controlled trials using neuraxial blocks (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-12 15:38:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An epidural with a local anaesthetic will accelerate the return of gastrointestinal transit by approximately 17 hours. The effect is proportional to the local anaesthetic concentration. To be effective, the solution may need to be administered after surgery - not solely intraoperatively. The effect of an epidural containing a local anaesthetic on gastrointestinal transit will translate to shorter hospital stay for open surgery only. An epidural with a local anaesthetic and an opioid improves pain scores (open or laparoscopic surgeries). Adding an opioid to the solution of local anaesthetic will improve pain scores without affecting gastrointestinal transit. When all studies were included, we did not find an effect on the incidence of vomiting or evidence to support any effect of an epidural with a local anaesthetic on the incidence of anastomotic leak of the gastrointestinal tractus.</P>

<P>We agree with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2001</LINK>) that an epidural with a local anaesthetic decreases time to return of gastrointestinal tract transit, as measured by time to first flatus after surgery. We found that heterogeneity observed in the previous version can be explained by the variety of local anaesthetic concentrations used in the included studies. We agree that an epidural that would contain only local anaesthetic offers no clear advantage over other modalities of treatment in terms of pain reduction. The epidural solution must contain a mixture of local anaesthetic and opioids to be more effective than other modalities of pain treatment after abdominal surgery.</P>

<P>This is an update. We made the following modifications to the previous version.</P>
<P>
<I>Study selection, types of participants:</I> We also included laparoscopic abdominal surgery.</P>
<P>
<I>Outcomes:</I>
</P>
<P>We limited the total number to seven.</P>
<P>We deleted the following.</P>
<P>Paracetamol absorption test as a measure of gastric emptying.</P>
<P>Passage of barium sulphate through the large intestine.</P>
<P>Nausea.</P>
<P>Surgical complications.</P>
<P>We added the following.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal anastomotic leak.</P>
<P>Length of stay in hospital.</P>
<P>Cost.</P>
<P>
<I>Data collection and analysis</I>
</P>
<P>Quality of study: We assessed study quality with the new Cochrane tool as presenting low risk, unclear risk or high risk of bias for randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.</P>
<P>We presented results for dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios. We provided continuous data measured on different scales or entered as P values as standardized mean differences. When this happened, we provided clinical equivalence. We assessed small-study effects with Eger's regression intercept and publication bias with Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis. We calculated the number needed for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome when appropriate. We calculated optimal information size when appropriate. We added meta-regressions for exploration of heterogeneity. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) recommendations. We added a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<P>To include maximal data with no assumption, we entered data expressed as median and range via another software, using the exact P value and the number of participants included in each group (a function not provided by RevMan). We then transferred data to RevMan as standardized mean difference (SMD) and standard error (SE). For this reason, results provided in the text (exact calculations from <A HREF="http://www.Meta-Analysis.com">www.Meta-Analysis.com</A>) may sometimes differ by a few decimal places from those noted in the Figures (automatically recalculated in RevMan from SMD and SE entered). Conclusions (effects found or not found) were never affected by these small differences.</P>

<P>A standard volume of lidocaine, fentanyl and preservative-free saline for epidural and intravenous administration was prepared in separate syringes, coded for blinding purposes, numbered and dispensed by the hospital pharmacy on the day of surgery. The pharmacist who dispensed study medications was not involved in any other aspect of the study. The anaesthesiologist in charge of the case was aware of group allocation for control group participants and was not involved in postoperative management or data collection. Sham epidural catheter: "The anaesthesiologist went through all the motions of placing an epidural catheter, including prepping and cleansing the skin, infiltrating the skin and interspinous regions with 2&#8211;3 ml lidocaine (2%), applying pressure as if inserting the needle, simulating loss of resistance, and threading of the catheter. The epidural needle was removed, and the exposed length of catheter was wrapped in gauze and taped to the patient&#8217;s back. A test dose of 3&#8211;5 ml normal saline was injected into the catheter that drained into the gauze"</P>
