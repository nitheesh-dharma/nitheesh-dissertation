<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 07:28:37 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, and drug treatment of high blood pressure can substantially reduce this risk. However, the control of high blood pressure in the community is far from optimal. One of the major reasons for this is that patients with high blood pressure often fail to take their medication as prescribed. A number of interventions have been tested that aim to help patients take their medication but it is still uncertain how effective they are.</P>
<P>This review evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to help patients with taking blood pressure lowering medication. We included studies in adult patients with a diagnosis of high blood pressure in a community setting and assessed interventions that aimed to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication. The outcomes assessed were adherence to medication and blood pressure changes.</P>
<P>For many interventions it is difficult to draw any real conclusions due to weaknesses of the included studies. However, reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy although there is little evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomised controlled trials to confirm these findings.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lack of adherence to blood pressure lowering medication is a major reason for poor control of hypertension worldwide. Interventions to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication have been evaluated in randomised trials but it is unclear which interventions are effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with high blood pressure</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>All-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with essential hypertension in primary care, with adherence to medication and blood pressure control as outcomes</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15519 patients. The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction.

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertension is a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease and poses a significant public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1990</LINK>). Randomized trials have demonstrated that treating high blood pressure with medication can substantially reduce the risk of stroke by 31 to 45 per cent and myocardial infarction by 8 to 23 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>). There is evidence that intensification of medication by means of treatment with two or more antihypertensive drugs is associated with improved blood pressure control (<LINK REF="REF-HDFP-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDFP 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-HDFP-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDFP 1984</LINK>). Despite the availability of effective treatments, the control of high blood pressure in the community is far from optimal, with lack of adherence to blood pressure lowering medication being a major factor (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Colhoun-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colhoun 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sackett-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sackett 1975</LINK>). Adherence in treated hypertensives is estimated to be between 50 to 70 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Caro-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caro 1995</LINK>), and the importance of improving adherence to long-term therapies has recently been addressed by the World Health Organization in a major report (<LINK REF="REF-Sabate-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabate 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of interventions aiming to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and five systematic reviews have tried to summarize the evidence in this field (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar_x002d_Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar-Jacob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Roter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roter 1998</LINK>). The searches in three of these reviews were limited to studies indexed only in MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar_x002d_Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar-Jacob 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2000</LINK>), thereby lacking in sensitivity and specificity (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>) and only included English language publications. None of these reviews could recommend any single approaches that increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication. The most recent and more general review used a more comprehensive literature search and included six studies in hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because more trials in this area have emerged recently (<LINK REF="STD-Blenkinsopp-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blenkinsopp 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Andrejak-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andrejak 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mehos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mehos 2000</LINK>), this prompted us to carry out a new systematic review of the literature to establish which types of interventions to increase adherence are most effective, using a more comprehensive search strategy and including publications in languages other than English. We also aimed to investigate and report the effect of individual interventions used in factorial trials.</P>

</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>RCTs of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults with a diagnostic label of essential hypertension (as defined in individual studies) in a primary care, outpatient or other community setting. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any intervention designed to enhance medication adherence, including the following:<BR/>1. Education of caregivers and patients (e.g. counselling, health education)<BR/>2. Simplification of dosage regimens<BR/>3. Involvement of allied health professionals (e.g. nurses, pharmacists)<BR/>4. Special monitoring (e.g. vial caps, blood pressure self-measurement)<BR/>5. Motivation (e.g. financial incentives, reminder packages, reminder aids including diaries or follow-up appointments)</P>
<P>Control groups should either have received no intervention or "usual care" and have similar characteristics as the intervention groups. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Adherence to medication (including any definition of adherence and noting how this was defined and measured in each study)<BR/>2. Blood pressure change in mmHg or change in blood pressure control according to the criteria used in each individual RCT. A 'net reduction' of blood pressure refers to the 'net' difference between the changes of blood pressure between baseline and follow-up in the intervention and control group.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria:<BR/>1. Interventions not designed to increase adherence<BR/>2. Participants suffering from secondary hypertension<BR/>3. Participants hospitalised as opposed to ambulatory<BR/>4. Study design not RCT<BR/>5. Results already reported in another publication<BR/>6. Full results not reported and further information not available from study authors</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We identified original RCTs by an all-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), which now includes all RCTs that can be found in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, in April 2002. We applied a systematic search strategy using a series of topic terms to define the condition of interest (see below). We screened the references of all retrieved articles to identify additional publications. We contacted 25 study authors and experts in the field about other relevant trials or unpublished material and obtained responses from 17 individuals .</P>

<P>This search strategy was amended slightly for further searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Identification<BR/>We assessed studies according to the Cochrane Handbook. Two investigators (KS, TF) assessed lists of citations and abstracts independently. Each reviewer indicated whether a citation was potentially relevant (i.e. appearing to meet the inclusion criteria), was clearly not relevant, or gave insufficient information to make a judgement. We resolved differences by discussion and attempted to obtain printed copies of all potentially relevant citations or full paper versions of those where insufficient information was available. Both investigators assessed copies of all presumably relevant articles independently according to the above criteria. To be included in the review, a study had to meet all our selection criteria. </P>
<P>Study Selection<BR/>We independently extracted data in duplicate concerning study design, methods, clinicians and patients, interventions, outcomes and potential sources of bias using a structured data collection form. As there is only a small amount of evidence available that masking reviewers reduces the risk of bias, we were not blinded to the source and the authors of publications.(<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>) A third rater (SE) verified the data extraction, and corrections were made where necessary. </P>
<P>Study evaluation<BR/>Due to the limited evidence on applying quality scores for individual RCTs we have presented RCT characteristics in a descriptive format, thereby providing a more accessible and more objective summary.(<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>) Two reviewers provided data for the table independently and in duplicate, which were verified by the third reviewer. Disagreements were handled in the same way as for study identification and selection. We contacted 25 corresponding authors of studies to request missing data and verification of study details.</P>
<P>Quantitative data analysis<BR/>Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the various methods that were used to measure adherence, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. We grouped and reported the individual arms of factorial trials separately in the respective groups.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 07:33:08 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We screened 1929 citations and included 38 studies that met all our predefined criteria, involving a total of 15519 patients and testing 58 different interventions. The table 'Characteristics of included studies' summarizes the characteristics of included RCTs, which were conducted between 1975 and 2000. We chose to report the interventions tested in factorial trials separately and treated these like individual studies.</P>
<P>The majority of trials were performed in the USA (n equals 21) and Canada (n equals 8) with the remainder located in Europe (n equals 8), Australia (n equals 1) and South Africa (n equals 1). Study participants fell into a number of different categories that included newly diagnosed patients, patients with established hypertension on medication, patients with controlled or uncontrolled hypertension, patients adherent or non-adherent to medication or infrequent attendees at clinic.</P>
<P>In view of a lack of a generally accepted categorization, we grouped studies arbitrarily into the following four pragmatic categories: (i) simplification of dosing regimens, (ii) patient education, (iii) patient motivation, support and reminders and (iv) complex health and organizational interventions including interventions in combination. </P>
<P>Adherence was measured in different ways, including self-report, direct questioning, pill counts, and the medication event monitoring system (MEMS®), which logs the time and date of each opening of a medication container. Various criteria for adherence were used in the different studies. All studies examined both men and women in varying proportions, and the duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 07:33:08 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was generally low (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The randomization process was reported and provided adequate concealment of allocation in only 10 out of the 38 studies (26 per cent). The outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation in 12 studies (31 per cent). Losses to follow-up were well documented in 33 studies (85 per cent). Only eight trials (21 per cent) reported a power calculation, and most of the remaining trials appeared too small to detect clinically important differences. None of the included studies fulfilled all the quality criteria.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>EFFECT ON ADHERENCE AND BLOOD PRESSURE<BR/>Individual RCTs reported results on adherence in many different ways, making a pooled analysis inappropriate. Nineteen studies reported an improvement in adherence alone, of which 13 also reported blood pressure changes. Seven RCTs found an improvement in adherence combined with a reduction in blood pressure, and in seven studies a reduction in blood pressure occurred without an increase in adherence. Fifteen of the included studies (26 per cent) did not report a blood pressure outcome, and none of the studies examined major clinical endpoints. </P>
<P>Please note that in the following section, the total number of RCTs (i.e. interventions) is 58 rather than 38. This is because some studies reported the results of factorial trials testing two or more different interventions, which we have evaluated separately.</P>
<P>(i) SIMPLIFICATION OF DOSING REGIMENS (nine study interventions)<BR/>Interventions evaluated in this category included once daily versus twice daily preparations of metoprolol, amlodipine, or enalapril. One study tested transdermal clonidine plus placebo tablets versus verapamil and a transdermal placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Burris-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Burris 1991</LINK>). Asplund and colleagues compared pindolol and clopamide combined in one tablet versus both drugs in separate tablets. </P>
<P>Simplifying dosing regimens improved adherence in seven out of nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andrejak-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andrejak 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baird-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boissell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Boissell 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Detry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Detry 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leenen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leenen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mounier_x002d_Veh.-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mounier-Veh. 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girvin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Girvin 1999</LINK>), with relative improvement in adherence ranging from 8 to 19.6 per cent. All five studies in this category that used objective outcome measurement (MEMS®) showed an improvement in adherence through the use of once-daily instead of twice-daily dosage regimens, although four of these compared two different drugs. Seven studies also reported blood pressure changes. Only one study showed an increase in adherence (90 versus 82 per cent, p less than 0.01) together with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 6 mmHg systolic (p less than 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Leenen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Leenen 1997</LINK>). However, the changes in diastolic blood pressure in this study were insignificant.</P>
<P>(ii) PATIENT EDUCATION (six study interventions)<BR/>Educational interventions in the included studies consisted of an educational programme via slides, audiotape and booklet (<LINK REF="STD-Sackett-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sackett 1975</LINK>), group education (<LINK REF="STD-Webb-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marquez_x002d_Contr.-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marquez-Contr. 1998</LINK>), written educational material (<LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>), and education via visual aids, lecture, discussion and knowledge test (<LINK REF="STD-Kerr-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient education seemed largely unsuccessful. Only a single and relatively small trial (n=110) improved adherence (93 versus 69 per cent, p less than 0.002) with no reported effect on blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Marquez_x002d_Contr.-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marquez-Contr. 1998</LINK>). This study used group education in groups of 15 people over 90 minutes and additional postal information leaflets at one, three and five months.</P>
<P>(iii) PATIENT MOTIVATION, SUPPORT AND REMINDERS (24 study interventions)<BR/>In this category, we included interventions such as special compliance dispensers (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eshelman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Eshelman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehder-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rehder 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McKenney 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993</LINK>), drug reminder charts (<LINK REF="STD-Gabriel-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gabriel 1977</LINK>), self-recording of blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zarnke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zarnke 1997</LINK>), monthly home visits (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1978</LINK>), teaching on self-determination (<LINK REF="STD-Nessman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nessman 1980</LINK>), counseling (<LINK REF="STD-Rehder-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rehder 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Park 1996</LINK>), nurse phone calls (<LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>), social support (<LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 1985</LINK>), small group training (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 1985</LINK>), postal reminders (<LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993</LINK>), and telephone-linked computer counselling (an interactive computer based telecommunications system that converses with patients in their homes between office visits to their physicians) (<LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 study interventions with mostly small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent (<LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gabriel-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gabriel 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nessman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Nessman 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McKenney-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McKenney 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirscht-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kirscht 1977</LINK>). All of these studies used methods of measuring adherence, such as pill counts, self-report, direct questioning, and prescription refill records, which are less reliable than electronic monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 1997</LINK>).

<P>(iv) COMPLEX HEALTH AND ORGANIZATIONAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING INTERVENTIONS IN COMBINATION (19 study interventions)<BR/>The interventions in this category consisted mainly of complex combined interventions or structured hypertension management (see table of included studies for further details).</P>
<P>Complex interventions increased adherence in eight out of 18 study interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Blenkinsopp-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blenkinsopp 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Burrelle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Burrelle 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Logan-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Logan 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sclar-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sclar 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1991</LINK>), ranging from five per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Worksite care through specially trained nurses improved adherence (67 per cent versus 49 per cent, p less than 0.005) and led to a net reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 4 mmHg between intervention and control groups (p less than 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Logan-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Logan 1979</LINK>). A combination of home visits, education and special dosing devices improved adherence in a small trial of 16 patients (92 per cent versus 71 per cent, p less than 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Burrelle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Burrelle 1986</LINK>). A strategy involving an educational leaflet, a telephone reminder, a mailed reminder and an educational newsletter was successful in both previously treated hypertensives ('medication possession ratio' 82 per cent versus 48 per cent, p less than 0.05) and those who were newly diagnosed (93 per cent versus 52 per cent, p less than 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Sclar-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sclar 1991</LINK>). Two fairly recent trials reported weak evidence of an effect of a patient-centered pharmaceutical care model in which pharmacists either used a structured, brief questioning protocol to identify patients' medication related problems and their information needs relating to hypertension and its treatment (compliance score 0.23 versus 0.61, p less than 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1998</LINK>), or a combination of structured brief questioning protocol with advice, information and referral to the family practitioner (62 per cent adherent versus 50 per cent, p less than 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Blenkinsopp-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blenkinsopp 2000</LINK>). In this study, blood pressure was also better controlled (i.e. blood pressure readings of 159/89 mmHg or below) in the intervention group (35.7 per cent became controlled versus 17.1 per cent, p less than 0.05), although blood pressure data were available only for a subset of participants.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Summary of key findings<BR/>In this systematic review we found RCTs that evaluated a number of strategies to improve adherence to blood pressure lowering medication, including simplification of dosing regimens, patient education, motivation, support, and reminders as well as complex health and organizational interventions including interventions in combination. Simplification of dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with improvement in adherence ranging from 8 to 19.6 per cent. Adherence in these studies was mainly measured with electronic monitors and these results confirm findings from past research. There was inconclusive evidence for the effect of motivational and more complex interventions. Education alone appeared largely unsuccessful. An effect on both adherence and blood pressure was only observed in seven out of 58 interventions (18 per cent). While an effect on both adherence and blood pressure was only observed for a minority of interventions, not all studies reported blood pressure outcomes.</P>
<P>INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS IN THE LIGHT OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH<BR/>This review differs from previously published reviews in that we used a more comprehensive search strategy and different methodology. Compared to the latest reviews on adherence enhancing strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>), we found and included considerably more studies (nine and 32 more studies respectively). The review by Morrison extracted categorical data in preference to continuous data and ignored evidence from trials where data could not be converted. This may have been particularly relevant for the results in the group with changes in medication dosing, where we come to the opposite conclusion. This review is also different in that we have reported the results from individual arms of factorial trials separately.</P>
<P>We agree with the review by McDonald et al that for complex interventions it is often difficult to estimate the independent effects of individual interventions (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>). It also remains difficult to disentangle specific adherence effects as opposed to non-specific effects of increased attention. Our findings confirm that even the most effective interventions do not appear to lead to large improvements in adherence and blood pressure reductions. However, clinical outcomes were not measured and BP measurements were not included in all of the studies. </P>
<P>An earlier review of research on adherence reported benefits of educational interventions in improving adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar_x002d_Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar-Jacob 1991</LINK>). However, we were unable to confirm this finding, perhaps because our review was limited to evidence from randomised trials only.</P>
<P>LIMITATIONS OF THIS REVIEW</P>
<P>Comparing the RCTs included in this review was difficult. Many RCTs showed marked heterogeneity in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes. Study authors also measured and reported adherence inconsistently. Individual RCTs demonstrated variable and often poor methodological quality, particularly with regard to randomization, blinding of outcome assessment and losses to follow-up, whilst the sample sizes of many trials were too small to detect clinically relevant differences. Rather surprisingly, 15 out of the included 38 studies (39%) did not report a blood pressure outcome, and none reported major clinical endpoints.</P>
<P>There are also some difficulties in interpreting the results of this systematic review. Adherence was measured (e.g. self-report, pill counts, direct questioning, electronic monitoring, drug blood levels) and calculated in different ways (e.g. using arbitrary cut-off points to define adherence such as 80%), and in addition was usually assessed unblinded to allocation status, which made the comparison of RCTs difficult. Levels of adherence in the control groups of the trials studied ranged from 12% to 94%, which is indicative of the heterogeneity in both criteria for defining adherence and the participants studied. With no agreed definitions on how adherence should be measured and defined, it is not surprising that for most interventions the impact on adherence and blood pressure appears to be variable. Because of the different definitions for adherence that have been adopted in individual RCTs, it has not been possible to examine the relationship between adherence to medication and subsequent blood pressure control. Our categorization and grouping of trials was arbitrary, and the group allocation of some trials might be debatable.</P>
<P>It is possible that the interventions tested in the factorial trials were not independent from each other. Particularly in the case of complex interventions evaluated in factorial trial designs, interactions are likely, and the results have therefore to be interpreted with caution. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our findings suggest that introducing simpler dosing regimens can be effective in improving adherence, but the effect on subsequent blood pressure reduction has not been established and may not be clinically important. The results of various motivational and more complex interventions are promising, although there is insufficient evidence to suggest a single approach. </P>
<P>We suggest that innovative approaches should be introduced in the context of further RCTs. It is important that physicians are aware of the various reasons for poor adherence and aim to simplify dosing regimes as far as possible.</P>
<P>Different health professionals were involved in delivering the interventions in the studies included in this review. In many countries, the role of allied health professionals such as nurses or physician assistants is expanding, which may lead to new management opportunities for tackling adherence-related problems in patients with high blood pressure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The results of this review highlight a number of problem areas in adherence related research. Many studies used unreliable methods of measuring adherence such as self-report and pill counts. It appears that electronic monitoring provides more objective and reliable results and, in addition, produces data on medication taking patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 1997</LINK>). Although a large number of studies have been conducted in this area, larger trials of higher quality are needed that use reliable methods of measuring adherence and that also investigate the relationship between adherence and blood pressure reduction. We feel this is particularly important in the context of an increasing elderly population of people who often take multiple medications. </P>
<P>Hypertensive patients may fail to take their medication due to the long duration of therapy, the symptomless nature of the condition, side effects of medication, complicated drug regimens, lack of understanding about hypertension management, lack of motivation and the challenge to individual patients' health beliefs (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dowell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowell 2002</LINK>). It would seem logical that future studies should try and adopt a 'tailored' approach aimed at individual patients and addressing the above mentioned barriers to adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Working-Party-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Working Party 1997</LINK>). Combinations of strategies that include simpler dosage regimens, patient motivation and that involve other health professionals in a patient-centered approach should be further investigated. In addition, patients' views should be taken into account when piloting interventions, and the interventions themselves should be based on shared decision-making in a partnership between patient and practitioner (<LINK REF="REF-Bowling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowling 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sieber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sieber 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rand-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is paramount that every study that evaluates an intervention to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication should also measure blood pressure as a second outcome to help examine the relationship between adherence and blood pressure control.</P>
<P>Finally, only one RCT underwent an economic evaluation, which showed that nurse-led work-site care was not cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio almost double that of usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Logan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Logan 1983</LINK>). It is important that future studies include economic analyses because adherence interventions will generally have cost implications. Adherence to blood pressure lowering medication must persist long-term to show a clinically relevant benefit. Many studies included in this review had a follow-up period of less than six months (see table of Characteristics of Studies). We therefore suggest that interventions in future studies should be tested over a period of at least six months.</P>
<P>We conclude that simplification of dosing regimens appears to be the most promising intervention to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the poor methodological quality and heterogeneity of trials included in this review. Our findings emphasize the need for further RCTs with sufficient power and of rigorous methodology.</P>
