<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>A Cochrane systematic review assessing topical antibiotics without steroids for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations, in participants of any age</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is an infection of the middle ear with pus and a persistent perforation in the eardrum. It is a common cause of preventable hearing impairment, particularly in low and middle-income countries. This review assesses topical antibiotics (without steroids), to clarify whether they are better than no treatment or aural toilet (cleaning of the ear discharge), or treatment with topical antiseptics and to identify which antibiotic is best. Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included (1,724 analysed participants or ears); most were poorly reported, and some included a range of diagnoses.</P>
<P>Quinolone antibiotic drops (considered to be the 'gold standard' topical antibiotics) are better than no drug treatment or antiseptics at drying the ear. The effects of non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) when compared to antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect evidence suggests a benefit of quinolones cannot be ruled out. Less is known about longer-term outcomes (producing a dry ear in the long term, preventing complications, healing the eardrum, and improving hearing), or about treating complicated CSOM. The evidence in these trials about safety is also weak. More research is needed to assess whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than with alternative topical treatments.

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-30 17:42:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronically discharging ears associated with underlying persistent eardrum perforations (chronic suppurative otitis media, CSOM) are a common cause of preventable hearing impairment in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-McPherson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPherson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). CSOM usually occurs in the first five years of life (although it often persists into adulthood), and is related to poor socio-economic conditions. Therefore, while this review aims to address the global perspective of CSOM, much of the information discussed here relates to low-income settings and may differ in developed countries (e.g. age distribution).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>CSOM is one of several types of otitis media (infection of the middle ear). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines CSOM as "a stage of ear disease in which there is chronic infection of the middle ear cleft, a non-intact tympanic membrane (i.e. perforated eardrum) and discharge (otorrhoea), for at least the preceding two weeks" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), although this could more strictly be considered a childhood definition. Perforations and infection can be in one ear (unilateral) or both (bilateral). A variety of underlying pathologies can cause CSOM including: an acute episode of acute otitis media that has burst the ear drum and not settled within two weeks; a recurrent episode of acute otitis media in an ear with a perforation from a previous episode of acute otitis media; or an ear with a persistent perforation with active chronic otitis media with metaplastic changes to the mucosa of the middle ear and mastoid air cell system (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2003</LINK>, personal correspondence). In adults, the majority of patients are likely to have CSOM with a perforation<B> </B>that will not spontaneously heal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What are the effects of CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>Hearing impairment, aside from the disability from recurrent ear discharge, is the most frequent effect of CSOM.<B> </B>A school survey in Kenya found 63% of ears with CSOM had more than 30 decibels (dB) hearing loss, compared to only 3.4% of ears without outer or middle ear pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 1995</LINK>). Hearing impairment due to otorrhoea and a perforated eardrum will usually improve as the disease resolves. However, untreated CSOM may result in permanent hearing loss due to damage to the ossicles which transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the cochlea. Because otitis media occurs mostly in children during preschool years, the years in which the most dynamic phase of speech and language development occurs, there is concern that the associated hearing deficits may result in speech and language delays or permanent learning disabilities, as well as disturbances in behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to hearing impairment (with its associated consequences), complications of otitis media can often result in death or severe disability, especially in low-income countries<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>), where immunity, housing conditions, and access to medical services are often poorer than in high income settings. The infection may extend and spread to the head and neck structures and to the brain. Intracranial infections include meningitis, abscesses, hydrocephalus, or thrombosis of the lateral venous sinus (from suppuration within the mastoid causing clots occluding the lumen of the vessel) (<LINK REF="REF-Ludman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludman 1997</LINK>). Alternatively complications may be extracranial, such as subperiosteal abscess (superficial accumulations of pus that have broken the bony mastoid cortex), facial paralysis, cholesteatoma (a destructive formation of layers of keratinising epithelium, accumulating in the middle ear and mastoid (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1996</LINK>), also described as 'active squamous (epithelial) chronic otitis media (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 1997</LINK>)), labyrinthitis (extension to the labyrinth through the round window), or acute mastoiditis (spread of the infection to the mastoid air cells), which may spread further due to necrosis of the bony wall of the cells resulting in further life-threatening complications (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How much of a burden is CSOM?</HEADING>
<P>Around 91% of the burden of otitis media (all types) and nearly all related deaths occur in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Reliable data on prevalence of CSOM are uncommon. One study estimated it at 1.1% in Kenyan school children (<LINK REF="REF-Hatcher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatcher 1995</LINK>) and a review of school and community-based studies reported a prevalence between 0.4% and 6.1% in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1995</LINK>). Data from the World Health Organization and World Bank suggest the global burden of otitis media has dropped dramatically since 1990, to approximately 6000 deaths (0.01% of all deaths) and 1,474,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (0.1% of all DALYs) worldwide in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Most of these deaths are likely to be due to chronic otitis media and its complications, because acute otitis media is usually a self-limiting infection (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although most of the background literature cited in this review relates to children, reliable and generalisable data for the global burden in children are not readily available; the WHO estimates therefore quoted here are for both adults and children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What are the causes of CSOM? </HEADING>
<P>The causes and risk factors associated with CSOM are unclear, and few studies have examined these for CSOM. Instead authors have extrapolated results of studies for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion to CSOM. However these studies often have conflicting findings, and there is no proven correlation between the various host and environmental factors associated with CSOM and the factors associated with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. Despite this, some important factors that may be associated with CSOM include: environmental factors such as inadequate treatment (of CSOM and acute otitis media), poor access to medical care, poor socioeconomic conditions, season, exposure to tobacco smoke, overcrowding, attendance at day care centres, lack of breastfeeding, or poor nutrition or hygiene; and host factors such as altered immunity and underlying diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2003</LINK>), frequent upper respiratory tract infections), early onset of otitis media in the first months of life, and family history of otitis media. Some populations are at increased risk of developing CSOM, and have high rates reported, including certain ethnic groups (such as Native American tribes of Apache and Navajo, Australian Aborigines, and Inuits of Canada, Greenland and Alaska), and individuals with anatomical defects (e.g. cleft palate or submucous cleft), altered physiological defences (Eustachian tube dysfunction) or Down's syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What management approaches are there?</HEADING>
<P>The aims of treatment are to stop the discharge (and to eradicate infection), to heal the tympanic membrane, improve hearing, prevent the common problems of recurrent or new infections, and to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. Treatment options for uncomplicated CSOM include dry mopping, ear wicking, gentle syringing, or suctioning, to clean the ear discharge (aural toilet); systemic antibiotics (e.g. oral antibiotic preparations, or intravenous antibiotics); and topical treatment with either antiseptics or antibiotics, sometimes with steroids. If complications develop, surgery is usually required to remove the infected tissue from the middle ear and mastoid air cells, and possibly repair the damaged eardrum and ossicles. Each of these treatments will be considered in the following Cochrane reviews:<BR/>

</B>A report of a WHO/Ciba Foundation workshop held in 1996, recommends administration of topical (and/or systemic) antibiotics as well as dry mopping/wicking, since wicking alone is suggested to be ineffective (as found by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). However, the WHO guidelines still currently recommend treating CSOM by using wicking to dry the ear alone (and a five-day follow-up).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Topical treatment with antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>A number of topical antibiotics have been used in the treatment of CSOM. However, concern exists regarding their ability to penetrate the middle ear and mastoid cavities as well as their activity against the causative bacteria (usually gram-negative). There also remains controversy and uncertainty about the possible ototoxic effect, in particular of topical aminoglycoside antibiotics (by damaging the hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea), particularly where the eardrum is not intact. The newer 4-quinolone antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are widely considered to be the 'gold standard' topical antibiotics, but are expensive and not generally available as ototopical preparations in many countries. Topical antibiotics may be superior to topical antiseptics, although this needs investigating, particularly as topical antiseptics are cheap and easily available, and are thus widely used in many low and middle-income countries.</P>

<P>Carolyn Macfadyen (CM) and Jose Acuin (JA) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy to identify potentially relevant trials.</P>
<P>CM retrieved the full papers for all potentially relevant studies, and assessed their eligibility to be included in the review using an eligibility form based on the stated inclusion criteria. We identified multiple publications from the same data set and reported these as one trial. Where outcomes are not reported, we contacted the author of the paper for this information, as the data may have been collected but not reported. We excluded studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria for this review and stated the reason in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for clarification.</P>
<P>JA and Carrol Gamble (CG) provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion, and the three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 18:10:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CM extracted data of study characteristics, including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes, and recorded these on standard forms. JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). In studies where data are insufficient or missing, we contacted the authors of the original studies for additional data and/or verification of methods, to clarify any uncertainties about the data and the way in which they were collected, and to try to obtain missing data.</P>
<P>CSOM can occur in one or both ears for each participant, which means participants can be counted more than once if ears are used as the unit of analysis. Where outcomes were reported in number of ears only, we also attempted to obtain the values for number of participants; numbers of ears were used where this information could not be obtained. We checked the data and resolved any discrepancies by referring to the trial report, through discussion.</P>
<P>Where possible we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. the analysis should include all the participants in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned). If the number randomised and the numbers analysed were inconsistent, we calculated a per cent loss-to-follow-up and reported this information in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. For binary outcomes, we recorded total number of participants (or ears, where participant numbers were unavailable) and number with the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes, for each group, we extracted the number of participants, and the arithmetic means and standard deviations. If the data were reported using geometric means, we planned to extract standard deviations on the log scale. We planned to extract medians and ranges, and report these in additional tables if any trials reported these.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-30 17:47:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CM assessed the methodological quality of all the trials identified as eligible for inclusion. CG reviewed trials where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, and JA provided further information where this had already been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for further clarification.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and inclusion of randomised participants. We classified generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and inclusion of randomised participants as adequate, inadequate and unclear as outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>. Blinding is classified as double blind, single blind, or open.</P>

</U>
</B>In studies that enrolled people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media, as well as CSOM, we only included the results for <B>just </B>CSOM participants if the authors reported accounting for diagnosis at randomisation (e.g. stratified by diagnosis) and presented results by diagnosis. Where information was not reported regarding whether alternative diagnostic groups were accounted for at randomisation, we included all participants (groups may be unbalanced, and decisions by trialists to report subgroups may have been linked to trend). We also included all participants where separate results were not available. See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for details. For crossover trials, we have only taken the results before participants were crossed over to the alternative treatment, where possible; otherwise results for all participants combining pre and post-crossover data were used.</P>
<P>For binary data, we combined trials using relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We combined trials with continuous data using the weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval. Where data have been reported using medians and ranges, or there is evidence of skewed data, we reported medians and ranges where possible (dividing mean by the standard deviation (SD); results of &lt; 1.64 indicate a positive skew). If continuous data were reported using geometric means, we combined the findings on a log scale and report on the original scale.</P>
<P>Quinolone and non-quinolone topical antibiotic treatments are not combined across trials. This was done to avoid counting patients in the antiseptic arm twice for trials that compared a quinolone with a non-quinolone and an antiseptic. There is also clinical interest in the difference in effectiveness of quinolones compared to non-quinolones, as quinolones are thought to be more effective and safer but more expensive.</P>
<P>Where heterogeneity is considered to be present, and it remained clinically appropriate to combine data, we also used the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model, and reported both fixed-effect and random-effects results.</P>
<P>The primary analysis is of all eligible studies. If a sufficient number of trials is available for future updates (not available for each comparison in this version of the review), we will explore whether heterogeneity can be explained using subgroup analyses or meta-regression for the following factors: age (under 16, and adults 16 years or older), associated mopping (dividing studies into those with some form of ear toilet, and those without), co-interventions (dividing studies into those with treatment comparison alone, and those with treatment comparison in combination with other co-interventions), and methodological quality (initially excluding studies of the poorest quality). Sensitivity analyses will also be used to explore methodological quality (notably adequate concealment), and trial design (e.g. cluster randomisation). We will display the results for each sensitivity analysis according to the subgroups within each methods category.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analysis will include the following, as outlined in the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Group 'Guidelines for Reviewers' (<LINK REF="REF-CochraneENTGuideline" TYPE="REFERENCE">CochraneENTGuideline</LINK> updated November 2000).</P>
<P>(1) Repeat the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any).<BR/>(2) Repeat the analysis excluding studies of the lowest quality (already done if there is heterogeneity).<BR/>(3) If there are one or more very large studies, we will repeat the analysis excluding these, to investigate how much they dominate the results.<BR/>(4) Repeat the analysis excluding studies where people with CSOM are only a subgroup of the participants included in the study, for example, those that enrol people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media, as well as CSOM.</P>
<P>Within this version of the review, trials where people with CSOM are only a subgroup of the participants included in the study are identified - see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this version of the review, we visually examined forest plots, in conjunction with the chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, using a 5% level of statistical significance, and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2004</LINK>). There were insufficient trials to investigate publication bias using funnel plots; this may be done in further updates of the review.</P>

We accepted the authors' definitions when assessing eligibility.</P>
<P>Three trials included otitis externa and draining mastoid cavities; all analysed and presented results separately, but two did not report how or whether randomisation was stratified by diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Clayton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Clayton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyde-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gyde 1981</LINK>) and although one stated that type of infection was the principal criterion for randomisation by minimisation, it is not clear whether this relates to diagnosis or bacteriology (<LINK REF="STD-Gyde-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gyde 1978</LINK>); all participants are therefore included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Browning-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Browning 1983a</LINK> also included participants with draining mastoid cavities, and <LINK REF="STD-Fradis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fradis 1997</LINK> reported surgical perforations in three ears although prior middle-ear surgery was an exclusion criterion; neither trial reported the results separately, and all participants are also included in this review. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> provides further details with numbers involved.</P>

<P>Where available, we have reported results for number of participants rather than ears; otherwise results for number of ears have been taken. The concern is that a trial analysed by ears rather than number of participants will have an underestimated standard error (SE) and therefore receive an inappropriate increased weight in a meta-analysis.

<LINK REF="STD-Macfadyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Macfadyen 2005</LINK> showed greater hearing improvement on ciprofloxacin than boric acid at two and four weeks. Hearing threshold was averaged across four frequencies, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz (for one single reading for diseased ear, or averaged across the two ears in bilateral cases). Results from ANCOVA, controlling for baseline audio level, for the difference in mean improvement are: 2.17 (95%CI 0.09 to 4.24) at two weeks, and 3.43 (95%CI 1.34 to 5.52) in favour of ciprofloxacin at four weeks - see <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 18:13:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review considers alternative topical drug treatments, but does not compare treatment regimens or delivery methods. We also excluded comparisons with steroids (with or without antibiotics; see steroids review) or systemic treatments, and presented results for quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics separately, to address focused and meaningful questions. These tighter comparisons and the addition of new trials, are why our conclusions differ to those of an earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 1998</LINK>). The earlier review included systemic non-quinolones and antibiotic-steroid combinations in this comparison, leading to a stronger effect in favour of topical quinolones than found here; meanwhile only three trials were included in the earlier antibiotic versus antiseptic comparison, one of which used steroids, and no statistically significant difference had been found. The following discusses the findings of this new review.</P>
<P>Topical antibiotics were superior to no drug treatment for curing CSOM at one week, when both groups received aural toilet. However, this was based on two small trials, both using quinolone antibiotics, with no longer-term follow-up.</P>
<P>Only two trials compared different topical non-quinolone antibiotics; no statistically significant difference was detected between trimethoprim-sulfacetamide-polymyxin B (TSP) and gentamicin (for cure rates or level of hearing), although TSP was better than trimethoprim-polymyxin B. However, these results included participants with a range of diagnoses, and rates differed between diagnoses.</P>
<P>Of the trials that compared topical quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, only one found an effect in favour of topical quinolones (<LINK REF="STD-Tutkun-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tutkun 1995</LINK>, reporting at day 11); the other trials found no statistically significant difference at one week or up to three weeks, although <LINK REF="STD-Kaygusuz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kaygusuz 2002</LINK> did show a trend in favour of quinolones at two weeks but numbers were small with wide confidence intervals. Excluding <LINK REF="STD-Tutkun-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tutkun 1995</LINK> (which received 28% and 26% of the weight for results at two weeks and two to three weeks respectively) from the results for discharge gave pooled estimates detecting no statistically significant difference at any time-point. This trial also assessed hearing but found no significant difference between treatments in the level of hearing improvement at day 11.</P>
<P>When compared to topical antiseptics, topical quinolone antibiotics were more effective at curing CSOM. However, the findings for non-quinolones were more mixed, and any possible benefit decreased over time. Three of these trials included participants with a range of diagnoses, and treatment regimens varied widely. Other possible causes of the heterogeneity may be partly due to the different dropout rates between treatment groups for <LINK REF="STD-van-Hasselt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Hasselt 1997</LINK> (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for dropout rates), which was also the only study for the antiseptic comparisons that did not specify any blinding. Meanwhile <LINK REF="STD-Browning-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Browning 1983a</LINK> compared weekly insufflation of antiseptic after aural toilet by the otologist with daily non-quinolone antibiotics, and followed participants later than the other trials (four weeks). This was the only trial to find a result in favour of antiseptic, although the effect was not statistically significant, with confidence intervals crossing the line of no-effect.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Macfadyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Macfadyen 2005</LINK> dominated the quinolone versus antiseptic comparisons at two to four weeks, with 76% of the weight, due to its large size and narrow confidence intervals. Excluding <LINK REF="STD-Macfadyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Macfadyen 2005</LINK> from the quinolone versus antiseptics comparison increases the heterogeneity and confidence intervals, with a non-significant effect after accounting for heterogeneity. This trial reduced the heterogeneity and consolidated the results (with confidence intervals overlapping all the other trials), to pull the effect significantly in favour of quinolone antibiotics over antiseptics. The lack of heterogeneity in the results for this trial, and its impact on the pooled results, suggests the findings for this trial may be applicable to other settings. Using older dedicated children as 'ear monitors' to treat the participants at school, under teacher supervision, may have helped minimise treatment errors or sharing of the treatment with other members of the household or community. The effectiveness of the treatments may therefore be slightly higher than might be found in practice in resource-poor settings if treatment is to be applied at home. However, the resolution rates were lower than obtained by many trials in higher income settings, and/or in private clinics where treatment is done in the clinic. This may be partly due to better health and other environmental factors in richer settings, but also a reflection of the more pragmatic nature of this study than others, even with the child-to-child treatment approach. These rates are therefore more likely to reflect the actual resolution rates in developing countries than many other trials, and may also be more generalisable to higher-income settings than might be anticipated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Macfadyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Macfadyen 2005</LINK> found low healing rates with both quinolones antibiotic and antiseptic, although there was a trend towards a benefit of antibiotic over antiseptic by week two. This trial also reported improved hearing in both groups, with a greater improvement on antibiotic than antiseptic.</P>
<P>Antiseptics and non-quinolone antibiotics are often cheaper and more widely available than quinolone eardrops, and the findings presented here may have important implications in resource-poor settings.</P>
<P>Most trials did not report any adverse events. However, those that did discuss safety, supported a good profile for the topical treatments assessed; one trial also reported fewer local effects for quinolone antibiotic than for antiseptic in alcohol (<LINK REF="STD-Macfadyen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Macfadyen 2005</LINK>). None of the trials that assessed hearing in this review reported any evidence of ototoxicity; two reported a mild auditory disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Lorente-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 1995</LINK>, one case) or increase in bone conduction thresholds (<LINK REF="STD-Tutkun-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tutkun 1995</LINK>) after treatment with gentamicin (an aminoglycoside, non-quinolone, antibiotic), but stated that the hearing losses were not clinically (<LINK REF="STD-Lorente-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 1995</LINK>) or statistically (<LINK REF="STD-Tutkun-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tutkun 1995</LINK>) significant. However, ototoxicity has been observed for various non-quinolone antibiotics, and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not recommended in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 1997</LINK>). One review of ototoxicity cases in humans reported that ototoxicity may be primarily due to vestibular damage (causing imbalance and dizziness) rather than cochlear (<LINK REF="REF-Marais-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marais 1998</LINK>), so assessments of hearing thresholds for bone conduction alone would be unlikely to detect many cases (<LINK REF="REF-Marais-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marais 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lancaster-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lancaster 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The follow-up period in most trials included here was short, with few assessing the longer-term effects of treatment, and none reported time to resolution or to reappearance of discharge and perforation. As some conclusions changed over time, it may be important to investigate the longer-term effects in future trials.</P>
<P>Most of the trials in this review were poor quality, with short follow-up. Many included a range of participants (e.g. including otitis externa, or draining mastoid cavities; while some did not specify cholesteatomatous disease as an exclusion criterion). This may explain some of the heterogeneity found, since resolution rates may vary widely between diagnoses, and so make the results less applicable to any one type of disease. Trials were also inconsistent in approaches for handling and reporting bilateral disease. Where available, we have reported results for number of participants rather than ears; otherwise results for number of ears have been taken. The concern is that a trial analysed by ears rather than number of participants will have an underestimated standard error and therefore receive an inappropriate increased weight in a meta-analysis. We will use the information obtained to attempt to address the issues of inflated weighting for trials reporting numbers of ears, in a later update of this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Short courses of topical quinolone antibiotics are more effective than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics for the short-term resolution of otorrhoea from uncomplicated CSOM. The effects of non-quinolone antibiotics without steroids are less clear, when compared to antiseptics; studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolones and non-quinolones, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Less is known about longer-term outcomes (for dry ear, or to prevent complications, heal the eardrum, and improve hearing), or about treating complicated CSOM. Evidence regarding safety is also weak, and more research is needed to clarify the risk of ototoxicity with alternative topical treatments (about which there is much concern, particularly for aminoglycosides), and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones. Treatment should therefore be accompanied by regular medical follow-up and clinical vigilance, also monitoring for adverse effects of treatment (particularly for local effects or signs of ototoxicity), or for complications of the disease. Clinical staff should also advise patients and their caregivers on appropriate ear care, with aural toilet and effective instillation of the drops, ensuring the drops reach the site of infection to work effectively.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials should clarify the effects of non-quinolone antibiotics and what is the most appropriate topical treatment for CSOM. Adequately designed and powered clinical trials should focus on the effects on the longer-term natural history of CSOM, such as healing of the tympanic membrane, hearing improvement, prevention of complications, and also on further safety assessments. Other more comprehensive systematic reviews should also assess safety further, particularly to verify the risks of ototoxicity for alternative treatments. Trialists should also consider how they handle bilateral disease and also the type of participants included (or stratify randomisation by diagnosis if various diagnoses are included), to ensure the results are clinically relevant to a particular patient group. The cost effectiveness of alternative treatments, preferably through economic evaluations alongside clinical trials, would be valuable in guiding both clinical practice and health policy.</P>

<P>Jose Acuin (JA) was the primary author for the Cochrane Review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media', that this review replaces.</P>
<P>Carolyn Macfadyen (CM) designed the current review, in consultation with JA.</P>
<P>CM and JA worked with Gemma Healy (GH) and Carolyn Doree (CD), the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Search Co-ordinators, for the search strategy development. GH ran the initial electronic searches, and performed a preliminary screen of the search results; CD ran the search update in March 2005. Both searches were carried out independently.</P>
<P>CM and JA independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified during the search for preliminary assessment, and CM retrieved and reviewed the full papers for all potentially relevant studies. CM will organise retrieval of future unpublished studies, and will contact authors for additional information or clarifications where needed.</P>
<P>CM assessed the methodological quality of all trials identified for inclusion, extracted data, and entered data into Review Manager 4.2 for analysis. JA and Carrol Gamble (CG) provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion; CG reviewed those where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, for the methodological quality and data extraction; and JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (Acuin 1998). The three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>
<P>CM and CG have worked on one trial in the review (Macfadyen 2005); no third party input was enlisted for this trial.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2008-10-30 18:17:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following changes were made to the eligibility criteria and outcome measures from those stipulated in the protocol:</P>
<P>1. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA<BR/>Types of studies: quasi-randomised controlled trials were specified in the protocol but excluded from the review.</P>
<P>Types of participants:<BR/>Protocol: People of any age with a diagnosis of CSOM meeting the WHO definition<BR/>Review: any diagnosis of CSOM as defined by the trial authors.</P>
<P>Types of interventions - the following were stipulated in the protocol:<BR/>Intervention: topical (aural) antibiotics (all and individual)<BR/>Comparator: no intervention; placebo; other topical antibiotics with and without steroids; systemic antibiotics (all and individual); combination of topical and systemic antibiotics; antiseptics.</P>
<P>However, we have divided these trials into the following three reviews:<BR/>* Topical treatment with antibiotics (THIS REVIEW)<BR/>comparisons: no treatment or aural toilet, topical antiseptics, various topical antibiotics, excluding steroids<BR/>* Systemic versus topical treatments for CSOM<BR/>comparisons: any systemic treatment against any topical treatment excluding steroids<BR/>* Systemic or topical steroids, as monotherapy or combination therapy<BR/>comparisons: no treatment or aural toilet, topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics</P>
<P>2. OUTCOMES<BR/>Types of outcome measures - the following primary outcomes have been changed:<BR/>Protocol:<BR/>* Resolution of CSOM at 2 to 4 weeks and after 4 weeks, according to the following findings:<BR/>a) No report of otorrhoea<BR/>b) Disappearance of discharge on otoscopy<BR/>c) Healing of the eardrum perforation on otoscopy<BR/>d) Time to resolution of CSOM according to any other definition of resolution made by the authors, including improvement in mucosal appearance</P>
<P>Review:<BR/>* Resolution of CSOM at 2 to 4 weeks, and after 4 weeks, according to the investigators' criteria.<BR/>We have also analysed results for treatment failure rather than success.</P>
<P>The others were analysed as separate, secondary outcomes (where reported by trialists):<BR/>* Healing of perforation at 2 to 4 weeks, and after 4 weeks;<BR/>* Time to resolution of CSOM as defined by the investigators.</P>
<P>The other protocol outcomes were unchanged, except that results before 2 weeks were also included and reported separately.</P>
<P>3. SEARCH STRATEGY<BR/>The protocol stated that we would obtain all relevant studies regardless of publication status. However, trials reported in conference proceedings or on posters have not yet been sought, but will be sought for inclusion in an update of this review. Additionally, the further potential sources that we will search for future updates of this review, were also specified in the protocol for this review.</P>
<P>4. METHODS - REVIEWERS' CONTRIBUTIONS<BR/>The protocol stated that we would follow the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane ENT Group Guidelines for Reviewers (CochraneENTGuideline, updated November 2000), and that two reviewers (CM and JA) would independently:<BR/>* select trials (at least for electronic searches), review the titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy, and assess full texts for eligibility;<BR/>* assess the methodological quality of all trials identified as eligible for inclusion (and report the level of agreement between the two reviewers);<BR/>* extract data of study characteristics, including methods, participants, interventions and outcomes, and record these on standard forms; and<BR/>* enter data onto Review Manager 4.2.</P>
<P>However, while CM and JA independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy, only CM assessed the full texts for eligibility and methodological quality, extracted data, and entered data onto Review Manager 4.2. JA and CG provided a second opinion on trials CM had selected for inclusion; CG reviewed those where there was any ambiguity about the methods used, for the methodological quality and data extraction; and JA provided further information where this had been obtained from authors of trials included in the previous review 'Interventions for chronic suppurative otitis media' (Acuin 1998). The three authors resolved any disagreements through discussion.</P>
<P>5. MINIMISING CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS<BR/>The protocol also stated that where one of the authors has worked on a trial in the review, we will seek help from another person at the ENT editorial base, to minimise bias due to potential conflict of interests. However, CM and CG both worked on one trial, Macfadyen 2005; no third party input was enlisted.</P>
<P>6. ASSESSMENT OF METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY<BR/>The protocol stated that allocation concealment, and inclusion of randomised participants, would be assessed as inadequate if an allocation concealment approach was not reported, or it was not clear how many people were originally randomised into the trial, respectively. However, we have classed these as unclear.</P>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the following dimensions and criteria based on four methodological aspects.</P>
<P>a) Generation of allocation sequence</P>
<P>Adequate: if sequences are suitable to prevent selection bias and the method used is described.<BR/>Adequate methods include random numbers generated by computer, table of random numbers, drawing of lots or envelopes, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, throwing dice, or other methods of allocation that appear to be unbiased.</P>
<P>Unclear: stated but method not described.<BR/>The trial describes itself as being randomised but no further information is given.</P>
<P>Inadequate: if sequence could be related to prognosis.<BR/>Inadequate methods include case record number, date of birth, time, day, month or year of admission.</P>
<P>b) Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Adequate: if participants and investigators enrolling participants cannot foresee assignment. Adequate measures include a priori numbered or coded containers of identical appearance, central randomisation; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other descriptions that contained convincing elements of concealment.</P>
<P>Inadequate: trials in which the authors reported an approach that could not be considered adequate (e.g. methods of allocation such as alternation methods or use of case record numbers are not concealed).</P>
<P>Unclear: trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or allocation concealment was stated but method not described.</P>
<P>Baseline comparison of experimental groups will confirm whether treatment arm allocation appears to be unbiased.</P>
<P>c) Blinding</P>
<P>Double blind: the trial uses a placebo, or a double dummy technique such that neither the participant or care provider/assessor know which treatment is given.</P>
<P>Single blind: the participant or care provider/assessor is aware of the treatment given.</P>
<P>Open: all parties are aware of treatment.</P>
<P>d) Inclusion of all randomised participants</P>
<P>Adequate: More than 90% of people randomised in the trial were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Inadequate: Less than 90% of those randomised in to the trial were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>Unclear: It is not clear how many people were originally randomised into the trial or analysed.</P>
<P>7. DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>The protocol stated that we would only include the results for CSOM participants where available, for studies that also enrolled people with otitis externa, draining surgical cavities or acute otitis media. However, we only did so if the authors reported stratifying randomisation by diagnosis. Where information was not reported regarding whether alternative diagnostic groups were stratified at randomisation, we included all participants (groups may be unbalanced, and decisions by trialists to report subgroups may have been linked to trend).</P>
