To avoid pooling interventions which crossed arms in different trials, we divided bed rest into different degrees and created new comparisons of different degrees of bed rest.

<P>Not enough evidence to say if bed rest in pregnancy helps women and their babies when women have high blood pressure.</P>
<P>High blood pressure in pregnant women can contribute to babies being small, being born too soon and having considerable health problems. Women with high blood pressure are often advised to rest in bed either at home or in hospital. It is suggested that this might help to reduce the mother's blood pressure and so provide benefits for the baby. However, there may be adverse effects; for example, some women may find it stressful, it may contribute to blood clots in the legs and can put a burden on the woman's family. Although one small trial suggested that there may be some possible benefits, there are insufficient data to be confident. Moreover, trials did not address possible adverse effects of bed rest. More women seemed to prefer normal activity at home rather than resting in hospital, if a choice were given. Further research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:24:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bed rest or restriction of activity, with or without hospitalisation, have been advocated for women with hypertension during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcome. However, benefits need to be demonstrated before such interventions can be recommended since restricted activity may be disruptive to women's lives, expensive, and increase the risk of thromboembolism.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects on the mother and the baby of different degrees of bed rest, compared with each other, and with routine activity, in hospital or at home, for primary treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:24:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2010).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials evaluating bed rest for women with hypertension in pregnancy were selected.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion independently, and extracted data. Data were entered into RevMan software and double-checked.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four small trials (449 women) were included. Three were of good quality. Two trials (145 women) compared strict bed rest with some rest, in hospital, for women with proteinuric hypertension. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any differences between the groups for reported outcomes. Two trials (304 women) compared some bed rest in hospital with routine activity at home for non-proteinuric hypertension. There was reduced risk of severe hypertension (one trial, 218 women; relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.89) and a borderline reduction in risk of preterm birth (one trial, 218 women; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.99) with some rest compared to normal activity. More women in the bed rest group opted not to have the same management in future pregnancies, if the choice were given (one trial, 86 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.43 to 6.31). There were no significant differences for any other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Few randomised trials have evaluated rest for women with hypertension during pregnancy, and important information on side-effects and cost implication is missing from available trials. Although one small trial suggests that some bed rest may be associated with reduced risk of severe hypertension and preterm birth, these findings need to be confirmed in larger trials. At present, there is insufficient evidence to provide clear guidance for clinical practice. Therefore, bed rest should not be recommended routinely for hypertension in pregnancy, especially since more women appear to prefer unrestricted activity, if the choice were given.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:25:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Raised blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the commonest medical complications, occurring in 6% to 8% of all pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1996</LINK>). There are controversies about the definition of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and several classifications have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-ASSHP-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASSHP 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-North-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">North 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1993</LINK>). These are discussed in more detail in <LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>. However, most include the four main categories (a) chronic hypertension; (b) pre-eclampsia, characterised by hypertension with proteinuria; (c) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension; and (d) pregnancy-induced hypertension or gestational hypertension, transient hypertension without proteinuria. Hypertension is usually defined as blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, or both, and proteinuria is defined as at least 0.3 g protein in a 24-hour collection, or 30 mg/dL or more (1+ on dipstick) in a random urine sample (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). An important issue in classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is the ability to differentiate hypertensive disorders present before pregnancy from those that are pregnancy-specific, of which the more ominous is pre-eclampsia. The impact of the two groups of conditions on the mother and fetus is different, as is their management.</P>
<P>About a quarter of the cases of hypertension during pregnancy are due to chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Lindheimer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindheimer 1999</LINK>). Women with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension often have uneventful pregnancies, but nearly 20% of women with chronic hypertension develop superimposed pre-eclampsia; development of pre-eclampsia or severe hypertension is responsible for most of the morbidity in these pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Sibai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 1998</LINK>). Pre-eclampsia, either presenting 'de novo' or superimposed on chronic hypertension or renal disease is the disorder most likely to endanger both mother and fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Lindheimer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindheimer 1999</LINK>). The cardinal features of pre-eclampsia are hypertension and proteinuria, but women may also have abnormalities of liver function or coagulation, or both, thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) or eclampsia (the rare occurrence of seizures superimposed on pre-eclampsia). Potential consequences for the fetus are intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, or death. For women with gestational hypertension the outcome is usually good, although hypertension frequently recurs in subsequent pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Chesley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesley 1978</LINK>). </P>
<P>The potential worsening from mild/moderate to severe disease and the difficulty in distinguishing between pre-eclampsia, chronic, secondary and gestational hypertension, and combinations of these entities gives strong support for close supervision of all hypertensive pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saudan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saudan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Systolic blood pressure has been demonstrated to be higher in ambulating women, which is the logic behind the use of bed rest for hypertension during pregnancy. Bed rest, either in hospital or at home, has a long history in the treatment of mild pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and has drawn the attention of different authors. Since 1952, when Hamlin reported the virtual disappearance of eclampsia with a policy of vigorous antenatal education and supervision (including early admission to hospital and numerous interventions besides bed rest) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamlin-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamlin 1952</LINK>), the notion that bed rest might improve the outcome of hypertensive pregnancies became engrained in the mind of practitioners and health service planners. Hospitalisation was then strongly recommended, not only for closer supervision to monitor the mother and fetus for signs of deterioration, but also for bed rest. Thus, hospitalisation to enhance compliance with bed rest became a common practice for decades. It is not known whether bed rest is beneficial, regardless of whether combined with hospitalisation. Over the last ten years, domiciliary or day care facilities have been used in Europe to monitor pregnancies with hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia, thus avoiding hospitalisation. However, use of such facilities appears to occur infrequently in many other settings, especially in developing countries.</P>
<P>The extent to which bed rest is prescribed in pregnancy is difficult to determine, either in hospital or in outpatient clinics, as it is not clear whether the advice to rest in bed is recorded as frequently as it is advised (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1994</LINK>). Using the 1988 US National Infant Mortality Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 1991</LINK>) Goldenberg et al found that 4.8% of pregnant women were advised by their physicians to rest in bed for at least one week because of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1994</LINK>). This represents nearly 200,000 women of the four million annual United States births. A great number of women also reduce their work load or stop working. This could be stressful for the woman and disruptive for her family (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maloni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maloni 1993</LINK>), and could also have important consequences in terms of costs for both the families and the health services. </P>
<P>Even though, for most women with hypertension, the period of bed rest is likely to be relatively short, concerns about its safety have been raised. There may be an increase in the likelihood of adverse events such as thrombosis, muscle atrophy, bone demineralisation and calcium depletion (<LINK REF="REF-Maloni-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maloni 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Bed rest has been prescribed both as a primary therapy, and as an adjunct to other treatments for hypertension during pregnancy, such as antihypertensive drugs. There is a need to evaluate bed rest, in hospital or at home, to determine whether its use improves pregnancy outcome sufficiently to warrant such a recommendation. If bed rest is found to be clearly effective in improving outcome, then the costs, disruptions in normal living and maternal stress should be evaluated further in risk and cost-benefit analyses. </P>
<P>A number of other interventions for women with hypertension during pregnancy are covered by other Cochrane reviews. These include salt restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2005</LINK>), antiplatelet agents (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2007</LINK>), abdominal decompression (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1996</LINK>), antihypertensive drug treatments for mild to moderate hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>), and drug regimens for severe hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>). There is also a separate review assessing the effect of oral beta blockers in mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the relative benefits, risks, and side-effects for the woman and baby of different degrees of bed rest compared with each other or with routine activity, with or without hospitalisation, as a primary therapy for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. If bed rest is beneficial overall, a secondary aim was to assess the comparative effects of bed rest in hospital and at home.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Assessment of the trials for inclusion was performed independently by two authors. Authors were not blinded to the authors, source of the articles, and results. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study quality</HEADING>
<P>Methodological quality was assessed with the following criteria.<BR/>(1) How selection bias at entry to the trial was avoided: how the random assignment was generated and how allocation concealment was ensured. A quality score for concealment of allocation was assigned to each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation such as open random-number tables, sealed envelopes that are not numbered and opaque.</P>
<P>Trials with quasi-random design were excluded.</P>
<P>(2) How selection bias after entry to the trial was avoided: what was the withdrawal rate and whether the analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. For withdrawals, studies were classified as follows:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(C) more than 10% and up to 20% of participants excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>Trials were excluded if it was not possible to analyse data on an intention-to-treat basis or 20% or more participants were excluded, or both.</P>
<P>(3) How assessment bias was avoided: how the investigator, the participant or the person assessing the outcome, or both, was blinded to the allocated group. In case of no blinding at all, how objective was the endpoint measured. Blinding was assessed in the following way:<BR/>(a) blinding of participant (yes/no/unclear or not specified);<BR/>(b) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear or not specified);<BR/>(c) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear or not specified).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and entry</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two authors, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Data were entered onto the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), and checked for accuracy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>Statistical analyses were carried out using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). All outcomes were dichotomous data, so results are presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to assess heterogeneity between trials, where relevant. As significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%) was not detected, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>A prespecified subgroup was based on the type of hypertensive disease at trial entry: gestational hypertension; hypertension with proteinuria; and chronic hypertension. This analysis was not done because of the small numbers in the review. It will be included in future updates when sufficient data are available.</P>

<P>This review includes four small trials involving a total of 449 women. Two were conducted in Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>), one in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>), and one in Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>). Two were multicentre (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All participants were women with a singleton pregnancy, between 26 and 38 weeks' gestation at trial entry. Two trials recruited both primigravidae and multigravidae women (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>), and the other two did not report on parity.</P>
<P>The women had diastolic blood pressure between 90 to 110 mmHg. One trial also specified systolic pressure of at least 140 mmHg. Two studies included women with chronic or gestational hypertension without proteinuria (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>). The other two included women with unspecified proteinuric hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>). No trials reported on whether women were using antihypertensive therapy at trial entry, and only one reported on use of antihypertensives as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Definitions of outcomes used by trialists were consistent with those specified in this review.</P>
<P>One trial reported on women' s views of the intervention and satisfaction with care (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>). The other outcomes from this study have not been reported because more than 20% participants were excluded from analysis for all other outcomes.</P>
<P>No trials reported on side-effects of bed rest or costs to health care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies were excluded from the review. Four were excluded because all comparison groups had bed rest. Three of these studies compared an antihypertensive drug plus bed rest with bed rest alone (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catalano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1992</LINK>). The fourth was a three-arm study in which bed rest alone was compared with both compliance enhancement training and a bio-behavioural intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Somers-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1989</LINK>). Two studies were excluded because the participants were pregnant women with normal blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Herrera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinapolice-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Spinapolice 1983</LINK>). One trial was excluded because women were able to opt out of the trial after randomisation if they were not happy with the allocated treatment, and they were excluded from the analysis. Although the number of women who opted out is not known even after contacting trialists, it seems likely this was greater than 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1977</LINK>).</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>) excluded 13% of women from the analysis (equal in both groups). Reasons for exclusion included women not complying with their allocated treatment. The fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>), after recruiting women on a single reading of hypertension, excluded a large number of women (25.6%) mainly because blood pressure was no longer raised in these women after randomisation or because the women went into labour prior to confirmation of the diagnosis of hypertension (13 from bed rest group and 8 from control group). However, only 4.4% women were excluded from analysis for data on women's views of the intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>One trial stated that only the outcome assessor for fetal outcomes was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>). The other three trial reports did not mention blinding. Given the intervention under evaluation, blinding of the participants to this intervention is not possible. Although it would be possible to blind outcome assessment, it is unlikely that this was done because this would be quite a major undertaking, and it is reasonable to assume that it would have been reported had it been done.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Bed rest or restriction of normal activity either at home or in hospital have long been advocated for women with high blood pressure during pregnancy. Despite this, only four small adequately controlled trials have evaluated the potential effects of these interventions. The evidence available from these trials is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Two trials compared strict bed rest in hospital with some rest in hospital for pregnant women with proteinuric hypertension. We have no evidence that there is any difference in outcome between the two interventions. One trial was of good quality (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1986</LINK>), and the other was of uncertain quality (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1982</LINK>). The findings between trials were mostly consistent, except for perinatal mortality where the point effect of the good quality trial showed worse outcome with strict bed rest and the point effect of the other trial showed benefit from strict bed rest. However, the confidence intervals for both trials were wide and crossed the line of no effect for this outcome, implying that available evidence is insufficient, and the true answer may lie anywhere. <BR/> <BR/>Two trials compared some rest in hospital with routine activity at home for pregnant women with non-proteinuric hypertension, and were of good quality (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1998</LINK>). In one trial (218 women), there was a 42% reduction in the risk of severe hypertension for women who rested in hospital. This finding must be interpreted with caution, as the number of women in the trial was small, so results are more susceptible to the play of chance. The confidence interval is also wide, indicating that the true effect may be anywhere between an 11% reduction in risk to a 62% reduction. Women allocated routine activity at home were monitored with weekly blood pressure measurements in antenatal clinics. It is not reported whether the diagnosis of severe hypertension was based on persistent elevation of blood pressure, or a single episode, and whether antihypertensive medication was required. The clinical significance of this outcome is therefore unclear. It may, at least in part, be related to 'white coat hypertension', where the stress of coming to a hospital leads to transient elevation in blood pressure. This same trial also showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.99) for women with some bed rest in hospital. However, there was no apparent effect on very preterm birth. As above, the numbers are small, and the confidence interval is wide. It is therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the possible differential effects on preterm birth. While statistically significant results are present in this review, they need to be confirmed, and then clinically significant benefits still need to be demonstrated.</P>
<P>Questions remain about the quantification of rest and activity in the trials. We have made an attempt to quantify 'rest' by dividing it into 'strict' and 'some' based on definitions used by trialists, but the hours of bed rest each day are not reported. Standardising definitions for 'routine' or unrestricted activity is even more difficult. One woman's routine activity may be strenuous work all day, whereas another woman's routine activity may be light work with frequent restful breaks. Although it can be difficult to address these issues in trials, better descriptions of what constitutes rest and baseline level of activity would add to the validity and applicability of results obtained from this review.</P>
<P>The potential effects of bed rest may be related to the type of hypertensive disease a woman has. Although the effects of bed rest on women with proteinuric hypertension (first comparison) are unclear, women with non-proteinuric hypertension (second comparison) seemed to benefit from some rest, with a reduced risk of severe hypertension. Further trials are needed to assess the influence of type of hypertensive disease on effects of bed rest. </P>
<P>All three trials evaluated the effects of bed rest in hospital. It is arguable whether this rest is actually 'restful' for all women, or does the added stress of hospitalisation in certain women undermine any benefits of the prescribed bed rest. Although no trials specifically reported on women's views of bed rest with regards to the disruption to their lives, or stress associated with hospitalisation, in one trial, less women in the bed rest group opted to have the same treatment in future pregnancies, possibly as a result of these factors. </P>
<P>Bed rest in hospital or at home has financial implication for women and their families, and for healthcare services, but included trials did not report on these costs. </P>
<P>Prolonged bed rest may be associated with complications such as thrombosis, muscle atrophy or bone demineralization. Bed rest may be prescribed for a variable duration in pregnancy, but it is likely that the risk of adverse effects would be higher with lengthier periods of immobility. However, included trials did not report on adverse effects. Greater awareness of the hazards of prolonged periods of immobility may well make interventions such as strict bed rest obsolete for hypertension in pregnancy. What merits further evaluation is whether some rest or restriction of activity, either at home or in hospital, is beneficial.</P>
<P>Bed rest in hospital allows increased surveillance of the woman, and it is proposed that timely access to medical care in hospital may improve pregnancy outcome. At present we have little evidence to support or refute this argument, but if such benefits do exist, they must be weighed against the numbers needed to treat to avert any adverse outcome. On the other hand, being in hospital may predispose to detection bias, and provoke a more interventionalist approach. Moreover, where increased surveillance is required, day care units, where available, are now becoming widely recognised as alternatives to hospital admission for management of complicated pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Kr_x00f6_ner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kröner 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Given the paucity of trials, and the absence of relevant and important information from available trials, no reliable conclusions can be made from this review to guide clinical practice regarding bed rest for management of women with hypertension in pregnancy. No conclusive, clinically significant benefits of bed rest have been demonstrated, the possibility of adverse effects remains, and women appear to prefer normal activity and outpatient care in comparison to bed rest with hospitalisation as a care plan.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Women with hypertension in pregnancy are often advised to rest in bed, either at home or in the hospital, to prevent progression of hypertension and improve pregnancy outcome. This intervention has been evaluated in few well-controlled trials, and there is insufficient evidence to provide clear guidance for clinical practice. Although one small trial suggests that some bed rest may be associated with a reduced risk of severe hypertension and preterm birth, these findings need to be confirmed in other larger trials. Moreover, it appears that more women prefer outpatient management with unrestricted activity in comparison to hospitalisation and bed rest if the choice were given. Evidence currently available from randomised trials does not support routine recommendation of bed rest for hypertension in pregnancy.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large well-controlled randomised trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of rest in hospital and at home for women with proteinuric and non-proteinuric hypertension in pregnancy. Trials need to report not only on pregnancy outcome, but also on the potential side-effects of bed rest, women's views of the intervention and the costs involved, as these factors are also important determinants in formulating recommendations for clinical practice.</P>

<P>The original published protocol was updated while drafting the 2007 updated review. The differences include:<BR/>(1) a new contact author (S Meher) and additional sources of support were added.<BR/>(2) the 'Objectives' were reworded and additional comparisons were included. This was done to accommodate for variation of definitions of 'bed rest' and 'normal activity' used by trialists. One trialist's bed rest in hospital (rest in bed but allowed to move around the ward) was another trialist's normal activity in hospital (this trialist defined bed rest as strict bed rest where the participant only got up to go to the toilet). To avoid pooling interventions which crossed arms in different trials, we divided bed rest into different degrees and created new comparisons of different degrees of bed rest. Moreover, the original protocol did not allow for comparisons of bed rest and normal activity across different settings in the same trial, for example, bed rest in hospital versus normal activity at home. We felt that these were important comparisons that needed to be included in the review.</P>
