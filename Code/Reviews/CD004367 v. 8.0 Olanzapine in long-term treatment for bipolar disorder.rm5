<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 13:51:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar affective disorder is a severe and common mental illness, characterised by periods of mania, depression and "mixed episodes" (or "dysphoric mania": a mixture of manic and depressed symptoms). Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat acute manic episodes and one commonly used antipsychotic drug that has recently been approved for use in mania in USA and Europe is olanzapine. This review considered the efficacy, acceptability and adverse effects of olanzapine in long-term treatment of bipolar disorder in comparison with placebo or other active drug comparisons. Five trials (1165 participants) met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Based on a limited amount of information, olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes (especially manic relapse) in patients who responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. The olanzapine group had significantly fewer patients suffering from insomnia than the placebo group, but a significantly larger number of people suffering from weight gain. When compared with lithium, olanzapine caused more weight gain and depressive symptoms but fewer insomnia and nausea symptoms and a lower rate of manic worsening. However, considering the lack of clear findings of this review, conclusions on efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine compared to placebo, lithium or valproate cannot be made with any degree of confidence</P>

<P>Five trials (1165 participants) were included in the review. There was no statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo (either alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) in terms of number of participants who experienced relapse into mood episode (random effects RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, p = 0.09; 2 studies, n=460), however restricting the analysis to the trial that compared olanzapine monotherapy versus placebo, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of olanzapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69, p&lt;0.00001). No statistically significant difference was found between olanzapine and other mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate) in preventing symptomatic relapse for any mood episode, however, olanzapine was more effective than lithium in preventing symptomatic manic relapse (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, p = 0.01; 1 study, n=361). Olanzapine either alone or as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers was associated with significantly greater weight gain than placebo. By contrast, olanzapine was associated with a lower rate of manic worsening, but with a higher rate of weight increase and depression than lithium.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 21:19:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Though based on a limited amount of information, there is evidence that olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes in patients who have responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 08:11:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bipolar affective disorder is a severe and common mental illness with a life-time prevalence of 0.5% to 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1997</LINK>). Bipolar disorder is characterised by periods of mania (termed hypomania when manic symptoms are not sufficiently severe to cause pronounced impairment in social or occupational functioning), depression and "mixed episodes" (or "dysphoric mania": a mixture of manic and depressed symptoms) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). It is equally common in women and men and is strongly familial (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nurnberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurnberg 1992</LINK>). Most patients experience multiple episodes, with an average of 0.4 to 0.7 episodes per year, each lasting three to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Angst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angst 2000</LINK>). Bipolar disorder is one of the top thirty causes of worldwide disability, due to its chronic and recurrent nature (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 08:22:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently there have been advances in the treatment of the acute and depressive phases of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-McElroy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 2000</LINK>); but bipolar disorder remains associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Angst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angst 2002</LINK>), with a particularly high rate of suicide attempts and completed suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1997</LINK>) and substantial comorbidity with anxiety and drug abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2002</LINK>). Many patients require long-term treatment to prevent recurrence and to reduce the loss of productivity and increased medical costs associated with this illness (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1999</LINK>). An effective long-term treatment should also improve interpersonal, social and vocational functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Abood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keck--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 2002</LINK>). There are variations in clinical practice between Europe and US that arise from the uncertainty about which drugs are most effective and well tolerated and whether combination treatments are better than monotherapy. Lithium reduces the rate of manic relapse by about 40%, and the rate of depressive relapse by about a quarter. Many patients, however, are not helped by lithium and it also has troublesome adverse events and a narrow therapeutic index (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2002</LINK>), which reduce its acceptability (<LINK REF="REF-Suppes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suppes 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>). Valproic acid is well tolerated and effective in acute mania (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2002</LINK>), but there is less evidence about valproate in maintenance or how it compares to lithium (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 2000</LINK>). Combination of these drugs could be recommended and utilized for patients who have not responded to monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Frances-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frances 1998</LINK>). Other drugs include carbamazepine and newer antiepileptics (lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate and zonisamide) and the atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone amisulpiride, sertindole, aripiprazole and ziprasidone) (<LINK REF="REF-McElroy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 2000</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-10-28 13:35:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat acute manic episodes and, although the practice is not usually recommended, many patients are prescribed these drugs long-term. One commonly used antipsychotic drug that has recently been approved for use in mania in USA and Europe is olanzapine. Although there is some evidence that olanzapine is effective in the treatment of acute mania, it is less clear how effective and safe it is in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Rendell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rendell 2004</LINK>). In long-term treatments, the adverse effects of a drug become especially important because patients may find them less acceptable than in short-term treatment. Weight gain is frequently cited as a adverse event of olanzapine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Allison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allison 1999</LINK>) and hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic non-ketonic coma have also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bettinger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bettinger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roefaro-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roefaro 2001</LINK>). Other common olanzapine adverse events are somnolence, agitation, dizziness and asthenia; less frequent effects are constipation, dry mouth, rhinitis and hepatic enzyme elevations (<LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 1999</LINK>).In schizophrenia olanzapine is normally associated with a lower risk of extrapyramidal adverse events than traditional antipsychotics; however recent papers reported tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia following olanzapine treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Esel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esel 2000</LINK>), induced manic and depressive states in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lykouras-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lykouras 2001</LINK>), serotonin syndrome, when combining with other drugs with known serotoninergic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Haslett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslett 2002</LINK>), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Philibert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philibert 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the five included RCTs, four studies were maintenance trials in which long-term treatment was instituted specifically to prevent further episodes of illness. Of these four studies, three had a discontinuation design (with a second randomisation between acute and maintenance phase), with patients re-randomised before the double-blind phase of long-term treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2006</LINK>). The fourth maintenance study enrolled bipolar patients when euthymic (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK>). By contrast, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>) was a continuation trial: in this study, patients were randomised only before the first phase of acute treatment, after which they entered an extension period remaining in the same treatment group. Given the difference in design between maintenance and continuation studies, the current review reports on the results produced by the two different methodological approaches separately.</P>

<I>Maintenance trials</I>
<BR/>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2006</LINK>) included bipolar disorder patients with symptomatic remission after open-label acute treatment for 6-12 weeks with olanzapine for an index manic or mixed episode. Beginning with week 6 (and no later than week 12), patients in symptomatic remission for at least two consecutive weekly visits became eligible for randomization to the maintenance phase. To minimise the number of patients receiving placebo, patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind maintenance treatment with either 5-20 mg/day of olanzapine or placebo for 48 weeks. Of 910 patients who entered screening, 731 received open-label olanzapine as acute therapy. During open-label treatment, 361 (49.4%) met symptomatic remission criteria and were randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine (N=225) or placebo (N=136).</P>
<P>The second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK>) enrolled men and women aged 18-70 years who had achieved syndromic remission from an index manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder after receiving open-label lithium or valproate plus additional olanzapine under double-blind conditions during a 6-week period (<LINK REF="REF-Tohen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tohen 2002</LINK>). Patients who received combination treatment during the acute phase and had achieved syndromic remission of both mania and depression as defined above were randomly reassigned to receive an additional 18 months of double-masked therapy, consisting of either olanzapine (flexible dosage range of 5 to 20 mg per day) in combination with lithium or valproate (combination therapy), or placebo added to lithium or valproate (monotherapy). Patients continued taking the same mood stabiliser that they had received during the acute phase. Of the 160 patients who were assessed for eligibility, 99 patients who had received olanzapine combined with either lithium or valproate during the acute phase achieved remission of bipolar disorder and were reassigned randomly either to continue with double-blind combination therapy (olanzapine plus either lithium or valproate, n=51) or to discontinue olanzapine and receive placebo added to lithium or valproate (monotherapy, n=48).<BR/>
<BR/>The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK>) was a study consisting of three study periods, after the screening visits: (i) open-label co-treatment with olanzapine, 15 mg/ day, and lithium, 600 mg/day (6 to 12 weeks); (ii) double-blind tapering phase (4 weeks), and (iii) double-blind monotherapy (48 weeks). Patients who met symptomatic remission criteria during the open-label co-treatment period were randomly reassigned in a 1:1 ratio to monotherapy with either olanzapine or lithium. A total of 543 patients were enrolled during the open-label period and received lithium/olanzapine co-treatment. Of those, 431 (79.4%) achieved symptomatic remission criteria during the open-label period and were randomly assigned to double-blind maintenance monotherapy with olanzapine (N=217) or lithium (N=214).</P>
<P>The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK>) included patients with a diagnosis of bipolar (type I or II) or schizoaffective disorder, euthymic at the moment of recruitment, but authors gave no information about study design in the publication report. Relapse was defined as a patient fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for a major mood episode (depressive, manic, or mixed).<BR/>

<I>Continuation trial</I>
<BR/>In this study (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>), 251 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar mania (YMRS baseline total score &#8805;20) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either olanzapine (5-20 mg/day; N=125) or divalproex sodium (500-2500 mg/day, recommended therapeutic serum level of 50-125 &#956;g/ml; N=126) for a 3-week period.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2006</LINK> all patients met the DSM-IV criteria for an index manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder and were required to have a YMRS total score &#8805;20 at screening and at the start of 6- to 12-week open-label acute treatment. In addition, the patients were required to have experienced at least two prior manic or mixed episodes within 6 years of study entry. Beginning with week 6 (and no later than week 12), patients in symptomatic remission for at least two consecutive visits became eligible for randomization to the maintenance phase. In this trial, rapid cycling patients were included: 119 (52.9%) patients in the olanzapine group and 60 (44.1%) in the placebo group; results were stratified according to this sub-group in a post-hoc analysis.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK> all patients had been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode, with or without psychotic features. Prior to enrolment in the acute phase, participants had to have experienced at least two previous mood episodes (depressed, manic or mixed). They were also required to have had a documented trial at a therapeutic blood level of lithium (0.6-1.2 mmol/l) or valproate (50-125 mg/ml) for at least 2 weeks immediately prior to enrolment and to have demonstrated persistent manic symptoms, as defined from a YMRS total score of 16 or more at both enrolment and randomisation. Patients who achieved remission with the combination therapy of olanzapine plus lithium or valproate were randomly reassigned to receive an additional 18 months of double-masked therapy (olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate [combination therapy] versus placebo added to lithium or valproate [monotherapy]). Patients continued taking the same mood stabiliser that they had received during the acute phase, the choice of which was determined by the site investigator. In this trial, rapid cycling patients were included: 22 (43.1%) patients in the olanzapine combination group and 19 (39.6%) in the lithium/valproate monotherapy one; however, results were not stratified according to this sub-group.</P>
<P>All patients enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK> met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (current episode manic or mixed), with a baseline YMRS total score &#8805;20 and a history of at least two manic or mixed episodes in the preceding six years. Patients who met symptomatic remission criteria during the open-label cotreatment period were randomly reassigned to monotherapy with either olanzapine or lithium. In this trial, rapid cycling patients were included: 6 (2.3 %) patients in the olanzapine group and 7 (3.3 %) in the lithium one; however results were not stratified according to this sub-group.</P>

<I>Maintenance trials</I>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2006</LINK>, after patients received the initial double-blind dose for 1 day, the daily dose could be adjusted by one tablet per day within the allowed dose range of one to four tablets (5-20 mg/day). Benzodiazepine use was permitted during the double-blind phase but could not exceed 4 mg/day of lorazepam equivalents during the first week and could not exceed 2 mg/day of lorazepam equivalents during the remainder of the study period. Anticholinergic use was permitted. The mean daily doses of olanzapine were 11.8 mg in the open-label acute treatment phase and 12.5 mg in the double-blind maintenance phase.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK>, patients in the combination therapy group began treatment with 10mg per day of olanzapine. Patients unable to tolerate the minimum dose (one capsule of 5 mg) were withdrawn from the study. During this relapse prevention phase of the study, the blood levels of lithium and valproate remained within the therapeutic range as in the acute phase (lithium 0.6-1.2 mmol/l, valproate 50-125 mg/ml). If lithium or valproate levels deviated from this therapeutic range, the investigator adjusted the dosage of either drug to re-establish blood levels within the range. Patients were permitted adjunctive use of benzodiazepines (&#8804;2mg lorazepam equivalent per day) for no more than 5 consecutive days, or 60 days cumulatively. Anticholinergic therapy (benzatropine mesylate &#8804;2mg per day) was permitted throughout the study for treatment of extrapyramidal side-effects but not for prophylaxis. Aside from study drugs, benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, no other psychiatric drug was permitted during the study. In patients receiving olanzapine plus lithium or valproate (combination therapy) the modal daily dose of olanzapine was 8.6 mg. In the combination therapy group, the mean daily dose of lithium was 1064.6 mg with a blood level of 0.76 mmol/l and for valproate was 1264.6 mg with a blood level of 67.8 mg/ml. In the monotherapy group, the mean daily dose of lithium was 1023.8 mg with a blood level of 0.74 mmol/l and for valproate was 1286.5 mg with a blood level of 66.3 mg/ml.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK>, eligible patients began open-label cotreatment with olanzapine, 15 mg/day, and lithium, 600 mg/day. Allowed dosages of olanzapine were 5-20 mg/day. Investigators were required to optimize lithium dose and reach a target blood level of 0.6-1.2 meq/liter by week 4 during this period. During the double-blind taper period, patients remained on their current dose of randomly assigned treatment, and the dose of the discontinued drug was tapered over 4 weeks. Lithium levels were monitored every 2 weeks during the double-blind taper period and monthly during double-blind maintenance monotherapy. If the serum level of lithium deviated from the therapeutic range during these study periods, the investigator was to adjust the dose of lithium to reestablish blood levels within the therapeutic range, with a goal of reaching this range within 30 days. Serum levels ranging from 0.6-1.2 meq/liter were considered within normal limits. The mean doses of olanzapine and lithium, respectively, during the open-label period were 13.5 mg and 1003.3 mg (mean serum level=0.697 meq/liter). For the double-blind period, the mean dose was 11.9 mg for olanzapine and 1102.7 mg for lithium (mean serum level=0.76 meq/liter). Oral or intramuscular haloperidol and zuclopenthixol were permitted for extreme agitation during the open-label period. Benzodiazepines were allowed. The maximum dose from the screening period through the first 6 weeks of the open-label cotreatment period was 8 mg/day in lorazepam equivalents and 6 mg/day in lorazepam equivalents for the remainder of the open-label period and during the first 2 weeks of the taper period. It was further decreased to 4 mg/day for the remaining 2 weeks of the taper period and then to 2 mg/day (for not more than 60 cumulative days) for the double-blind monotherapy period. Patients were permitted concomitant medication for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (biperiden or benztropine mesylate up to 6 mg/day; trihexyphenidyl up to 12 mg/day). Prophylactic use of anticholinergics for extrapyramidal symptoms was not allowed in this trial.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK>, olanzapine and valproate doses were adjusted according to the clinical needs. The final mean dosage was 9 mg for olanzapine and 415 mg for valproate. At the end of the study, the mean valproate plasma level was 62.7 &#956;g/mL.

<I>Continuation trial<BR/>
</I>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>, the initial dose of olanzapine was 15 mg/day, and for divalproex it was 750 mg/day. The investigators made dose adjustments. Patients who did not tolerate the minimum treatment dose (5 mg/day of olanzapine or 500 mg/day of divalproex) were removed from the study. Serum concentrations were measured to evaluate whether divalproex trough levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50 to 125 &#956;g/ml. Concomitant lorazepam was allowed throughout the 47 weeks, but use was restricted to a maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and it was not allowed within 8 hours of the administration of a symptom rating scale. Benztropine was permitted to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, up to a maximum of 6 mg/day. Prophylactic use of anticholinergics for extrapyramidal symptoms was not allowed in this trial. The mean modal dose for the olanzapine-treated patients was 16.2 mg/day, and the mean modal dose for the divalproex-treated patients was 1584.7 mg/day. The mean valproate blood levels after 3 weeks of treatment was 83.9 &#956;g/ml, after 7 weeks was72.5 &#956;g/ml, after 11 weeks was 64.1 &#956;g/ml, and after 47 weeks was 58.2 &#956;g/ml.

<I>Maintenance trials</I>
<BR/>All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Altamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Altamura 2004</LINK> were reported to have been double-blind.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2006</LINK>, the double-blind maintenance phase was preceded by an 6-12 week open-label study with olanzapine monotherapy.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK>, mood stabiliser therapy was not masked in either the maintenance or acute phase; only the addition of olanzapine or placebo was conducted under double-masked conditions, however, trial authors did not report whether the blind treatment for the acute phase was revealed prior to the long-term phase. To maintain masking in this trial, treatment took the form of two 5mg (either olanzapine or placebo), titrated up in increments of one capsule, or down by any number of decrements at the investigator's discretion, as indicated by each patient's symptom improvement and treatment tolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK>, during the double-blind taper period, patients remained on their current dose of randomly assigned treatment, and the dose of the discontinued drug was tapered in a blinded, a priori-determined, stepwise manner over four weeks. To maintain the blind associated with blood draws, all patients randomly assigned to olanzapine also had blood drawn. For every outlier report generated for a lithium patient, a sham lithium outlier report was sent to an olanzapine patient. Consequently, reports to investigative sites indicating that the lithium dose should be adjusted did not unmask the randomised assignment.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Continuation trial</I>
<BR/>In this study (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>), all investigators at the clinical sites and at Lilly Research Laboratories were kept blinded to treatment assignment. To maintain the blind, blood was also drawn from all subjects randomly assigned to olanzapine, and sham "divalproex" results were reported. The samples were shipped to an independent reference laboratory; a coordinator at the reference laboratory was unblinded to treatment assignment. If a serum level was found to be above or below the therapeutic range, the divalproex dose was modified accordingly such that the serum level was brought back to the therapeutic range within 30 days. For each report of a serum level out of the target range that was sent for a divalproex-treated patient, a similar sham out-of-target-range report for divalproex was sent for a randomly selected olanzapine-treated patient at a different investigative site.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 21:53:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our analysis, we used the number of patients withdrawing from treatment because of recurrence during the study as the primary outcome. We found a statistically significant benefit for olanzapine compared to placebo and lithium in preventing only manic relapse; however, the study comparing olanzapine with lithium (a 52-week trial), notwithstanding its large sample size (431 patients), is probably rather short for a true maintenance study in a disorder where treatment is typically continued for many years. We did not find evidence that olanzapine is superior to lithium or placebo in preventing either bipolar relapse (both manic and depressive episodes) or depressive relapse. Olanzapine and lithium had different side-effect profiles: there were numerically less adverse events in olanzapine-treated patients, but comparatively high lithium levels were used in the trial and these levels were higher in the following double-blind monotherapy study phase than in the beginning combination therapy phase. In all the trials weight gain was significantly greater in the olanzapine group, even if the same authors used different cut-off values to define potentially clinically significant change in weight: more than 7% change from baseline in the olanzapine-lithium trial and more than 10% change from baseline in the olanzapine-placebo trial. This evidence is consistent with observational evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>), and strengthened by considering that olanzapine-related weight gain increases according to a plateau-shaped pattern and that the final weight gain changes have been referred considering as a baseline the re-randomisation phase, that is, 6-12 weeks after the real first randomisation to olanzapine.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 22:03:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results obtained in this review could be biased owing to the very high overall dropout rate, which could undermine the reliability and clinical interpretation of findings. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients' and their relatives' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. When comparing olanzapine versus placebo alone, it should be borne in mind that the design of the study again has some important implications. This was a placebo-controlled maintenance trial and patients and their clinicians may have been reluctant to accept the risk of assignment to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Ellenberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellenberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temple-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 2000</LINK>). Consequently, generalisability of these findings can only be extended to patients who are likely to be enrolled in a randomised placebo-controlled study.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 22:22:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main concern is that of the five trials included in this review, four were undertaken by the manufacturer of the testing intervention. This means that 80% of included RCTs and more than 97.5% of randomised patients were recruited by an industry sponsor. Careful attention should be paid when interpreting results because of the risk of sponsorship bias (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2006</LINK>). First, the maintenance phase of these studies tested an enriched sample, randomising only those manic patients who responded acutely to olanzapine therapy (either as monotherapy or as co-therapy) (see Characteristics of included studies table). Second, many patients randomised in the included studies were likely to be resistant to the other mood stabilisers under investigations (lithium or valproate), because similar enrichment designs were used in trials comparing olanzapine with other active comparators. In the trial comparing olanzapine with lithium (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2005</LINK>) it is likely that patients with a higher probability to be olanzapine responder, story of intolerance, or lack of response to an adequate trial of lithium were recruited. In this trial, patients were to be excluded from the study if they had a history of intolerance or lack of response to an adequate trial of one of the two investigational drugs, as determined by the investigators. However, in the manuscript it is reported that, "although a documented history of intolerance or lack of response to an adequate trial of olanzapine or lithium was an exclusion criterion, 206 such patients entered the study on lithium regimens. One hundred sixty-four were subsequently randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lithium (n=80) or olanzapine (n=84). Symptomatic recurrence criteria were met by 46.3% (n=37) of those given lithium and 34.5% (n=29) of those given olanzapine (p=0.152)...." This difference is not statistically significant, but could have clearly biased results in favour of olanzapine through selecting patients who were lithium-resistant. From the report, it appears that the exclusion criteria were not applied. We contacted study authors to request clarification, but did not receive a reply.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-12 20:09:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the use of olanzapine in treating patients with bipolar disorder is common, our search only located five RCTs (approximately one thousand patients) that investigated the efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine for long-term treatment in bipolar disorder, and for most outcomes only one or two studies contributed data. The small number of participants and events contributing to the assessment of each outcome may affect the robustness of the results.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-12 20:10:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Similar results were found in a Health Assessment Technology document, issued in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2007</LINK>), and also in a recent systematic review, conducted by the same review team (<LINK REF="REF-Beynon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beynon 2008</LINK>). Regarding deaths and suicide, the study comparing olanzapine with lithium failed to demonstrate any impact of lithium or olanzapine on suicide because, despite a relatively large sample size, there was only one suicide. This topic is of clear interest and has recently sparked an important debate in the scientific literature about the clinical use of lithium (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2007</LINK>). Evidence showing that lithium could reduce suicidal behaviour in patients with affective disorder is consistent, however because of the small number of events, new evidence with neutral or negative results could materially affect the estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 22:23:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering the lack of clear findings of this review and the limited amount of evidence, conclusions on efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine compared to placebo and lithium cannot be made with any degree of confidence, certainly outside of patients who have responded in the acute phase. Clinicians should always individualise the best maintenance drug treatment in each patient, according to the efficacy and tolerability of long-term treatments of documented efficacy. While there are positive results for olanzapine in preventing manic relapse, current evidence is stronger for lithium as first line maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and possibly also for lamotrigine and valproate (<LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2007</LINK>). The clinical bottom line is that there is some evidence that olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes in patients who responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-22 14:42:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for longer term and larger sample size RCTs, with clinically appropriate designs, preferentially conducted independent of the manufacturer, examining the relative efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine compared to other maintenance treatment drugs in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Analyses in the published papers should be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (www.consort-statement.org) and information about previous medication and tapering-off strategies should be also clearly reported (www.consort-statement.org). Adverse events should reflect patients' concerns and trial outcomes should include all other measures that are meaningful to real-life clinical decision making.</P>

<P>The 251 patients were ages 18&#8211;75 years and met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, as determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Version. A baseline total score of at least 20 on the Young Mania Rating Scale was required for study entry. Female patients of childbearing potential were required to use a medically accepted means of contraception. Any of the following was considered grounds for exclusion: serious and unstable medical illness; DSM-IV substance dependence within the past 30 days (except nicotine or caffeine); documented history of intolerance to olanzapine or divalproex; treatment with lithium, an anticonvulsant, or an antipsychotic medication within 24 hours of randomization; treatment with clozapine within 4 weeks of randomization; and serious suicidal risk.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-22 16:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial dose of olanzapine was 15 mg/day, and for divalproex it was 750 mg/day, consistent with the manufacturers&#8217; recommendations. The investigators made dose adjustments based primarily on clinical response but also on serum concentrations<BR/>and adverse events. Patients who did not tolerate the minimum treatment dose (5 mg/day of olanzapine or 500 mg/day of divalproex) were removed from the study.<BR/>Serum concentrations were measured to evaluate whether divalproex levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50&#8211;125 microg/ml. Divalproex concentrations below 35 microg/ml were reported as &#8220;well below target level,&#8221; those from 35 to 49 microg/ml were reported as &#8220;below target level,&#8221; those from 126 to 150 microg/ml were reported as &#8220;above target level,&#8221; and those above 150 microg/ml were reported as &#8220;well above target level.&#8221; If a serum level was found to be above or below the therapeutic range, the divalproex dose was modified accordingly such that the serum level was brought back to the therapeutic range within 30 days. For each report of a serum level out of the target range that was sent for a divalproex-treated patient, a similar sham out-of-target-range report for divalproex was sent for a randomly selected olanzapine-treated patient at a different investigative site. If the investigator decided to change the medication dose on the basis of the sham divalproex serum level for a patient taking olanzapine, the increase or decrease affected only the number of placebo tablets given to that patient. Concomitant lorazepam was allowed throughout the 47 weeks, but use was restricted to a maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and it was not allowed within 8 hours of the administration of a symptom rating scale. Benztropine was permitted to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, up to a maximum of 6 mg/day. Throughout the study,<BR/>benztropine was not allowed as prophylaxis for extrapyramidal symptoms. </P>

<P>Severity of symptoms was assessed with the 11-item Young Mania Rating Scale, the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the severity of illness rating from the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale for bipolar disorder, and the Positive<BR/>and Negative Syndrome Scale. Symptomatic remission of mania was defined as an<BR/>endpoint total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale of no more than 12.<BR/>Symptomatic remission of mania and depression was defined as an endpoint total mania score of no more than 12 and a Hamilton depression scale score of no more than 8. Syndromal remission of mania was defined on the basis of DSM-IV criteria as having no A criterion worse than mild in severity and no more than two B criteria rated as mild in severity. Syndromal remission of mania and depression was defined as the preceding mania criteria plus the following depression criteria: no DSM-IV A criteria for a major depressive episode that were worse than mild in severity and the presence of no more than three A criteria rated as mild. Symptomatic relapse into an affective episode (depression, mania, or mixed) was defined as a mania score of at least 15 or a depression score of at least 15 in a patient who previously met the criteria for symptomatic remission. Syndromal relapse into an affective episode<BR/>was defined as achievement of syndromal remission according to both mania and depression criteria followed by relapse into either mania or depression. Time to remission was determined on the basis of when the patient first met the criteria for remission. Time to relapse was computed by prospectively examining the<BR/>data for the patients who met the criteria for remission at week 3. Safety was monitored by assessing adverse events, laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, weight change, and extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus Rating Scale, Barnes Rating Scale for Drug-Induced Akathisia, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale). </P>

<P>Patients who received combination treatment during the acute phase and had achieved syndromic remission of both mania and depression as defined above were randomly reassigned at week 6 to receive an additional 18 months of double-masked therapy, consisting of either olanzapine (flexible dosage range of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15mg or 20mg per day) in combination with lithium or valproate (combination therapy), or placebo added to lithium or valproate (monotherapy). Patients continued taking the same mood stabiliser that they had received during the acute phase, the choice of which was determined by the site investigator. As in the acute phase, mood stabiliser therapy was not masked; only the addition of olanzapine or placebo was conducted under double-masked conditions. Patients in the combination therapy group began treatment with 10mg per day of olanzapine, given on the evening. The period between visits was 1 week for the first two assessments, 2 weeks for the next assessment, 4 weeks for the assessment after that, and 8 weeks for the remainder of the study. To maintain masking, treatment took the form of two 5mg capsules (either olanzapine or placebo), titrated up in increments of one capsule, or down by any number of decrements at the investigator&#8217;s discretion, as indicated by each patient&#8217;s symptom improvement and treatment tolerance. Patients unable to tolerate the minimum dose (one capsule) were withdrawn from the study. During this relapse prevention phase of the study, the blood levels of lithium and valproate remained within the therapeutic range (lithium 0.6&#8211;1.2 mmol/l, valproate 50&#8211;125 mg/ml), as previously defined. If lithium or valproate levels deviated from this therapeutic range, the investigator adjusted the dosage of either drug to re-establish blood levels within the range. Patients were permitted adjunctive use of benzodiazepines (maximum 2mg lorazepam equivalent per day) for no more than 5 consecutive days, or 60 days cumulatively. Anticholinergic therapy (benzatropine mesylate maximum 2mg per day) was permitted throughout the study for treatment of extrapyramidal side-effects but not for prophylaxis. Aside from study drugs, benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, no other psychiatric drug was permitted during the study.</P>

<P>Patients were recruited from 87 inpatient and outpatient settings across Western Europe, Canada, South Africa, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand between August 1999 and June 2002. 431 participants entered the double-blind phase (217 with olanzapine; 214 with lithium). Patients enrolled in this study were more than 18 years of age and met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (current episode manic or mixed) as determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Patient Version. Patients were required to have a Young Mania Rating Scale total score more than or equal to 20 at baseline and a history of at least two manic or mixed episodes in the preceding 6 years. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a serious, unstable medical illness; met DSM-IV substance dependence criteria (nicotine or caffeine excepted) within the past 30 days; had been treated with a depot neuroleptic within 6 weeks of random assignment; or were considered a serious suicide risk. Patients were also excluded if they had a history of intolerance, or lack of response, to an adequate trial of lithium or olanzapine as determined by the investigator.</P>

<P>Eligible patients began open-label cotreatment with olanzapine, 15 mg/day, and lithium, 600 mg/day. Allowed dosages of olanzapine were 5&#8211;20 mg/day. Investigators were required to optimize lithium dose and reach a target blood level of 0.6&#8211;1.2 meq/liter by week 4 during this period. Lithium levels were monitored every 2 weeks during the double-blind taper period and monthly during double-blind maintenance monotherapy. If the serum level of lithium deviated from the therapeutic range during these study periods, the investigator was to adjust the dose of lithium to reestablish blood levels within the therapeutic range, with a goal of reaching this range within 30 days. Serum levels ranging from 0.6&#8211;1.2 meq/liter were considered within normal limits. To maintain the blind associated with blood draws, all patients randomly assigned to olanzapine also had blood drawn. For every outlier report generated for a lithium patient, a sham lithium outlier report was sent to an olanzapine patient. Thus, reports to investigative sites indicating that the lithium dose should be adjusted did not unmask the randomized assignment. Rescue medication: patients who entered the study receiving psychotropic medications (including anticonvulsants, typical or atypical antipsychotics [oral or intramuscular], or antidepressants) were gradually discontinued from these medications at the discretion of the investigator during the first 3 weeks of the open-label cotreatment period. However, oral or intramuscular haloperidol and zuclopenthixol were permitted for extreme agitation during the open-label period. Benzodiazepines were allowed according to the following guidelines. The maximum dose from the screening<BR/>period through the first 6 weeks of the open-label cotreatment period was 8 mg/day in lorazepam equivalents and 6 mg/day in lorazepam equivalents for the remainder of the open-label period and during the first 2 weeks of the taper period. It was further decreased to 4 mg/day for the remaining 2 weeks of the taper period and then to 2 mg/day (for not more than 60 cumulative days) for the double-blind monotherapy period. Patients were permitted concomitant medication for treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (biperiden or benztropine mesylate, less than or equal to 6 mg/day; trihexyphenidyl, less than or equal to 12 mg/day). However, prophylactic use of anticholinergics for extrapyramidal symptoms was not allowed.</P>
