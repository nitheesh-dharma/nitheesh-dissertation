<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasms and swelling (inflammation). Bronchodilator drugs (reliever inhalers) can be used to relax the muscles and open the airways, and corticosteroid drugs to reduce the inflammation. Magnesium sulfate is a drug that can also affect muscles, and may reduce inflammation as well. It can be given through a drip in the veins (intravenously). The review of trials found that intravenous magnesium sulfate in addition to bronchodilators seems to be safe and beneficial for people with severe asthma attacks, or those for whom bronchodilators are not working.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and arresting airway inflammation. There is some evidence that intravenous magnesium can provide additional bronchodilation when given in conjunction with standard bronchodilating agents and corticosteroids. No systematic review of this literature has been completed on this topic.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effect of additional intravenous magnesium sulfate in patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma and were treated with IV magnesium sulfate versus placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Missing data were obtained from authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven trials were included (5 adult, 2 pediatric). A total of 665 patients were involved. Patients receiving magnesium sulfate demonstrated non-significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates when all studies were pooled (weighted mean difference: 29.4 L/min; 95% confidence interval: -3.4 to 62). In studies of people with severe acute asthma, peak expiratory flow rate improved by 52.3 L/min (95% confidence interval: 27 to 77.5). The forced expiratory volume in one second also improved by 9.8 % predicted (95% confidence interval: 3.8 to 15.8). Overall, admission to hospital was not reduced, odds ratio: 0.31 (95% confidence interval: 0.09 to 1.02). In the severe subgroup, admissions were reduced in those receiving magnesium sulfate (odds ratio: 0.10, 95% confidence interval: 0.04 to 0.27). No clinically important changes in vital signs or adverse side effects were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Current evidence does not support routine use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in all patients with acute asthma presenting to the emergency department. Magnesium sulfate appears to be safe and beneficial in patients who present with severe acute asthma.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:37:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:06:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Acute presentations to the emergency department (ED) are common and potentially serious complications of asthma. Approximately 10-25% of patients presenting to the ED will require admission to the hospital, however this rate varies depending on the age group studied, the treatments received (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>) and the setting. Treatment of acute asthma is based on pathophysiologic considerations including treatment of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Practice variation exists with respect to treatment approaches and this may be due in part to a lack of evidence-based summaries of the research pertinent to this field (<LINK REF="REF-Camargo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camargo 1998</LINK>). Generally, the initial treatment agents include beta-2 agonists which specifically target adrenergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Beveridge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beveridge 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>). Among children, quaternary agents administered in conjunction with beta-2 agonists have been shown to potentially increase the magnitude and duration of bronchodilation over that achieved with beta-2 agonists alone (Plotnik 1997). Additional treatment of oedema is usually initiated with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the need for rapid bronchodilation, there has been a wealth of research on the use of bronchodilators in the initial management of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1998</LINK>). However, the potential role of other agents in the initial management of acute asthma is still unclear. A meta-analysis of aminophylline performed a decade ago indicated no benefit in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Littenberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littenberg 1988</LINK>). On the other hand, steroids appear to reduce admissions to hospital and relapse following discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1992</LINK>). Significant debate exists with respect to the benefit of other agents such as magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma. Magnesium is an important cofactor in many enzymatic reactions and is linked to cellular homeostasis. In addition, magnesium has an effect on smooth muscle cells, with hypomagnesaemia causing contraction and hypermagnesaemia causing relaxation. There is some evidence that when magnesium is infused into asthmatic patients, it can provide additional bronchodilation (<LINK REF="STD-Okayama-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Okayama 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolla-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rolla 1988</LINK>). In addition, evidence suggests that magnesium may reduce the neutrophilic burst seen with the inflammatory response (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 1996</LINK>). Thus, there is reason to believe that magnesium treatment, in the form of intravenous magnesium sulfate, may be beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma.</P>
<P>This systematic overview examines evidence for the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium treatment in acute asthma. No systematic review of the magnesium sulfate literature has been published to date.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate in people with acute asthma treated in the emergency department. </P>
<P>Specific Aims</P>
<P>To quantify the effect of the combination of magnesium sulfate with other agents compared to the effect of these other agents alone. The specific outcomes include:<BR/>(1) Admissions (e.g. time to decision, % admission)<BR/>(2) Pulmonary functions <BR/>(3) Side effects and vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure (BP).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:07:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>To be considered, reported studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCT) or quasi RCTs (e.g. allocation on days of the week).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies including either children or adult patients presenting to an emergency department for treatment of acute asthma were considered for inclusion in the overview. Age was one of the sub-groups examined.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies reporting results of patients randomised to receive magnesium sulfate compared to placebo early in the emergency department treatment were included. Since acute asthmatics require additional treatments (e.g. beta-agonists, corticosteroids, ipratropium bromide, etc.) data for any co-interventions were recorded or requested from the authors when not reported in the studies.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:08:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, two reviewers (BR, JB) independently reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text, using specific criteria, two reviewers (CB, GB) independently selected trials for inclusion. Agreement was measured using kappa statistics. Disagreement was resolved by consensus or third party adjudication (BR).</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:08:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data for the trials were extracted by two reviewers (BR, JB). Primary study authors were requested to confirm data extraction and provide additional clarification and information for the review. Unfortunately, most authors could not access their original data to perform supplemental analyses. In some cases, expansion of graphic representations of data from the manuscripts were used to estimate missing data. Lung function data were entered as negative values to conform to the Cochrane convention whereby effects that favour the treatment under review move to the left.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:08:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Assessment of methodological quality: Methodological quality assessment was performed by two reviewers working independently. Both used two different methods of assessment. First, using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment, all trials were scored and entered using the following scale:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Uncertain<BR/>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment<BR/>Inter-rater reliability was measured by using simple agreement and kappa weighted statistics.</P>
<P>In addition, each study was assessed using a 0-5 scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and summarized as follows:<BR/>1) Was the study described as randomised (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>2) Was the study described as double-blind (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>3) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>4) Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>5) Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate (1=yes; 0=no)?<BR/>6) Deduct 1 point if methods for randomisation OR blinding were inappropriate.<BR/>Inter-rater reliability was measured by using kappa, and weighted kappa statistics.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:08:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Statistical considerations: All trials were combined using the Review Manager. Subgroup comparisons are identified in the Comparisons section. For dichotomous variables, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI); a random effects model was used. For continuous outcomes, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CIs using a random effects model.</P>

<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:09:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The initial search yielded 90 references of which 68 (76%) were identified as being original publications. Independent review of the abstracts and titles of these identified 8 potentially relevant studies. The simple agreement for relevance was 98% with a kappa of 0.76 (very good agreement). Additional references were sought from bibliographic searching of relevant articles and overviews (n=13), and from contact with authors (n=5), and one through journal searching. A total of 27 studies were reviewed for inclusion. Independent review of these potentially relevant articles resulted in 6 studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis; no relevant article was found from the journal search, bibliographic search or recommendations from authors. An updated search strategy was completed (Spring 1998) with the addition of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>). The review is considered updated to January of 1999.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:10:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The majority of studies were reported after 1989. Six were from centres in the United States; one was from India.</P>
<P>Populations: Two studies were conducted in children (<LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>) and five in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Skobeloff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skobeloff 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1996</LINK>). The populations varied from "all patients" with acute asthma (n = 2), to only those with severe attacks (n = 5). However, examination of the definitions used to designate the severe group (see below) reveals that patients had a combination of clinical findings, airflow measurements, and/or response to therapy that placed them in a more severe category.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">I. Severe subgroup:</HEADING>
<P>Bloch (sub-group only): FEV-1 &lt; 25% predicted after a single beta-2 agonist treatment. Admission rate in the placebo treated patients 79%.<BR/>Ciarallo: Children with PEFR &lt; 60% predicted following three beta-2 agonist nebuliser treatments. Admission in the placebo treated patients 100%.<BR/>Devi: Children with "severe" asthma AND a poor response to initial therapy (no airflow measurements). Admission rate in placebo treated patients 94%.<BR/>Skobeloff: Adults with initial PEFR &lt; 200 L/min AND did not double following two beta-2 agonists and &gt; 1 hour of treatment.

Unresponsiveness was defined as not improving to a point where discharge was possible. Admission rate in the placebo treated patients 18%.</P>
<P>The admission rate was not used a priori to classify the severity sub-group, but does lend some support to the use of this method of clinical categorisation of severity.

<P>Interventions: magnesium was administered early in the course of the emergency department treatment; two studies were within 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1996</LINK>), three were at approximately 1 hour (<LINK REF="STD-Skobeloff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skobeloff 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>) and one was unstated (<LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>). The route of administration was via the intravenous route in all studies and was administered as a bolus in all but one study where bolus +/- a continuous infusion was employed (<LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>). The dosage of intravenous magnesium sulfate delivery varied among studies however. All studies used a placebo of similar appearance. The dose in adults ranged from 1.2 gm to 2 gm IV and was generally administered over 20 minutes. In the pediatric studies, children received 25 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>) or 100 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>) (up to a maximum of 2 gm) IV over 20 minutes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes were determined at variable times but usually included admission to hospital/discharge assessment, and a variety of pulmonary function results. Short-term follow-up was provided in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1992</LINK>) and at 1 week (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>) to determine the rate of relapse to additional care. The variability of treatment approaches following discharge makes comparisons invalid. Side effects and vital signs were reported frequently enough to permit pooling.</P>

<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the included studies was rated as high. Many of the studies were double-blind, placebo controlled, demonstrated an appreciation of the need for concealment of allocation, and reported a sufficient number of outcomes. </P>
<P>Using the Jadad method, 6 studies were rated as "strong" (<LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skobeloff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skobeloff 1989</LINK>), and 1 was rated as "weak" (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1992</LINK>). A full manuscript was not available from one research group, so methodological quality was verified through author contact and review of the methods and results sections (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1996</LINK>). Using the Cochrane methodology: five studies were rated as having blinded allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>). It was unclear whether allocation was blinded in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Skobeloff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skobeloff 1989</LINK>), and in another study, allocation was clearly unblinded (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Tolerability</HEADING>
<P>Vital signs were recorded and reported in many of the included studies; pooled results did not demonstrate statistical or clinical heterogeneity. These results indicate that heart rate (WMD: 5.6 beats/minute; 95% CI: -1.5 to 12.7) and respiratory rates (WMD: -0.01 breaths/minute; 95% CI: -2.9 to 2.9) did not change with IV magnesium sulfate treatment. Systolic blood pressure was slightly decreased (WMD: -4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: -8.4 to -0.6). However, a change of this magnitude would not be considered clinically important. Overall, vital signs remained "stable" during the period immediately after administration of IV magnesium.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Side Effects</HEADING>
<P>Side effect monitoring was common in these studies, but few adverse events were reported. Magnesium appears to be a safe drug to administer to asthmatics in the acute state. Four trials reported no major side effects; minor side effects (burning at IV site, flushing, fatigue) were reported by 58% of patients in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>). Insufficient numbers of studies were available to provide meaningful sensitivity and sub-group comparisons or to draw firm conclusions about side effects and adverse events.</P>

<P>For pooled admission rates, children improve similarly to adults who have severe asthma (2 pediatric studies). Using a fixed effects model, the admission rate was lower in the magnesium sulfate treated patients (WMD: 0.54; 95% CI; 0.33 to 0.87), but significant heterogeneity remained. When the study of lowest quality was eliminated (<LINK REF="STD-Green-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Green 1992</LINK>), the pooled admission rate remained statistically lower for magnesium sulfate than placebo (WMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.25) and the heterogeneity was not significant (p &gt; 0.05).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review examined the use of IV magnesium sulfate in the emergency department management of acute asthma. The pooled results failed to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate in terms of admission rates or pulmonary functions. While the drug was well tolerated, the lack of effect argues against its indiscriminate use in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma.</P>
<P>This being said, there is evidence to suggest that a sub-group of patients experiencing a more severe asthma attack may respond differently to those with a less severe exacerbation. Patients who presented with severe asthma appeared to benefit from the use of IV magnesium sulfate, both in terms of pulmonary functions and admission rates. The clinical significance of the magnitude of the pulmonary function improvement is difficult to determine, since the minimally clinically important difference for lung function tests in acute asthma have not been determined. In chronic asthma an improvement of 12% predicted has been used (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>) and for acute studies, some have suggested an increase in PEFR of 30 L/min is clinically important (<LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>). The improvement of approximately 10% predicted FEV-1 or 50 L/min PEFR represent what we believe are important lung function test changes, especially considering the severity at the start of therapy. Moreover, these lung function test changes appear important enough to reduce admissions. </P>
<P>Severe asthma was defined differently across studies: <BR/>i. 25-30% predicted PEFR at presentation (adults)<BR/>ii. Failure to respond to initial treatments (adults and children),<BR/>iii. Failure to improve beyond 60% predicted after 1 hour of care (children). </P>
<P>A consistent marker of the severity was a failure to respond to initial beta-2 agonist treatment. For example, four studies in this review used this to define severity (<LINK REF="STD-Ciarallo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ciarallo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Devi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Devi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skobeloff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Skobeloff 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tiffany 1993</LINK>). This observation leads to the suggestion that a failure to respond to initial beta-2 agonist treatment may be an appropriate method of identifying those individuals who may benefit from magnesium sulfate treatment. </P>
<P>It is important to discuss the validity of subgroup analyses. Guidelines for subgroup analyses have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>), and should be considered within the context of this review. This meta-analysis used a sub-group based on baseline asthma severity which meets the above guidelines, given that it was an a priori decision and one which has been used in other Cochrane Airways Group reviews. In addition, the effect sizes were large, demonstrated no heterogeneity across five studies, and were physiologically reasonable. Furthermore, the subgroup results generated from both within (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 1995</LINK>) and between study comparisons were consistent.</P>
<P>Intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate was shown to be safe in those studies where vital signs and side effects were recorded. For example, magnesium sulfate treatment did not change pulse or respiratory rates; the minor change in systolic blood pressure was clinically insignificant. While this may seem counter-intuitive, we suggest that the poor reliability and validity of respiratory rate measurement might explain these findings. For example, in one large emergency department study, almost all of the respiratory rates were recorded as 20/minute (<LINK REF="REF-Camargo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camargo 1998</LINK>). When interpreting the safety and adverse reaction data, caution is advised since the total sample size of the pooled sample was insufficient to detect rare adverse events.</P>
<P>There is a possibility of publication bias in this meta-analysis. For example, by missing unpublished negative trials we may be over-estimating the effect of magnesium treatment. However, a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant studies was conducted, using a systematic strategy to avoid bias. This was followed by attempts to contact corresponding and first authors. One unpublished trial was identified and several negative trials were uncovered; however, we recognise that more of these types of trials may exist.</P>
<P>There is also a possibility of study selection bias. However, we employed two independent reviewers, and feel confident that the studies excluded were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons. Our search was comprehensive and has been updated, so it is unlikely that there are any trials in publication which were missed.</P>

<OL>
<LI>In this review, parenteral magnesium sulfate was provided as 2 gm IV over 20 minutes to adults and 25-100 mg/kg IV to children.</LI>
<LI>Many patients who present for assessment and treatment to the emergency department with an asthmatic exacerbation may not benefit from early treatment with magnesium sulfate.</LI>
<LI>Patients with severe acute asthma appear to benefit in terms of pulmonary function improvements and reduced admissions. In this context, severe asthma is defined as peak expiratory flow rates of less than 25-30% predicted after initial beta2-agonist therapy in adults and/or non-response to treatment (adults and children), or peak expiratory flow rates of less 60% predicted (children).</LI>
<LI>A clinical approach may be to identify candidates for magnesium sulfate therapy among those patients who do not respond to initial beta2-agonists treatment.</LI>
<LI>Two studies examined the use of magnesium in children. Given the similarity of the findings in children, it should have the same indications in the adult population. Only one study examined its use in children aged less than six, but the numbers were small.</LI>
<LI>In addition to any magnesium intervention, standard acute asthma therapy must be administered to these patients early in the emergency department treatment.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-06 17:25:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Many questions regarding the treatment of acute asthma with magnesium remain unanswered.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Most importantly, additional research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of therapy.</LI>
<LI>Additional studies are needed to confirm the sub-group findings from this review suggesting a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate only in severe acute asthma. In future studies, severity must be clearly defined and based on presenting pulmonary function results AND response to initial beta-agonist therapy whenever possible.</LI>
<LI>Studies involving very young children need to be performed to determine the effect of magnesium sulfate in this age group.</LI>
<LI>Further studies are required to examine the effect of magnesium sulfate based on the prior inhaled steroid use in patients presenting to the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation. The effect of treatment may differ based on inhaled steroid use, and the answer to this question remains unclear. Inhaled steroids are increasingly employed and the development of high dose inhaled steroids with lower systemic activity suggests that this would be an important area for future research.</LI>
<LI>Future research on acute asthma must concentrate on well defined outcomes which may lead to more informative reviews in the future. More specifically, criteria for discharge and reporting of lung function test data in a systematic fashion would assist in further work. Finally, better description of the methodology would also be beneficial.</LI>
