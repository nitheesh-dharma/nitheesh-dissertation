<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to compare the effectiveness of two commonly used painkillers, paracetamol and ibuprofen and the combination of both in a single tablet in the relief of pain following surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Worldwide the number of surgical operations to remove wisdom teeth is immense, in England alone approximately 63,000 are removed in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals each year. Many patients need time off work and their quality of life is significantly affected. However, despite these consequences, people are often most concerned about pain following the operation which can be severe. It is suggested that the most intense pain is felt three to five hours after surgery. The pain experienced after oral surgery is widely used as a model to measure the effectiveness of painkillers in general.</P>
<P>Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth. In 2010, a new painkiller (marketed as Nuromol) containing paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet was licensed for use in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>All the drugs studied in this review had minimal side effects noted when used correctly for short-term pain relief.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 20 May 2013. Seven studies with a total of 2241 participants all involving a direct comparison of ibuprofen to paracetamol or the combination of both were included in this review. All participants had surgery to remove a lower wisdom tooth or teeth that required bone removal or at least caused moderate to severe pain. Painkillers were taken after surgery and different doses of the drugs were compared.</P>
<P>The majority of the studies took place in the USA with one in Puerto Rico. Four of the trials took place in clinical research facilities, two in university dental hospitals and one in a private oral surgery clinic. The age of participants differed slightly between studies but was broadly similar, ranging from 15 to 65 years old. All studies included male and female participants.</P>
<P>All the studies included in this review looked only at pain relief and intensity information after a single dose of the painkiller after surgery. It is known that pain does continue after this and the drugs evaluated in this review are normally taken every six to eight hours (maximum of four times per day).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>Ibuprofen is more effective than paracetamol at all doses studied in this review. On limited evidence, the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol appeared to be no more effective than the single drugs when measured two hours after surgery. However, again on limited evidence, it was found to be more effective than the drugs taken singly when measured at six hours after surgery. Participants taking the combined drug also had a smaller chance of requiring rescue medication.</P>
<P>The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups. However, review authors could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All of the results (outcomes) comparing ibuprofen to paracetamol are of high quality. This means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimates of the effect.</P>
<P>When comparing combined versus single drugs, the body of evidence for the proportion of patients with &gt; 50% maximum pain relief (TOTPAR) over two and six hours, was assessed as of moderate quality due to imprecise estimates based on single studies. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The body of evidence for the use of rescue medication was assessed as being of high quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:33:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used analgesics for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth (third molars). In 2010, a novel analgesic (marketed as Nuromol) containing both paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet was launched in the United Kingdom, this drug has shown promising results to date and we have chosen to also compare the combined drug with the single drugs using this model. In this review we investigated the optimal doses of both paracetamol and ibuprofen via comparison of both and via comparison with the novel combined drug. We have taken into account the side effect profile of the study drugs. This review will help oral surgeons to decide on which analgesic to prescribe following wisdom tooth removal.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:33:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the novel combination of both in a single tablet for pain relief following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth, at different doses and administered postoperatively.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:34:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group'sTrials Register (to 20 May 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 4); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 20 May 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2013) and the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (to 20 May 2013). We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for further studies. We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied to the searches of the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:34:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only randomised controlled double-blinded clinical trials were included. Cross-over studies were included provided there was a wash out period of at least 14 days. There had to be a direct comparison in the trial of two or more of the trial drugs at any dosage. All trials used the third molar pain model.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:36:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors, any disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary a third review author was consulted. The proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief (based on total pain relief (TOTPAR) and summed pain intensity difference (SPID) data) was calculated for all three drugs at both two and six hours postdosing and meta-analysed for comparison. The proportion of participants using rescue medication over both six and eight hours was also collated and compared. The number of patients experiencing adverse events or the total number of adverse events reported or both were analysed for comparison.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:40:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven studies were included, they were all parallel-group studies, two studies were assessed as at low risk of bias and three at high risk of bias; two were considered to have unclear bias in their methodology. A total of 2241 participants were enrolled in these trials.</P>
<P>Ibuprofen was found to be a superior analgesic to paracetamol at several doses with high quality evidence suggesting that ibuprofen 400 mg is superior to 1000 mg paracetamol based on pain relief (estimated from TOTPAR data) and the use of rescue medication meta-analyses. The risk ratio for at least 50% pain relief (based on TOTPAR) at six hours was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.69; five trials) favouring 400 mg ibuprofen over 1000 mg paracetamol, and the risk ratio for not using rescue medication (also favouring ibuprofen) was 1.50 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.79; four trials).</P>
<P>The combined drug showed promising results, with a risk ratio for at least 50% of the maximum pain relief over six hours of 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.39) (paracetamol 1000 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg) (one trial; moderate quality evidence), and risk ratio not using rescue medication 1.60 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.88) (two trials; moderate quality evidence). </P>
<P>The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups. However, we could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-10 15:41:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high quality evidence that ibuprofen is superior to paracetamol at doses of 200 mg to 512 mg and 600 mg to 1000 mg respectively based on pain relief and use of rescue medication data collected at six hours postoperatively. The majority of this evidence (five out of six trials) compared ibuprofen 400 mg with paracetamol 1000 mg, these are the most frequently prescribed doses in clinical practice. The novel combination drug is showing encouraging results based on the outcomes from two trials when compared to the single drugs.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-10 21:17:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-10 21:17:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In England alone, approximately 63,000 third molars are removed in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals each year (calculated from data available from Hospital Episode Statistics (<A HREF="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes">HES</A>)). Worldwide the number of surgical operations to remove wisdom teeth is immense. Research suggests that wisdom tooth removal has an immediate negative impact on patients' working and social lives: in one study patients took an average of 1.6 days off work, with over one third of patients stating that the surgery had affected their performance at work (<LINK REF="REF-Colorado_x002d_Bonnin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colorado-Bonnin 2006</LINK>), and participation in social activities, sports and other hobbies is also negatively affected (<LINK REF="REF-Conrad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conrad 1999</LINK>). For many patients quality of life (QoL) is reduced for one to two weeks after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Savin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savin 1997</LINK>). Postoperative complications may include swelling, bruising and limited mouth opening along with difficulty with eating which can be a major concern to patients and has not been appreciated by healthcare professionals in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 1998</LINK>). However, patients are often most concerned about postoperative pain, which may be severe. Approximately one in two patients will experience pain despite analgesic therapy, even one week after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Savin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savin 1997</LINK>). The pain experienced after oral surgery is a validated and widely used pain model for the clinical evaluation of analgesic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1976</LINK>). Tissue damage produced during surgery releases chemicals that initiate inflammatory pain by activating and sensitising nerve fibre receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Loeser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeser 1999</LINK>). Chemicals include bradykinin, prostaglandins, serotonin and histamine (<LINK REF="REF-Dray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dray 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-10 20:54:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many textbooks of oral surgery practice and drug formularies advocate the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the management of postoperative pain, and these drugs have been widely used for pain relief in dentistry for some time (<LINK REF="REF-Gobetti-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gobetti 1992</LINK>). There are now over 50 different NSAIDs on the global market. One of the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs is ibuprofen, with 4.5 million prescriptions for ibuprofen being issued in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>). Ibuprofen has been the subject of much research into its efficacy in postoperative dental pain (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>). The newer drugs decrease the incidence of gastric perforation, obstruction and bleeding by at least 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Boers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boers 2001</LINK>). However, these drugs provide no cardio-protection and may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ibuprofen has been shown to be an effective analgesic in the control of postoperative dental pain in a number of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hersh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winter-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1978</LINK>). Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been commercially available since 1953 making it one of the oldest analgesics on the market. Both ibuprofen and paracetamol are amongst the most commonly used analgesics and are widely available without prescription around the world. Paracetamol is of particular value when NSAIDS are contraindicated, perhaps by known hypersensitivity or a history of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1999</LINK>). It is also the analgesic of choice to supplement NSAIDS when these alone are expected to be ineffective to control pain (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1998</LINK>). Pain intensity following third molar surgery has been suggested to reach its maximum between three to five hours following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1985</LINK>) and therefore this pain model is used to test the efficacy of a single analgesic dose.</P>
<P>The combining of analgesic drugs with different modes of action in order to increase the analgesic effect has been well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehlisch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehlisch 2002</LINK>). In 2010, a single combination drug containing both paracetamol and ibuprofen was first licensed for use in the UK. In one study using the third molar pain model, the combination analgesic was shown to be a highly effective drug that was comparable with, or superior to, other combination analgesics marketed for severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2011</LINK>). This drug continues to provide encouraging results in analgesic trials. Indeed, a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>) compared the combined drug (paracetamol plus ibuprofen) with placebo or the same dose of oral ibuprofen alone using the postoperative dental pain model. The authors concluded that ibuprofen plus paracetamol combinations provided better analgesia than either drug alone (at the same dose), with a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours, and with a smaller chance of experiencing an adverse event.</P>
<P>Recent systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>) have looked at the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen and paracetamol individually, without direct comparison, for postoperative pain management. These reviews have included the findings of studies involving a wide variety of types of surgery such as inguinal hernia surgery, caesarean section, orthopaedic surgery and including the removal of wisdom teeth. Only one review to date looks at paracetamol specifically in relation to postoperative third molar removal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 2007</LINK>), although two other reviews of single dose postoperative analgesics include subgroup analyses for dental pain only (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>). There is some debate as to whether dental pain is different from other pain. It has been suggested that the effect of some analgesics including tramadol was worse for dental pain than for other types of postsurgical pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-10 21:17:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NSAIDs are assumed largely to produce their analgesia as a result of the inhibition of prostaglandin production by the enzyme cyclol-oxygenase (<LINK REF="REF-Malmberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmberg 1992</LINK>). This prostaglandin inhibition is also responsible for the loss of gastric protection and consequent ulceration and bleeding that can occur. NSAIDs have the ability to inhibit the fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase enzyme, thereby inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2012</LINK>). Cyclo-oxygenases (COX) oxidise arachidonate producing unstable intermediate prostaglandins PGG<SUB>2</SUB> and PGH<SUB>2</SUB>. There are two main isoforms of COX: COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme and COX-2 is often induced by inflammatory stimuli. Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are nociceptive initiators which lead to painful sensations in the body. It is thought that the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions of the NSAIDs are related to inhibition of COX-2 and that the unwanted effects, particularly the gastrointestinal consequences are related to inhibition of COX-1. A recent development has been the synthesis of selective COX-2 inhibitors; examples include celecoxib, etoricoxib and lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Neal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a non-opioid analgesic possessing antipyretic activity and is effective in relieving pain with a low incidence of adverse effects, it has proven to be a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 2007</LINK>). Paracetamol is often grouped with the NSAID family, however, it is considered only to have relatively weak anti-inflammatory activity (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2012</LINK>). Although the mechanism of action was not fully understood until recently, it is now thought that paracetamol is a selective inhibitor of the newly described COX-3 enzyme, a cyclo-oxygenase-1 variant, in the central nervous system where it acts as a prodrug. It is deacylated to p-aminophenol and in turn conjugated with arachidonic acid to form N-arachidonoyl-phenolamine. This compound is an endogenous cannabinoid, acting on CB1 receptors, and is also an agonist at TRPV1 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 2010</LINK>). This inhibition could represent a primary central mechanism by which paracetamol decreases pain and possibly fever (<LINK REF="REF-Chandrasekharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandrasekharan 2002</LINK>). It also has been shown to be an effective analgesic in the control of postoperative dental pain in a number of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Bentley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiersch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiersch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehlisch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehlisch 1990</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-12-10 20:54:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Authors commonly report on the results of analgesic trials using mean data with associated standard deviations, this is a problem as the data may be asymmetrically distributed and if used in meta-analyses will lead to potentially erroneous conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>). It is therefore important to derive dichotomous data from the continuous data presented in trials prior to using the data in meta-analyses. The team at the Oxford Pain Relief Unit and Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics have derived a method for dichotomising these data; the detailed background and verification were published over three papers (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the data presented in the trials, the proportion of patients achieving 50% pain relief (50% maximum TOTPAR) was calculated and used in the meta-analysis. Other Cochrane reviews have made use of these measures in their analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weil-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 2007</LINK>). SPID essentially measures the same thing as TOTPAR. If data were unavailable to calculate TOTPAR, SPID would have been calculated. If data on both TOTPAR and SPID were available, TOTPAR was chosen in preference. Outcomes were assessed for two hours and six hours postdosing (where possible). For these dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-12-10 16:41:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The unit of analysis is individual patients, although appropriate cross-over studies were included. If data from patients in the same treatment group were used in more than one dose comparison for meta-analysis, the number of patients was split between the groups. For example, if 50 out of 100 patients achieved the desired outcome by taking 1000 mg of paracetamol and these data were to be compared with two different doses of ibuprofen, the figures for the analysis were halved (25 out of 50 for each comparison).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-12-10 16:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), there are several types of missing data in a systematic review or meta-analysis. The problem of missing studies and outcomes is addressed in the <LINK TAG="BIAS_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of reporting biases</LINK> part of this review. A common problem is missing summary data, such as standard deviations for continuous outcomes, or separate sample sizes for each intervention group. Missing summary data were not a reason to exclude a study from the review and methods outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were used for imputing missing standard deviations. In the analysis we made the assumption that the data were missing at random, so we included only available data. The authors were contacted where possible for missing data.

We interpreted a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test resulting in a P value &lt; 0.10 as indicating statistically significant heterogeneity. In order to assess and quantify the possible magnitude of inconsistency (i.e. heterogeneity) across studies, we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with a rough guide for interpretation as follows: 0% to 40% might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 1995</LINK>, at least two third molars were removed, one of which was impacted in bone.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Type of anaesthetic used</HEADING>
<P>The anaesthetic used for the surgical procedure varied in the studies. In two studies, general anaesthetic with supplemental local anaesthetic was used (<LINK REF="STD-Forbes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Forbes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 1995</LINK>). Local anaesthetic alone was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Olson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2001</LINK>). Local anaesthetic with supplemental sedation was used in four studies, one using inhalation sedation with nitrous oxides (<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2009</LINK>), two with nitrous oxide, diazepam and a barbituate (<LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010a</LINK>) and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hersh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hersh 2000</LINK>) "most patients" received intravenous conscious sedation. It is important to be aware of whether trial participants were sedated as certain sedative agents commonly used in oral surgery, namely midazolam, have been shown to have an analgesic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 1993</LINK>). This effect could have influenced the results of the trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of doses of analgesic given</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of data extraction in this review, only the data from the first postoperative dose were used.

In <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010a</LINK>, three doses were provided and in <LINK REF="STD-Forbes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Forbes 1990</LINK> there were 15. None of the included studies provided preoperative analgesics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Baseline pain intensity</HEADING>
<P>It is important that baseline pain intensity measures are included in trials; baseline pain provides the reference point from which the degree of pain relief or an increase or decrease in pain intensity can be measured. In analgesic trials, it is necessary for participants to be experiencing a certain amount of pain before the analgesic is administered in order for the efficacy of the drug to be tested. If participants have no pain at the outset then there is no point in providing analgesics as there will be no improvement in pain scores. The included studies varied in their criteria for baseline pain intensity (as in how much pain a participant has to be experiencing prior to receiving a dose of the test analgesic). Five of the studies used a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a dosing threshold of <U>&gt;</U> 50 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hersh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hersh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2001</LINK>); in the <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2009</LINK> study, the VAS had to be between 50 mm and 85 mm prior to dosing, the reason for defining an upper limit for VAS was not specified. In the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Forbes-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Forbes 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 1995</LINK>), the dosing threshold was described using a categorical scale whereby the participant had to state that they were suffering from moderate or severe pain prior to dosing (this roughly translates to the VAS threshold used by the more recent studies).</P>

The overall risk ratio was 1.60 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.88; P value &lt; 0.00001) indicating that 60% more patients used rescue medication over six hours in the individual constituent drug group compared to the combined drug group. There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity (P value = 0.02; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82%), however this meta-analysis included only data from two trials and has to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In all of the above comparisons, the combined formula of the drug was favoured (see forest plots).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Side effects profile</HEADING>
<P>All studies had information on the adverse events observed during the entire study period. This information is used to create the safety profile of the study drugs. Data on serious or severe adverse events were also collected and collated as a percentage of total adverse events (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The vast majority of adverse events were minor in nature and usually included nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness. No severe adverse events were thought to be definitely linked to the analgesic drugs or placebos used. It is worth noting that these data were collected in the immediate postoperative period following surgery under local anaesthetic with additional sedation or general anaesthetic in most cases (all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2001</LINK> which used local anaesthetic alone), the anaesthetic drugs could be related to the adverse events observed. In Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, there is evidence that the frequency of observed adverse events is slightly lower in the <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2001</LINK> study, adding further weight to this argument. In <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 2010</LINK>, the observed frequency of adverse events was high, the authors explained that the events were likely to have been caused by the heavy sedation used for surgery.</P>
<P>Side effect profiles have not been included in a meta-analysis as multiple adverse events were recorded in single patients, it was not possible from the data to work out how many adverse events there were in total. However, Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> shows that the differences in the observed adverse events for ibuprofen and paracetamol were small and there were no apparent differences between the groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>Using the software GRADEprofiler 3.6, the quality of the body of evidence was assessed for both comparisons: ibuprofen versus paracetamol, and combined (ibuprofen and paracetamol) versus single drugs. TOTPAR, and use of rescue medication were assessed as SPID is measuring the same thing as TOTPAR. A summary of these findings for the two comparisons is shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. These tables show that all of the outcomes for comparing ibuprofen versus paracetamol are assessed as at high quality. The comparisons for combined (ibuprofen and paracetamol) versus single drugs for TOTPAR are both moderate as they were downgraded due to being based on single studies and the imprecision of estimate. The evidence for use of rescue medication was assessed as high quality.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-12-10 17:37:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The surgical removal of lower third molar teeth continues to be a frequently performed surgical procedure carried out by oral surgeons worldwide. Adequate management of pain is of paramount importance to both the patient and surgeon, and also those involved in the commissioning of services as pain experience can be used as a method for measuring the quality of an oral surgey service. All healthcare decisions should be supported by a sound evidence base, this review will form part of the evidence base that oral surgeons should look to when making decisions on how best to manage their patient's postoperative pain.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 12:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ibuprofen has superior efficacy to paracetamol at all doses studied in this review. Novel drugs which combine paracetamol and ibuprofen formulations within the same tablet are showing encouraging results and based on limited evidence largely based on time to re-medication, appear to be superior analgesics to the constituent drugs taken individually. The reasons for this could be related to the formulation of the combination drug, although this is by no means confirmed in the literature at present. The rationale for combined analgesia is that enhanced pain relief can potentially be achieved from two drugs with different modes of action using a lower dose and with reduced side effects, this is the basis for developing combination analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-10 17:31:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the included trials only looked at pain relief and intensity data following a single dose of the trial analgesic in a postoperative pain setting. From a clinical point of view, this model has limitations although it is the most frequently used method to assess the efficacy of analgesics. As we know, pain does continue following the initial analgesic dose and the drugs evaluated in this review are normally prescribed to be taken at a frequency of every six to eight hours (maximum of four times per day allowing for time spent sleeping). It would be of interest to know what the pain experience is following the second and subsequent doses of these medications.</P>
<P>All included studies used the 'third molar' pain model or 'dental pain' model to assess their outcomes. This method of pain modelling has been criticised due to not being representative of the entire population. The patients who are enrolled on to these studies would typically be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>aged under 30 years;</LI>
<LI>in good general health;</LI>
<LI>lacking in previous surgical interventions; and</LI>
<LI>physically fit and active.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These categories will not apply to the entire population (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Within the review we presented TOTPAR (total pain relief) data at two and six hours postdosing. We are aware that TOTPAR equations have only been validated for four- and six-hour data (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). Results for two hours, presented within this review, should be interpreted with caution, although from a clinical perspective it was felt that two-hour data were more clinically relevant than four-hour.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-10 17:34:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As only double-blinded (for participant and outcome assessor) randomised controlled trials were included, the risk of bias was low for two trials, unclear for two trials and high for three trials where there was concern that the type of anaesthetic given may have introduced bias and some lack of detail as to how the participants were randomised. The summary of findings tables present the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison and this was assessed as high quality for comparing paracetamol and ibuprofen; this means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimates of the effect. The body of evidence for the proportion of patients with &gt; 50% maximum pain relief (TOTPAR) over two and six hours, when comparing combined (ibuprofen and paracetamol) versus single drugs, was assessed as moderate quality due to these being single studies or based on high risk of bias trials; this means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The body of evidence for the use of rescue medication was assessed as being of high quality.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-10 17:37:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on previously published Cochrane reviews using only the third molar model for assessing analgesics, 400 mg ibuprofen has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.3 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 2.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), and 975 mg to 1000 mg paracetamol has an NNT of 3.6 (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 4.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>). Therefore the conclusions from this review are in agreement with those from existing Cochrane reviews demonstrating that ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than paracetamol at the most frequently prescribed doses. The superiority of the combined drugs over the individual drugs is also echoed by another recent Cochrane review which found that participants had a smaller chance of requiring rescue medication over eight hours if they took the combined drug compared to the individual agents (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-10 17:39:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is high quality evidence that ibuprofen is superior to paracetamol at doses of 200 mg to 512 mg and 600 mg to 1000 mg respectively based on pain relief, pain intensity difference and use of rescue medication data collected at six hours postoperatively. The majority of this evidence (five out of six trials) compared ibuprofen 400 mg with paracetamol 1000 mg, these are the most frequently used doses in clinical practice.</P>
<P>This review proves ibuprofen to be superior to paracetamol in terms of analgesic efficacy when used postoperatively for pain management following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth (third molars). It is important to be aware that the data in this review only relate to single dose postoperative usage of the trial drugs. The combined drugs containing both agents show promising outcomes, with meta-analysis of use of rescue medication at eight hours providing high quality evidence that the combined drugs are superior to the single drugs. It has been suggested that these findings could be due to the formulation of the combined drug having a faster onset of analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2011</LINK>). However, we found that at two hours postoperatively, there was no significant difference between the paracetamol, ibuprofen and combined drug, implying that the drug had a 'delayed' effect relative to the single drug. That is, at six hours the combined drug was more effective.</P>
<P>All drugs studied in this review are generally considered safe with minimal side effects noted when used for short-term pain relief.</P>
<P>It is important to remember that many patients are able to tolerate paracetamol and ibuprofen, and on the basis of evidence in this review prescribing both analgesics either as individual tablets or in combination would take advantage of their differing pharmacological properties and achieve adequate pain relief following the surgical removal of lower third molar teeth.</P>

<P>There is a vast amount of evidence demonstrating that both paracetamol and ibuprofen are effective and safe for managing postoperative pain for minor surgical procedures such as the removal of wisdom teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weil-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 2007</LINK>).

<P>The original protocol was written focusing purely on the individual administration of ibuprofen versus paracetamol. Since publication of the protocol a new combination drug (marketed as Nuromol), containing both paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet, was launched in the United Kingdom. This drug has shown promising results to date and we have chosen to also compare the combined drug with the single drugs using this model.</P>
<P>Quality assessment has been updated to reflect the change to risk of bias assessment.</P>
<P>The following subgroup analysis was removed as the review only focuses on postoperative pain relief: the time of administration of ibuprofen or paracetamol differs: preoperative versus postoperative.</P>

<P>Pain severity was evaluated using the categorical pain scale at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and then at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours following study drug administration.</P>
<P>At each assessment, patients rated their pain intensity and pain relief using the following categorical rating scale for pain intensity: none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. For pain relief, the following were used: none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete relief = 4.</P>
<P>A stopwatch was used to describe meaningful pain relief time.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the 6-hour evaluation period or at the time of re-medication (if it occurred before the 6th hour), each subject provided an overall evaluation of the study medication on a 5-point categorical scale (from poor = 0 to excellent = 4).</P>
<P>If rescue medication was taken, no further measures were made. Time to rescue medication was also recorded.</P>
